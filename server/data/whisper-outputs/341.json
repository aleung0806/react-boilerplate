    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. Today today is August 2nd, 2022 and this is episode 341 on the coast. Mark Ames coming to you from Rochester, New York. And I'm online first of all, we'll just say with the Warner, John Dolan aka Gary, a bit of chatty who is in the toe of Italy right now, right John? And, um, I think it was one of the metaphors you could use, yes. Trope. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Trope is beautiful, but difficult to do a podcast from. That's all I'll say about that. Okay, we'll save that for maybe a little bit later. We don't want to wake us. We want to bring on right away, very excited to have on the hosts, the coast of the blowback podcast Noah Cohen and Brendan James not to be confused with Brendan and Rick Arvind. It's a Brynn Dan with an A and anyway, first of all, welcome to the show guys and thanks for coming on. Thank you. Thanks for having me. Thanks for having me. Yeah. So, first of all, I just want to say huge congratulations because it is, it's a great series of episodes and it's 10 episodes plus a whole lot of bonus material on the Korean War. We at Radio Warner have touched on it. In fact, you guys have Tim Shorick who's been a guest on Radio Warner. Tim is great. We've had him on. We didn't cover the whole war and there's just so much there and so remarkably unjustifiably little about the Korean War compared to its significance in terms of how it remade the world since and in terms of how many fucking people were killed and that more too and how much damage and destruction. But anyway, recommended to everybody will obviously post links. I think first before we go into the Korean War though, I just wanted to ask you, I wanted to get a little bit about the podcast itself blowback because this is your third season, your first season when you guys, I mean, I remember people freaking out about this and loving it. You guys did a season on the Iraq war, which was such an interesting, it was so perfect and yet it was sort of like, well, why hadn't anybody thought of it? Because the Iraq war is just starting to leave recent memory and Mnej is like massively set in. So it was already actually due for a lot of recovered history, how totally fucking crazy it was. And I mean, did you guys, did you guys think about it? Like is it too soon to do the Iraq war? Or you both of you guys young enough where it's sort of like, well, I was only half sentient at the time. I really want to know what went on. You know, now that I'm kind of a little older and I see all the shit going on now. Well I remember Noah and I were having dinner and he, he, I had recently come off of my old show, Chapel Trap House, which I had left around 2018. And I wasn't sure exactly what the next project would be and Noah suggested a show about the Iraq war, just specifically about the Iraq war. And I remember thinking, why, you know, what, you know, is that really, is that really something we need to do? Because I'm a little older than Noah. I'm 31. And when I was, I was about half sentient when it, when it was breaking out and, you know, by the time it ended, I was getting out of high school. But I thought that it was to your point, a relatively well-known popular, right, history of, oh, it was about WMDs after 9-11 and then they weren't there. And it was bad and it was a big mistake and everyone knows that now. And I, I sort of brushed it off as a terribly necessary thing to revisit. But then I think several days after I was starting to notice more and more the rehabilitation in the Trump era, because this was still in the middle of the Trump presidency. I was noticing the rehabilitation of the Bush administration figures like Bush himself Dick Cheney even, I saw a member in the New Yorker. He was described as part of a meeting of the hashtag resistance figures like John McCain and other supporters of the war. Bill Crystal on MSNBC all the time. The migration of all those of Neocon guys to MSNBC in the context of Russia gate and all of that was a huge shuffling of the, of the deck. And I started to think maybe there is a reason to revisit this. And especially because there are even younger people than us who didn't experience it at all, like even as a, as a piece of background or wallpaper growing up. And so we, we decided to take the plunge and it was something we knew a bit about already. But we definitely learned more as we went as we do with every season we do. And it was fascinating to try to, well, we was fascinating to us, was sort of experiencing it all over again. And that sort of informed the way we wanted to structure the show, was to really make it as immersive as possible, not just to have it be a lecture, but have it be a bit of, with all these, you know, audio drops and, you know, pieces of ephemera to try and make you feel like if you were alive at the time. Those are particularly beautiful. Yes. I mean, thank you. Which we did some graphics or something, or something. But yeah, I also want to applaud you for doing something on Iraq when I know exactly what the line would be because I ran into an academic version of this when I was trying to be a grads in doing things like, well, wait, I think it actually matters whether people think an autobiographical poem is actually true. And everybody said, well, that's obvious. That's no, no, no, that's so obvious that shut up. And I think this is the way the word obvious works. We know the Iraq war was a mistake. So shut up about it. And that's a very bad bit of advice to take. I mean, the obvious is usually, when it's used as a pejorative, it's used to shut you up. And you can't go with that. Yeah. I think that's also informing our Korean season as well, our Korean war season because we can get into this later. But the very cliche now of the forgotten war is in itself a kind of propaganda that says, yeah, we remembered it. So move on now. Don't worry. We, we, we, on all the book jackets now, it says forgotten war. So we've done that. And we don't need to focus on it. Thanks. Right. And I think a lot of people would wish that the Iraq war was a forgotten war too, you know. And there's that old confusion. There's an old confusion saying what all men speak well of look critically into, what all men condemn, examine first before you decide. So that's sort of the kind of guiding light of our, of our show in a way that we, my, my, I'll give credit to Noah. He's the one who proposed the Iraq thing. And I had that initial thing of, oh, it's obvious. But then it quickly became clear that, hey, it's not so obvious. And be as John just said, that's sometimes when you need to revisit something. Right. And it goes without saying also that that was sort of our thinking on, on Cuba where it's like, you know, the story is very different from the Korean War, the story of the Cuban Revolution. However, you know, as something that it honestly did not occur to me that this was the case until, you know, we were actually like in the last days of editing the show, but there's actually literally a clip where we drop where, you know, they're talking about, I'm down to Saddam, Fidel and Kim Il Sung, as like what Powell says in the 90s or something. And so it's like, yeah, well, that's the first three seasons of blowback, you know. Now what do we do? He didn't list anything. Yeah, we're really screaming. You know, we're, like, we have an audience. Of course, we have some ideas, but we, we were hoping to just always take direction from Colin Powell as we went. Yeah. And we say that kind of sadly, right? Like sort of that's all I got left of these clowns. Yeah, it's like the Beatles dying off for. Yeah. So, yeah, I just remember seeing before I had actually listened to it a lot of people sort of on social media saying, wow, I forgot A, B and C about Iraq. Basically, I forgot how totally crazy that time was, which is why it's such a great thing that you guys took a very different tack, which is that deep immersion in a way, like, you know, you hear the actual clips again, you hear the crazy from its time. I remember that time and I, I mean, I, so I was in Russia so I could still, you literally see it with some distance and it really seemed so damn crazy to, I mean, John, you were also in Russia, I think, at the time. And it's not like, you know, Russia was a bastion of sanity, but from far away, it was, it was so clearly insane and the whole culture was so clearly out of its mind. Well, I mean, you, as much as I developed the war nerd character because of the sudden proliferation of self-proclaimed war buffs all through the US media and they were saying insane things that could be easily contradicted if you just looked at 20th century warfare as if it would all be over once you went through and bombed the place and sent the tanks through. And I just thought, you know, using the language from my rotten schools instead of the elevated diction that I had to learn to fake as a failed academic, it's like, maybe you can make, in fact, definitely you can make a case that this is a stupid idea, but not from the, you know, squishy liberal angle, just this fucking bad idea, it's a terrible idea in military terms. It's by ignorant people. And yeah, so it was actually a desperate attempt to get through to people. And I think it got through to some, but it mostly annoyed and bothered them. And I don't know that it did actually go. Yeah. Let me ask you just a little bit more about your podcast and then we'll get to the Korean war. I mean, you guys, so Brendan, you came from Chappell first, right? And I was their original producer and I was there for about two years. Okay. And before that, I was, I was like Noah, I was a full-time journalist for several years, ever since I got out of college. So that was my pedigree. Right. And when you guys, I mean, did you guys, because you do do one thing that's quite different from Chappell and Truanon and Radio Warner, not all of us, I mean, certainly we're about as low tech except for the fact that we have the great Brendan Andering as our sound engineer. But we don't do clips and music and stuff and that makes it harder. You know, that makes it, that means you have to do a lot more planning and the shows have to be better produced without sounding like they're, you know, overly produced, which you guys do a great job of that as well. But I mean, how did you, how did you, did you come to that right away or did you guys kind of start figuring out, well, we're actually not going to be able to kind of do just a series of, let's kind of package them as whole seasons or. And also like, how did you get the rights for all that stuff to or is that a difficult thing? Yeah, we're, yeah, we're not supposed to sing stuff. We, we got rights when we cleared music when, I mean, honestly, that's sort of part part of the answer to the music question is I composed the music for the show that we, we, we, we, we clear stuff when we can. But normally it doesn't need to be cleared because I am a, John, if you're talking about your past life as an academic, I was once going to be in school for composition, classical composition. And I left that, you know, a long time ago. And but it, not necessarily been something I wanted to leave behind. And so all these years, I've kind of wished to find another venue for that. And of course, hijacking this show and turning it into a way for me to continue to compose music and have people hear it was a great option for me. And luckily, people have seemed to enjoy the music because we, we knew from the start, we wanted to give it a bit of a cinematic flavor. We wanted it to feel, you know, I come from, like I said, you know, Chop was a talk show. And it's a great, it's great at doing that. But this was going to be different. Right. And so we thought a bit of music, a bit of, you know, atmosphere would, would set it apart. And it wouldn't be so much a conversation. But we also didn't want it to be a lecture either. We wanted it to be just a good story, a well told compelling story. And so you can hear a bit of differences, I think particularly from the first season. And then, and then the, the second and third or more of a kind because it was our first season. We were trying stuff out. But it, it, we went from bantering a bit more to kind of writing stuff a lot more thoroughly in season two and certainly three and, and pacing things out ahead of time a lot more. So it did evolve a bit. We didn't know exactly what we wanted to do at first. But once it became clear that the strength of the show, according to our listeners, was the way it unfurled a narrative and the way that it kind of, as we spoke about before, we try to immerse people that without overdoing it, we wanted to have that element of sort of a, laying it out almost like a show or a film you can't see. You're hearing music, you're hearing, you know, characters come along without being too corny about it. And have that be the kind of trademark of the show compared to more didactic. And definitely useful in other contexts, but the kind of stuff we were hearing at the time. And you know, the other part of that is I think that to compliment the kind of the, you know, sort of like, what are we, I guess, like, you know, like content-wise, you know, what are we filling this like really, you know, like, like, exciting kind of style of presentation. We have, you know, Brennan and I have just, you know, it's like every season feels a little bit like writing a book. So we're mostly reading and, you know, interviewing different people. But it feels very, like, you know, it's very research-driven. And so while we're ultimately, you know, we're really trying to tell a compelling story. The, you know, the most fun thing about it to me. And what I, you know, what, like, where I get to let my free flag fly, so to speak, is in, like, you know, going into, like, old newspaper archives, for example, like, especially with this career season. And, you know, using the fact that, like, the internet and all these resources, you know, make it fairly easy to develop an idea of how people felt and thought at the time, when these things were going on. You know, and that was something that, you know, we sort of did, you know, the Iraq war is sort of like, you have YouTube and these sort, you know, proto-internet, you know, proto, as in, like, before this present period, like, internet culture. But, you know, back then, you know, in the times of Cuba or Korea, like getting to sort of, like, bask in the, you know, like, newspaper, magazine archives and developing a sense, you know, from that media and other sources about, you know, like, something more complex and nuanced than, you know, what the canned history is. You don't have to have a, you know, preconceived narrative or anything. But, like, that, you know, the, the freedom to just go in and pull a good story out of that research is a tremendously exciting thing. And I would agree with Noah that's the most fun part. For me, it's the research and the music. When we have to start hearing our own voices, that's when it starts to really get to. No, no, no, same person can stand. You'd have to be crazy to love the sound of your own voice. Yes. But, but I, I will say, you know, it's, it's also a bit more persuasive. I feel when we present a story, we're obviously coming from a point of view. I think that's what people like about the show. But, um, we, we try not to inject our opinions really too much. And there, again, there is a time and a place for that. And I used to work kind of in that zone. But it, it feels, um, we've, we've heard, certainly heard feedback from people who say, I showed this to my, what I thought would be my clothes-minded, you know, 80-year-olds, ID-log grandad, and he was enjoying it. And so there's something about the storytelling, you know, avenue that I think sort of can be more approachable for people who wouldn't necessarily want to have anything to do with our perspective at first. So that's nice. And getting to compose the music for that sounds incredible. I always thought John Carpenter must have the best jobs. You know, you get to make the movies. You said the magic phrase, John. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. John Carpenter is an idol of mine. And there's something, you know, very, oh, yeah, I mean, the music that I do for the show, it's, it's, you know, it grows and changes a little bit each season. But I certainly am taking a lot of cues, so to speak, from Carpenter. And I loved, always loved that as a kid, is how he was in full control. I mean, that wasn't necessarily reflected. When you say he's, you know, that you want to be a control freak, it has a different ring to it. But I do, I always loved that he wrote and edited and did all that stuff himself. And so with, of course, with Noah, I'm on the, the side of telling the story, but also, I get to, you know, not have to hand it off to anyone because I'm that deranged that I want to score my own thing. But so yeah, the music is very fun. And it's, it's often the, the kind of highlight from me every season as well. To just add something very small to what Brennan said about, like, you know, the stuff that we learned from each other, like, something that I've sort of, like, rocked from him also in the process of making this is just like the power of restraint and storytelling. And, you know, it's like, I know that like, it's kind of like a Twitter joke now that like, you know, like showing and not telling is a CIA, like, opera something. But like, I'm here to tell you that like, yeah, like, yeah, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, yeah, like, whereas, you know, I'm here to tell you, like, listen, like, you know, I, I, like, used to like, write up, like, you know, articles about earnings report for Silicon Valley. And, you know, I've made it to this point. And it's like, it's not an op. It really does make the communication of information way more persuasive and, and legible. And it's been, it's been, that's, that's actually like, you know, that that part, you know, sort of figuring out how to tell this like, crazy, rich story with just like, force of fact is the primary, you know, like, engine of it is, it's terrifically fine. And I'm, and I'm not even fully sure, thank God, what elements of the discourse you're talking about, Noah, online, maybe, you know, that there's what, that it's, um, yeah, your, your hermitage pays off here. Thanks. But, but I would actually, I feel as though nowadays, because anything can be weaponized by, you know, if the argument here is that a certain style of, of storytelling is, um, more advantageous to, uh, canned narratives at the CIA or the official history in America is supposed to hem to, I would say that now putting your stink on it and being hyper opinionated and, and using all the buzzwords that go along with the current moment of, um, some form of, um, popular, uh, DSA or, or, you know, like, like, leftism or whatever being in vogue and being, you know, co-opted by so many people, you could, just as easily argue the opposite that, you know, adopting a bit of restraint prevents people from getting the wool put over their eyes by buzzwords and by, you know, um, trendy, uh, opinions and trendy memes or whatever that is supposed to, you know, uh, Trojan horse, you went, you know, through the gate by saying, no, I'm, I'm not a stuffy reactionary. I just, uh, I just called Mitch McConnell a freaking dumpster fire, you know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm, I'm actually, I may work at Lockheed Martin, but I just, I'm on the internet. There you go. I mean, there you have it. So yeah, I like that's, that's related as, you know, as, as a, uh, troll bite who actually lived through the pre-internet era. I think, um, there was something that I'm sure you must find shockingly or, and then, uh, promisingly naive or naked about a lot of Cold War rhetoric because it was meant to be, uh, gate kept by a very few people and it was also meant to be instantly disappearable. I was, it was made as a famerate. You can see that in, in movies versus videos because there were all these, you know, it came down to, you know, come on, we want you to do a naked shot. I'll be on screen for like half a second. That was true up until the internet and then it was not true at all anymore. I think there must be some sort of analogy to news stories and opinion page stories from the Cold War as well. They were meant to be excited when everybody was excited, but then they were meant to be disappearable and they're not. Right. But especially with Iraq as well. Yeah. I got to say, I mean, uh, speaking of research, um, some of the stuff you guys quoted from the New York Times, the way they were, I mean, it's pretty, talk about pretty damn shocking. I don't, it sounds like, it sounds like they're stirmer. Yeah. It's, I mean, no, it's truly, I mean, it's, it's a very, I mean, I, I've always thought I've recently pitched a friend on like, listen, like somebody needs to do just like a gigantic piece or a book about like the New York Times as, you know, with just like, and like make the cover, like blood red or something. Like a hidden history or a counter history of the New York Times, especially while that institution is writing as high as it is, like, it's, yeah, that's really my big, late list. The black book of the New York Times, you know, all of its crimes, you know, seriously. Yeah. I mean, I'm just, you're probably referencing some of the, uh, choice quotes we drop in from, I believe several of them, but by no means all of them were from the military editor, Hansen Baldwin at the time, who would openly describe the Koreans as some, some ratio between gangus cons hordes and Hitler's hordes. They were, the Koreans were somehow both hypermodern and well in tune with the Blitzkrieg of the day while also being, sort of troglidites whose only concern was the next bit of booty or the next bit, you know, the next woman they could ravage. And also they're like, gangus con, you know, that leader from the millennia go, who's like a thousand miles or whatever to the north to the north. And of course, just the, just the slur guk, which is exactly in headlines in the AP. It's associated press, you know, and, and it was a surprise as the Americans began to get their asses kicked. I know we can start talking about the war, but that, that it was like, oh, I thought these were supposed to be apes that we were fighting. And, and, and everything in the language, from the New York Times on down before you even get to the, you know, the more tabloid headlines and publications was calling these people literally barbarians, not in quotes, but in just the, the core text. So, yeah. And it was interesting like the word Google, the slur, it comes from the, you know, the Philippine American war, which is, you know, basically our suppression of Philippine national movement after the, in the, you know, in the embers of the Spanish-American war. And it, you know, it's to me, it was a really instructive of how racism as an ideology, you know, as a technology, like where, you know, in the same way that anti-blackness was, you know, a anti-black racism was developed as, you know, in response to and as a part of, you know, the institution of transatlantic slavery. So here you have like this intense, you know, racism and othering that is developing to help administer, you know, this, this, you know, a then nascent imperial project. It was strange though, because we've, we've mentioned in, in several episodes, the, the lack of that across the board. It's like Mark and I both went through undergrad at Berkeley. I don't remember learning about Go Bears. Asian history, much at all, you know, yes. It was like there was a big blank there. These massive, massive wars, the Typing rebellion, the most bloody war of the 90s. I mean, you know, like, never heard of it. I also went to Berkeley and the thing that struck me in recent years is that like, you know, there's the CV star, the Cornelius V star East Asian Library, like on the campus, you know, like one of these like, you know, imperial robber bearer and figures. And I mean, like, you know, I just found her AIG, like, you know, to me, the, you know, you're dead on, like it's, it's totally in the collected. Well, there's something interesting there too, because as we sort of touch on at the beginning of this season, as things are kicking off post-war war two, or even really before the war is concluded, Asia was not really supposed to be the next front of the Cold War. Everything was razor focused on Europe, at least publicly. People were hearing all the highfalutin rhetoric about Europe, and you know, which makes sense to a large degree, given where the, you know, the border lines were drawn between the Soviets and the quote unquote, free world. But the, the sort of Asia as this backwater that was not terribly valuable, not really worth knowing history about, not really worth knowing the future about. In a way, even after the, not only the, the Pacific Theater, but also the Korean War, and then also the Vietnam War, even after that, the hottest wars of the Cold War, it still retained that irrelevance, that irrelevant quality to American audiences is, well, as a, even if I'm anti-war, I don't really need to know a lot about what this place is. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, I think the most people forget the period of depression after Vietnam, like, you know, people talk about how Vietnam became cool, and there were movies about Vietnam. You know, we went back and did the dates on those movies, and there's a real delay. It takes a long time to come up with a way to make Vietnam cool. It just seemed, you know, living through it. It was like, God looks hot, and you can get killed, and nobody will have any sense of what's going on there. It was just very depressing. Nobody wanted to know. Sure. Yeah. I guess one thing that, you know, is also kind of interesting that, you know, sort of, I think the difference between how people, the way in which Brennan's describing that people are able to kind of tune out and not feel invested in these wars. And yet, we live in a, a total war economy and society, you know, like the military industrial complex. We don't have industrial policy because they set it. And because they are like their policy interests at, like, it's the determinant factor. You know, obviously, and not like a, like, it's, you know, in relationship and in concert with many other things, but the degree to which, you know, the effectiveness of, you know, our elite, and, you know, our media at helping people disaggregate those two things that like, yeah, we have, like, a million cops and no healthcare for a reason. And that's directly connected to, you know, the fact that we also have like a Brazilian, you know, policeman, so to speak all over the world, where people, you know, subcontracting our violence for us because we're the, you know, because we're the financial power, et cetera. And Americans, obviously, as you guys well know, they don't know anything about other people's history, let alone their own, or rather, reverse that. But I mean, if there was one place in the world to, to, to not correct that in this century, boy, did we, did we bungle that one, not having even a slight adjustment of, of knowledge or public sort of awareness or basic historical intuition about Asia because this is the wrong century, not, you know, up on that stuff because Europe, Europe is in the backseat now. So another good move there. Yeah, well, so let's, let's get to the war. I mean, yeah. One of the first things you guys point out is there is a popular notion of the Korean War and how it started. Basically, crazy North Korean commies invade completely out of the blue. Right. Peaceful, just trying to get its, you know, trying to get its bootstraps up and elbows greased up for, for work South Korea, shocking everyone because they're commies and that's what commies do with Stalin, egging them on in the background or, or, or pushing them into it and maybe Mao. I mean, there's, you know, there's so many elements here. It's why I'm really having done a lot of shows, John and I, like, it's very impressive that you're able to take material that goes in a lot of really important directions then and now and are able to construct narratives that are that are fun to listen to. I mean, I was thinking about fun and I mean, you also learn a lot, but it's fun to listen to it with and as you said, you know, you tell stories about characters too. We're going to get to MacArthur who is the ultimate character. Yes. Yeah. Some would say the greatest. The Liberace of the, the Liberace of the Korean is now home. Like that's that's how he is. That's what he's to me. I'm sure that's how MacArthur wanted to be remembered as well. Yes. I want to take it. Totally. Maybe so. Shades and a call. We shall return to MacArthur. Oh, sorry. I had to do it. I had to do it. Thank you. Thank you. I'm a pro. All right. So, so if you could give like the quick lowdown like what the story we're told is about the Korean War and I know this is a big one, but you know, and what really actually went on. Sure. I think the canned history you started to sum it up there, you know, perfectly is that it out of nowhere on in June of 1950 and what was supposed to be peacetime. The North Koreans who were communist under the direct leadership of Joseph Stalin, the North Korean puppet state. This is the canned history. Invaded South Korea, which was a U.S. supported fledgling democracy. And almost overrun the peninsula and put it under Soviet control for reasons that are not terribly clear in this telling why that would happen the way we've just introduced it. And the United States, given, you know, this new era in which, you know, it's important to have international norms and not let aggression happen again and not let borders be crossed that shouldn't be crossed similar to the way that the Axis powers had just ravaged the world. We had to intervene in a police action with the humanitarian intervention of the UN. So we were really, it wasn't even really the Americans so much as the world community that did it. And that's why the war had to happen. And then past that point, depending on your politics, if you're more liberal, you might say, and then we went too far, you know, crazy McCartes, they're pushed just too far, but it was originally a good policy. Or you maybe say the whole thing to the very end of the war was justified if it weren't for those communists, et cetera. That's the canned history. Not a lot of explanatory power there if you're, you know, interested in it. But what I think we try to break down in the show, and of course, the whole point of the show is that this takes a little bit longer to answer. But I think a good starting place without going even too far back in history before the war is that by well before June 1950, at least 100,000 people had been slaughtered in the South of Korea. So that's odd. We're saying that the Korean war starts in June 1950 where 100,000 people were already dead. What kind of sense does that make? And so you begin to look at, well, what was the nature of that government in the South that slaughtered 100,000 people? Wasn't the North? In the North, they're really actually, especially compared to the Chinese Revolution or the Vietnamese Revolution, there was very little violence altogether. There was the same type of policies of land redistribution and, you know, a kind of tightening of the ship of state. But those who wanted, didn't want to be a part of it, they just fled and they left. In that way, the partition of the country sort of worked out for the revolution in the North. And they just went to the South where the policies were precisely flipped and it was a minority in control of the government that the majority of the population didn't like. And so that is, in fact, why people were slaughtered? Because the people in charge in the South were largely collaborators with Japan, that the United States military government collaborated with upon taking control because there was a US occupation, military occupation. And it was a brutal police state run by a bunch of kleptocrats. The only one who wasn't a collaborator with Japan was Shingman Rhee, the presumed president. By the time we left, in 1948, he was president. And even he was a pretty, a pretty undemocratic guy and he was no different as far as any conception of a dictator than anyone else. And so there was a civil war already happening and that you could argue it went back even before then. And that is really, I think, the easiest way to put it is that, and the preeminent English language historian of the war, Bruce Cummings, we were lucky enough to get on the show and he's incredibly useful and did all the scholarship, you know, long before, no one, I were even born, as to thinking about this very differently from the official history, which was, you know, aside from the convenient start date we like to put on it of June 1950, which has all this spring out of nowhere, that there was a truly inter-Korean conflict in which you had, generally speaking, a progressive communist force that was, had good credentials from World War II and whose policies were broadly popular, coming up against a US supported and previously Japanese supported cohort that were standing in the way of all that type of stuff, of redistribution of land, women's rights, labor rights, and this was a bloody conflict between Koreans that we intervened on in order to preserve a anti-communist regime in the South. And that is when what could have been a war that was wrapped up and certainly bloody between North and South in the year of 1950, maybe 1951, becomes a conflict in which millions die over the next three years and really beyond that into the current day because of the way that, you know, what you would pretty classically describe as an imperialist invasion to prop up one side against the other. And it turns this thing into something totally different. You know, and to emphasize totally different, I think that there's a totally different kind of language and almost like moral architecture that has developed, had been developed, rather, to address the question of North Korea. Like, you know, this conflict with its millions dead, with the, you know, wild and far-reaching, like human rights, like the Iraq war is famous, right, for, you know, like, yes, there was, you know, white phosphorus and fulusia shore, and then there was, you know, tortured Abu Ghraib. Like, the Korean War was just, you know, it's just, it is incomprehensibly more brutal and more sophisticated and systematic in its brutality. And North Korea's current system, this caricature of what it is, you know, is, is, is in large part developed quite transparently to counteract that- That ever happening again. Exactly. Like, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and it's also, I think, like, it, you know, there's a lot in the story where it's like, okay, you know, the canned history is also that North Korea is just like poor and desperate country, which like, yes, these days true. However, that wasn't always the case. There was a time when North Korea was, you know, significantly far ahead, you know, further ahead than the South, you know, sending food aid to the South. And then, with the fall of the Soviet Union, and, you know, the broader series of transformations that seem to happen in socialist countries from the late 70s onward, you see, you know, in the case of, you know, like, the, you know, I mean, it's hard for me to see what's all the different from the Kim family in, in Korea, and necessarily all the different from say some of the families running party bureaucracies in, you know, Baltic states or something, you know, or Japan and South Korea. Exactly. Like, you know, there's just like this, you know, like, like, we just create exception after exception after exception, you know, culminating in the mother of all exceptions, you know, about what makes North Korea special, which is like, you know, like, like, like, cornering, you know, like, cornering, like, truly cornering them, like, you know, beyond the point, like, like, indisputably into this like, ridiculous, insane nuclear standoff. But, but yeah, I mean, to answer your first question with a lot of stuff, Denmark. It's, it's, it's this, it's this initial moment in which a civil war between Koreans is put through the, the dark side of the moon prison into being translated on the other end as a cold war, Soviet sneak attack. Yeah. And therefore, completely justifiable to intervene in for the sake of freedom in the South. And, you know, I mean, again, we've read a lot of different historians on this. You know, we certainly have a have a perspective that jails with some and not others. We weren't pretending to be totally objective. But the almost no one argue, I don't think anyone really argues that the, the, the, the body count of a Korean civil war and all countries are allowed their own conflicts to sort themselves out. What would have been, well, good, good, good, and serenely, you know, America had that moment that the, that the, that the body count would not have even approached what happened because the North almost did it. Even with the Americans in there, the North almost unified the entire peninsula. And that's what everyone wanted on both sides. Sigmund Rihwanda to unify it under his regime. But one of the reasons you could get locked up or tortured or killed in the South was if you were an agitant for Korean unification, on a, on a more equitable, you know, and I guess, you know, socialistic outlook. Because everyone wanted the, the 38th parallel to go away. That's, I guess, one other thing I would add is that the myth of the 38th parallel is this line that was somehow internationally recognized and drawn by, I don't know, the, the international community was about, you know, three years old as an American, as Dean Rusk, actually, who was at that point to another military bureaucrat or, Dean Rusk and a, a guy named Bonesteal. Charles Bonesteal. So, so that was a, that was really named Bonesteal. That was not on it. Wow. I know like a, like a military comic book name or something. You know, Bonesteal get in here. I think there's a, there's a Simpsons gag. There's a video game, the type of violent called Bonesteal or something like that. Bonesteal. That's Bonesteal. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Pretty close. So, so yeah, there was, I mean, I can testify that there, there was a real belief in a lot of people out there. And, you know, we were out there, if anybody was out there, that there were, those lines were real. Those were, that was what the globe map showed. You know, there was North Vietnam and South Vietnam. There was North Korea and South Vietnam South Korea. So, you began to think that, you know, there was, there was some sort of deep pattern in East Asian cultures. Well, I mean, it will not just East Asian. I mean, it's, you know, it's like one day there is India, the next day there is Indian Pakistan. Yeah. Like, you know, I mean, I think that or Germany, rather, yeah. I mean, like, there is, I mean, I, it's hopeful for me to always try and frame it. And I think like a previous more, imperialist forms than communist ones, because it really does seem that like, you know, the, you know, and this is the other dimension of the story, you know, that we talk about, to some extent, is that like the economic transformation that is, you know, that, you know, I think people more associate with an imperial project necessarily than they, you know, then, then with anti communism, I really should, which is that like the Korean war, then, you know, why does this happen? Why do we, you know, put our foot on the gas and this conflict and turn a civil war into, you know, a staging ground for genocide? It's in part because there is this like fantastic, you know, collision of interests of independent, in terms of like, you know, Soviet supporting Korean nationalism. And then Americans supporting Chiang Kai-Shiak in the various gangster states and, you know, business interests all around there. I mean, you literally had founders of the John, you know, founder of the John Birch Society, guy named Alfred Colberg, who was funding the magazine that is, you know, responsible for the first-ever blacklist in Hollywood of the McCarthy era. And that is, you know, to me, like it's, you know, it's sort of is a way of illustrating just how, how these, how war, especially, but, you know, especially the Korean war, you know, in this case, you know, was this, you know, this, was part of the, you know, this, this, this transform, just transformation of American society into this, you know, paranoid, brutal, militaristic thing. Yeah. Yeah, the Korean war was, and I guess we'll get to this again, but the Korean war, and you guys get into this, was really important in, in remaking, reordering America's, like, sort of political landscape and the economy, the political economy, I guess would be the word you'd use, like, and the state, like, and where, there are already people who wanted to remake the state, essentially into an imperial state with an imperial political economy to control, you know, our parts of the globe, but the war made it happen, the war made it possible to do that under an emergency. This is why, I mean, yeah, you know, one of many other things in the States. This too is part of the standard history, like, poor old Truman trying to do the FDR, do you militarize, and gosh, we almost lost because of that, so we can't ever, and I mean, ever, do you militarize again? Right. I mean, what's the, what's the, what's the, like, Warner, Mercury Games take on Truman? Cause like, one of the things Brennan and I found is that, like, fuck Truman, man. Yeah. I was so surprised that I have stone. You guys quoted, I have stone, speaking really well of him. And I like to me at a soft spot. You know what it is, man? I've just noticed this from my years in journalism. It's just don't, don't get close to your subjects. Don't hang out with them because they turn out to be people, and often, it might have been a really likable guy in person. So you become blinded, no matter, like I remember writing about Garicospada, for example, who's a fucking nut, right? But a fascinating dude. So then I hung out with him some. He once gave me a ride home from the airport. And I really liked the guy and I had a very hard time writing honestly about him after that for a long time. Yeah. Because you got to know him and you sort of feel sympathy. And you know, I mean, in some ways, it's almost better to have a semi caricature of the person because it's more accurate than your personal relationship with him. Yeah. Yeah. I think he was awful. Truman was fucking awful. And he was also kind of a dumb hazee. I mean, I actually find a lot of similarities between him and George W. Bush. Now obviously Bush is the Bush's kind of W was kind of the the fly transporter accident of Truman and J. K. Because he had the dynasty going for him. But he also had the kind of dull, dull, smoothed off intellect of Truman because in certain ways, not quite as cartoonish, but Atchison was making a lot of the chainy-like decisions for Truman during the war. And Truman did not have, he was a machine politician. So he wasn't like Bush in that way. But he was just kind of thrust into that position. I don't say that in a sympathetic way. I just mean that he was not particularly conniving because he didn't have the cleverness of a conniver. And when he goes up against MacArthur, which is the other through line of the season, you know, MacArthur plays him like a fiddle in so many different ways, which is very entertaining in its own way. But it actually comes down to these kind of two camps, I guess, to get into another concept here of an interruling class conflict in America, which you had the Truman's and the Atchisons, although they were very different, you know, personally and politically, they were the quote unquote moderate side, if you like, where they wanted a small, for them a small scale conflict. Just a few, you know, I think you said well in the podcast, right? It was, they wanted a Korean war, not World War Three. Yeah, they wanted a tidy, regional conflict to draw a line in the sand against the Soviets in their minds. And then MacArthur and back home, guys like McCarthy, they wanted a final showdown. It didn't matter that we were supposed to be in this new era of peacetime. And as far as the Soviets were concerned, very possibly a long-term period of collaboration, the way that had gone on during the Big Three era. And the MacArthur faction and the China lobby that were, you know, the Chen Kai-shek squad, they were quite interested in ending things with global communism once and for all, which was scary to Truman and scary to Atchison, because that meant, you know, getting those nukes back out and dusting them off only a couple years after Hiroshima. And that was a far greater escalation than even the very hawkish Truman was willing to accept. And so that was another thing that was being navigated in real time, which is why, of course, at the end of the day, there was a standoff between Truman and MacArthur because he was going over Truman's head. He was running the war without any approval from Washington. It's amazing. But Truman, I mean, the thing, look, Truman, it's, he's one of those politicians, I think that you could say was sort of useful, useful to different factions of the ruling elites, the American elites. And like, a lot more useful than Roosevelt, who came from the elites, and so he had a will of his own and a vision of his own. Right. And then to, you know, to that point, like Martin, the late Martin Sherwin, who is a greatest historian who we interviewed in season two, he makes a lot of like really, you know, kind of amazing because his book on Hiroshima, world destroyed and like the decision to drop the bombs. When, when FDR died, like, he held all of his cards so close to his chest that, you know, things like the bombs, like basically Truman has, you know, he spent months like telling people, like, oh, whoa, why do I have to like meetings that he will sign? It's in the record where he's like, oh, why do I have to be the one to do this? Nobody's ever been as unlucky as, as area's Truman. Like, I mean, it's, it's, it's almost like a boy. It's so pathetic. It's almost like, oh, man. Yeah. I mean, I didn't literally result in like the worst human horror ever. Exactly. I think I would feel more sympathetic, but always me, I'm suffering so much. I have to press the button. No, no one's going through it. I'm going through. I just pressed it. Yeah. It's, uh, he's, he's gross. I mean, look, he unleashed the red scare, the second red scare, as you'd call it, right? Yes. Yes. Yes. And, and this is, I mean, among other things, it's sort of, uh, it was his, I don't know, it's hard to say how sentient it was or conscious of things, but this was his way of, of, um, breaking off with, with FDR and, and at least the left part of the New Deal coalition. Yeah. Like in a hard way, any, any killed labor through that, like he was, I know labor, at least the left part of labor, like we'll never forgive him for that. And, I mean, that's, and, and, and that's something that we do really try to kind of talk about in, in the season, you know, to some extent, like, you know, it's really kind of hard to, and I think over or over sell the degree to which anti-communism as like a, as like, you know, this like world historical force that, you know, goes on to, you know, sort of, um, help capitalism take root in the fashion that it does over the course of, you know, in the ensuing years of the 20th century, there's just this, you know, like cascade of, you know, defeats and setbacks and, you know, just like the development of state authority being used to suppress these movements at home and abroad. And this is really, you know, like J. Edgar Hoover had, you know, I mean, these are his, you know, he, and, and these are his golden years. Uh, you know, these are his, you know, is when he is able to, you know, just by simply telling his guys to dress like Mormons, you know, introduce semblance of rule of law for the first time into communities across the country. And, you know, like that, you know, like, like, which is like a crazy thing to think about, and, you know, because of how corrupt local cops were and everything. And then, you know, what was that actually, you know, what was that in part of Trojan Horse 4? Oh, to make sure that, like minors and rural Illinois unionized and strike. So, you know, I mean, it's a real, like, you know, it's, it's this really like pervade. I mean, I think we're only really at the beginning of kind of fully processing it as, you know, a kind of explanation for why everything so fucked up or at least why everybody feels so messed up about it. There's a related military perception of the Cold War, which which I remember very well, which was it seemed and for good reason. This was not just a stereotype. There's a lot of truth behind it that the communist movements fought very well. And we're willing to fight and die even against much better armed enemies. And the people whose side we were supposed to be on didn't seem to fight very well. The South Korean army became a rather scary force later in its life in many different ways. But in the early stages of the Korean War, the general perception was, and I think this mainly, valid was that the South Korean armed forces had no will to fight. The North Korean forces had very strong will to fight. As did the North Vietnamese and via conforces and Vietnam. And this this was a really frustrating thing because people knew vaguely some of them anyway that these were people from the same ethnic group people speaking the same language. And how was how was that happening? So it ended. It couldn't be that this was what they wanted. They were voting with their rifles. So it had to be that there was some spell put on them by the word communism. I think we quote a couple American officials saying, why are our Koreans so shitty? Their Koreans are great. And we've already discussed the absolute, I mean, these are also like, we quote some accounts of very, you know, gentil vanilla, New York Times approved sources, in which you just understand that no one in the South liked that government. The North, the North government, you know, like any government around that time, it was certainly that some brutal measures were taken, et cetera, et cetera. But it was doing things that people liked that were popular. The South was not doing that. Yeah. Land reform, I mean, a taste of modern rights and labor and, you know, gender roles and things like this. And relatively, you know, agricultural and therefore, you know, sort of older and traditional society. And in the South, it was just, it was either you were collaborating with the former occupiers of Japan or the people who collaborated with them, or you were, and or you were scamming people and skimming a bunch of money out of the budget. So within the book, the bridge at Nogon Rhee, which is about one of the most infamous massacres that the US helped to help do in South Korea, or in the Korean war, they note that most people stayed home when the North was rolling down the peninsula. They didn't flee. There were certainly refugees. It's not to say there weren't. But most people did not flee in the South because they said, well, I don't care about this government. They're over, I just want the war to be over as soon as possible, which it almost was when they had driven everyone to the Busan perimeter at the southernmost tip of South Korea. Then the Americans get a second wind in MacArthur, you know, invades in China. So this is all to say, yes, the South Korean military at first, like many, many military, we have tried to prop up, would be at Afghanistan or Iraq, etc. They folded. That was in part because they were not particularly enthusiastic for their cause or for their government. But also on the military point, the shock troops of the North's you know, campaign, Southward were coming from Manchuria. They had just gotten back from the last bit of the Chinese civil war and the Korean they fought for mouths. They fought with Mao. As they constituted an outright majority of the CCP in Manchuria at one point, exactly 90% of the communist troops in Manchuria at one point earlier were Korean. I should say membership of the Communist Party in Manchuria. So these guys had been through, as had Kim Il Sung, which is why he had such an enormous prestige in North Korea and why we had to say that he was officially not Kim Il Sung. Our, our high policy to say that he was an imposter who had taken the identity like Don Draper or a principal skinner of the real. His real name was Armin Temzari. So we had said that, yeah, it was in, as Noah pointed out, in another interview, he was in the New York Times. It was in, you know, the, the, up the uppermost levels of high policy in South Korea and America. Anyway, Kim had fought in Manchuria and so had his crack troops who were leading the surge to unify Korea at the beginning of the, what we think of as the Korean war. They were way more battle tested and way more skilled than the South, than the Southern military. Right. I mean, so if we talk about our Koreans versus their Koreans, as they said, like, I mean, as they're Korean, their Korean leader, Kim Il Sung, well, we are only supposed to know him as a, as a totalitarian cult leader and without any grasp of his past. What was he doing during the war since Japan invaded China and Japan, of course, Korea was a colony of Japan at that time. He fought and what was Sigmund Rih doing during the war. He was drinking tea in Georgetown or something. I mean, what was he doing? Hey, he was doing some homework. He was doing some pretty tough essays. You know, Crunch, have you ever written a paper? Believe me, I sympathize with him, man. Man, you don't know what it's like. He was in the sh**. What I love about Sigmund Rih is that like theoretically, right? Like on paper, you know, right until he leaves, you know, he, he, you know, he should be like, you know, a classic like case of, like, yeah, here's like an American educated guy from the upper classes or who can, you know, represent them, who he literally studied under Woodrow Wilson, you know, years earlier. He's a internationalist, et cetera. And, you know, as soon as he gets to South Korea, what does he do? He like, you know, sets up a police state and, you know, begins like, you know, like going for as much guilt as he could possibly get. Classic Western train or pro-Western reformers, they call it, right? Western trained reformers. I was just about to bring up Chalibi in Iraq. I mean, he didn't get his high up as Sigmund Rih, but Chalibi was Mr. Human Rights and Mr., you know, Pinstripes. And then when he goes over there, he ends up in the in the block with Mokta Terrel Sauter in the Shia, you know, the Shia kind of militarists and Sigmund Rih, yeah. And, you know, Sigmund Rih is a fascinating guy because in the final episode, we go beyond the immediate period of the Korean war 50 through 53. And he holds on to power for another 10 years and becomes even more power hungry and pleptocratic. But he is also setting up the beginnings of what will become the powerhouse economy of Korea, of South Korea, because he's just absolutely ravaging that American teat of money that is, you know, free money, which the government will sort of streamline even more under the military dictatorships to create a state-led or a state capitalism that will eventually be incredibly victorious in, you know, basically by the 90s, which at that point it was South Korea was viewed as the wilderness. And the North was the one that was industrializing at break-dex speed and creating a better state of living. That was a surprise to me to learn that up through the early 80s, at least the North was, yeah, the North was by far the more developed in the up and developing. It comes out in strange ways. There's a memoir of someone who defected from North Korea. And I'm sure a lot of the grim stories in there are true enough. It's called, I think, the goldfish of Pyongyang. The aquarium? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's it. And as I recall, the guy says the family went north because things were better up there, you know, at that time. You could get more stuff. You could eat better. And it was pretty grim in the South. There was also another thing that might strike people as funny today, whether it's justified or not, is that a lot of intellectuals and writers and artists went to the North. And what's interesting because there was more freedom there to write stuff, not unlimited, but is there really ever unlimited freedom? It's another kind of slugin' hearing we do, but it was more than the South. You were very, very cautious to say anything in the South. There was literally the K CIA, eventually, the Korean CIA, that operated as efficiently as any idea of a Shazie state or whatever. And in fact, the DPRK's official insignia of the hammer and sickle has a pen in the middle because of the sort of, if you like, idiosyncratic, juj-e or North Korean innovations to classical Marxism about there's a bit more of an idealistic strain in it that talks about creating through your ideas and your literature and your culture, a really existing socialism. And so in those early years, well, in those decades, it was actually also common, not just for workers and peasants to pervert the North Korean situation, but for intellectuals and the kind of bougie writers as well. So let's talk about how the war actually starts. Well, again, I think at this point, and this is all really important to understand the North Korean regime today. What was going on between 47 and 50 in South Korea? I mean, the Jeju Island, we talked about that a bit with Tim Schorck many, many, many, many, many podcast years ago. But if you could remind, yeah, talk about that. And I didn't realize, I mean, how much constant sort of, because that border was seen as so artificial, it was just the 30th parallel was just kind of drawn there. How much sort of action was going on there anyway, right up to the end and how the South Koreans were constantly talking about how they're getting ready to invade the North and liberate the North. So if you could talk a bit about Jeju because it's pretty shocking and then, you know, and then like lead up to the war. Yeah. The years before the war, there were several things going on. One, which was on the, I mean, we call it a border because it's just, it's one of those limitations of language. But again, the 38th parallel was not a border such as there would be a border between Poland and Germany, you know, or a border between Iraq and Kuwait as Bruce Cummings put it. But there, but there was a some kind of line. And the South was the, according to US intelligence reports and US occupation reports the South kept violating the 30th parallel. And you know, there were pretty big clashes. I mean, these were clashes of hundreds of troops and dozens of people died every now and again as a result of these. And that was in the 40s, the late 40s. And as you pointed out, we go through a bit of a run, you know, at the end of one episode, just rattling off in the year or so before the war, quote unquote, started. Defense ministers, colonels, Sigmund Rihem self were announcing publicly and talking to English language. And of course, regional papers about how they are ready to finally roll back the North and take over the entire peninsula. The South is when people are saying, why haven't you already? They, the, the answer they give if they're asked is the Americans are telling us not to, but we want to. And so the Americans are waiting, perhaps for the right opportunity to give it a sheen of legitimacy. But that's all the South wants to do or this, the Southern leadership wants to do. The population also wants to unify, but not in the way that the government probably does. They won't allow elections, right? You guys keep reporting that that was the same with Vietnam. We wouldn't allow election like countrywide elections, even though that's what the UN plan was, because we knew that our guy would lose to the communists. So yeah, yeah. And in fact, even halfway through the war, when elections are being discussed as a part of a possible peace, you know, negotiation, it was still clear to the Americans that the communists would still win. They would still win the elections, even after all that it happened. And we didn't send a bunch of troops over there and a bunch of money over there just to lose to them in elections. So we had to keep the war going. But anyway, the, the, the border clashes were intense and frequent and they were usually coming from the South's initiative. Then you had, as you mentioned, Jeju Island, which you know, maybe you could talk about Jeju Island as a precursor to the war. Yeah, I mean, basically, there was, you know, like the, the line that we used in the show is that in like a hundred thousand people died in, in the surprising and Jeju Island, you know, a fairly, you know, which had been a, and part of the mainland, it was probably 60,000 on Jeju and then fair, fair, sorry. And, and, but there was a, a, a mass uprising, like a rural uprising from a population that was, I mean, it was, you know, like calling them, like, they were supposedly communist. I mean, Britain, how would you describe the affiliation? Like, because it was there were, they weren't like, particularly organized the mainland, but they did identify. Almost, almost no organized political right left wing force in the South was literally connected to the North. Yeah, that's part of why I wanted to like be careful about saying like communist. In later years, they, the war would, I would actually make them as these things, these things often go, the war would make them more connected to the North. Right. Especially on Jeju, especially on Jeju Island, they were really just a sort of common peasant. Was it like peasant? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. There's a lot of the Russian civil war. There were, I mean, even outside of the Bolsheviks and the peasant areas, they're all kinds of different peasant movements that are basically anti-land lord, land redistribution. And also, and, and, you know, again, we have to remember, so Jeju is off the coast of South Korea. I want to say it's sort of like between Japan and South Korea. Right. So I mean, this is dissolved tide to anti-colonialism. And it's very, you know, to me, the, like the Jeju Island opera, I mean, it's ultimately like an operation, Phoenix, almost kind of just like brutal scorched earth counterinsurgency campaign that's used to suppress them. And to, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's an event like the wave of suppression that sweeps across the country. But like in particular, the lore is at Jeju are, you know, to the extent that one wants to buy into the narrative that like the North Korean invasion, quote unquote, in July 1950, is the starting point of the conflict known as, you know, the Korean war, which you know, like it is in the sense that like one day there were newspaper headlines about it the other day there weren't, you know, to be glib. But like, you know, it was because the North saw in particular what was happening in Jeju and saw like, yeah, the Neo-Japan rulers or equivalents there about, you know, the Americans and their puppet, you know, like Vassals who are all, you know, former, you know, like, like, like members of the Japanese colonial ruling class, you know, they are like murdering our countrymen. And we've got to liberate and save them and unify our country. What's interesting is that the US military at first ignored Jeju. They didn't mind that they were practicing this communist way of organizing their island because they, they essentially, either they had other fish to fry or whatever. But once there was increasing protest on Jeju of keeping the two Koreas divided, of punishing the North and of not allowing full nationwide elections, which is what the US and its allies had imposed on all of Korea. They said that, oh, you'll have elections, but they'll be in the South and they'll apply to the whole peninsula, which is pretty much the exact opposite of what you think of as the, quote unquote, democracy line versus the communist line. Oh, and also, let's be clear. If there are to be elections anywhere and the government of Korea elects somebody who is at any point affiliated with communism or the party presently in control of the North, you know, then like, like America, USA goes bye bye. Bye bye. There was a law passed in the, I think February 48 or 49, where it literally became illegal in America for the, for our country to support a unified Korea because a unified Korea would have those people. I think a lot of people also now try to, like there's a new book by the historian, Nick Molder, that tries to, you know, more, he places like the history of economic warfare and sanctions in sort of like, you know, like a history that kind of ends in the 40s, but like to me, the contemporary thing, you know, that, like the more, the more important immediate precedent for how we think about like sanctions regimes against Korea in the present day or Iraq in the 90s or, you know, any number of the crazy, just like the like it's, I probably would have been able to name most of them, but now I couldn't even name, you know, like half of them, you know, just the number of countries that we engage these crazy, you know, like sophisticated programs of, you know, like technology, yeah. Exactly. Like financial power and muscle and so on. And in the case of Korea, like we have these sophisticated, you know, in part because of the so-called China lobby, which is, you know, kind of a misnomer given what these interests really represented and were after. But like, you know, in this case, yeah, they are aggressively shaping it to make sure that like these elect, like that if there were to be elections, they would have to be rump elections. And so to answer to finish the answer, their mark as far as what, what led to the outbreak of the war, you have this pretty significant prelude, if you want to call it that, in which there is already intense violence happening south of the 38th parallel that the north is, is, you know, fed up with and that indeed the southern population is fed up with. You have US imposed elections that no one, no, no popular collection of people in the south want. And you have unification off the table, despite the US having pledged that that was the ultimate goal along with the Soviets. The Soviets withdraw from their side of the occupation zone before the US does and the end of 48. And then the US does the same, although it leaves tons of people behind in a way that the Soviets do not. And then by actually when Mao is visiting the Soviet Union in late 1949 and early 1950 to finally meet with Stalin, that is around the time that Kim is looking for a green light or a, you know, a nod from the two largest communist states in order to unify his country. And he visits with both Mao and Stalin. I have a lot of fun going through this in the show because, you know, quite, quite against the idea we have of the communist world as a monolith at that time and Stalin dictating to everyone else what they should do was, it was very different. Not only were they not a monolith because while they ended up agreeing Mao was not too keen on the entire operation at that time, but for different reasons he couldn't very well tell Kim. Yeah, I just did a revolution to unify my country, but you can't do that with your public country. Yeah, with your help directly. Like there was basically no way for him to convincingly make that argument. But also Stalin really didn't want much to do with the Korean War at all. He wanted, he said, yeah, fine, go do that. But he said, I'm not going to give you any troops. I'm not going to, he even reneged on air support. So this was for a long time known as one American historian had labeled it Stalin's war and it really could not be further from the truth. Stalin was, I don't know, related to what we were talking about before that. In mid-20th century wars, the troops that were called communists, whether they actually were or not, fought better. And there had to be a reason for that that was emotionally acceptable. And it had to be that there was this massive yet insidious Soviet contribution that overmatched anything we could ever do, even if the numbers didn't work out that way. It just had to be true that way. It's sort of like Trump couldn't have beat Hillary, but Putin backing Trump. He could beat Hillary. That's a real enemy. Yeah, it's always there. And honestly, who knows what Putin can do with black hammer behind him? And so then finally, Kim is planning to nip this stuff in the bud as is the South. But I think, I don't want to either spoil anything or hypothesize too much. But it seems that where you end up in June of 1950 is all of the noise coming from the South is very conspicuously as I have stone notes silenced. There is suddenly no more complaining about the North from South Korea. And there's no warning from the US, despite intelligence, that the North Koreans should watch what they do and not invade. There's no saber-addling from the South after all this time. Suddenly, that goes away. The North takes the plunge. There's some debate that is still ongoing about who exactly struck first that day. But it is clear from declassified Soviet archives that of course the North did have a campaign ready. And then they take soul within a couple days, within several days. And they actually seem either that they are not ready to keep moving or they didn't expect to necessarily keep soul or they wanted to get to soul and see if they could go for the whole peninsula and take the full monty. At any rate, this pause allows the United States to collect itself and whether we had planned on it the whole time or not or whether Chiang Kai-shek was a factor in this by the way, which Peter Dale Scott argues that it was either a massive perk or perhaps even a motivating factor to let this thing get as far along as it did to protect Chiang Kai-shek. Because one of the first things we do couldn't imagine in our relative day to say this. This is literally the day that Nancy Pelosi is landed in Taiwan. The first thing we do and the first thing that matters to Mao is not about anything in Korea, but we put US cruisers in the Taiwan Strait. And we effectively kill Mao's plan to finally unify all of China, including the Rump regime in Formosa, what was then called Formosa. We're not making sort of public sounds before the outbreak of the Korean War that we were not going to defend either Formosa or South Korea. I can't remember which one or both. I don't know. When there's some statements made to that effect, I've heard different. Sorry, statements of what that we would that we would not defend. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. It was there was cold feet basically at that point about really getting involved. And then next thing, you know, well, looks like we have this whole Korean situation there. So again, without knowing exactly what was the chicken or the egg, it certainly worked out well for the China lobby that we were suddenly militarily obliged, well, so we were told that we were military obliged to put to put the US Navy in between Mao and Taiwan. And in fact, that was what Mao, I mean, all of his hopes and dreams to, you know, get rid of the Chang dictatorship in Taiwan were then up in smoke. So he was not particularly enthused about about the Korean War, either before or after the US involvement, but then at a certain point with no place to go on Taiwan, he had to suddenly be, you know, prepared for MacArthur's March North, past the Yalu river, which was then, you know, acted upon a couple months later. Anyway, that's a that's kind of a short way to think about the pretext and the prelude to the war, the relatively quick and overwhelming victory of the North. And then the supply lines getting stretched a little bit too much, the North slowing down a little bit too much and allowing the US time to turn things around. And so then in September, you have the ancient landing where MacArthur, you know, rather, definitely begins a a pincer movement that drives the North. He gets behind their lines at the Western Port City and begins to drive the North, the Northern forces right back up the peninsula. And then things are really on their way. Right. I want to get to that in a minute. I want to go back to Stalin real quickly because the Stalin that and you guys are, I mean, you guys are mostly just reporting from, well, from scholarly works and cables and so on. But the Stalin that is presented in your accounts is a lot more was a lot more of a very familiar type of Soviet leader, which is generally cautious when you get far from your borders, wanting to hold on to what you have and not look into make this Soviet policy was summed up by Walter Subject. Yeah. What's mine is mine. Yeah. I mean, he's he's because in them in the minds of cold warriors, he's the puppeteer. I mean, you guys quote this a lot too. The Americans use this phrase imperialism, communist imperialism or Kremlin imperialism or Russian imperialism. It's really funny to hear that now in the context of the imperialism language wars on Twitter and, you know, anti-colonialism stuff. But I've read also I read a different book, a book by James Peck about the early sort of China policy. And all of these old national security directives, you know, they're sort of like, it's like a religious doctrine statement where they're constantly working on it, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And they use that language a lot. I mean, Atchison is very, very deliberate. Well, you guys quote Atchison a lot about, you know, we must refer to this as communist imperialism. It's so weird to think that, you know, they, I mean, they are trying to, it's like they're trying to convince themselves and then hoping to convince other people too. Yeah. How better to obscure what is really going on in an area that was directly an imperial holding of Japan that we have much like Vietnam and the French taken over and installed all the same people by saying, oh, no, no, no, you, no, you're the imperialist. I mean, that was the thinking behind not recognizing Mao. They kept saying, how could you fall for, you know, this puppet of Russian imperialism? And what they, they didn't want a grasp and probably didn't grasp either is that communism for a lot of these countries was a nationalist ideology. I mean, it went hand in hand. It wasn't for the Soviet Union, obviously, because it was the initial communist, were anti-nationalist, if anything. Sure. But it definitely was for these guys and it was, it was just, it was such a tin ear. And it's just funny to hear that now because we keep using that word and pretending not to be an empire. Throughout the 20th century, ideologies for insurgent movements went through certain fashions. And sometimes there was deep intellectual commitment behind them and sometimes there wasn't. It was clear after the Bolsheviks won against incredible odds in this very big, powerful country. That whole vocabulary acquired a lot of clout. And you would see it in places that are a little remembered today through the third quarter of the 20th century. And then, then ideologies start changing. People see it fading and they've not put new ideologies. And the connection, particularly at the time between any post-colonial state, it's desired for self-sufficiency and modernization and industrialization. You can see how it would couple quite well with Marxism at the time and socialism. But yes, especially in China, it was as much. And in fact, there's a great phrase of Mao's that we quote, I actually named one of the tracks on the soundtrack after it where he's meeting with Stalin and he says, we're going to have to hammer out an agreement that is both beautiful and tasty. That one. And beautiful in Mao's language meant ideas concerning revolutionary and international solidarity. And tasty meant matters pertaining to Chinese national interests. And you have to balance the beautiful with the tasty. And Mao was great at that. He was, he always had a phrase. Yeah, he had the talent. He had the talent. There's another, he was a poet. There was another great phrase that he uses. Or you know what, I'm not sure if it was Mao if it was another element of the Chinese leadership. But concerning the argument server-weather to intervene with the volunteers, so called in Korea, the Chinese volunteers, which was a way to not just flat out be a target by America as of going to war basically with America. The phrase was, we need to support Korea. It's being overrun by the imperialists by Americans. And when it was that when the lips, it's something like when the lips are bitten off, the teeth feel cold. So Korea is our neighbor. And it's right there. And we're not the same thing, but we're connected. And our teeth will feel cold, pretty, pretty damn cold, if we have the Americans hovering right over us in Korea. Which is I think also something that really is, you know, like an important component to giving lie to the idea of like any of these places even in like the present form about like the notions of like imperialism. Because it's like one, you know, like what do we do when like the dust cleared from this conflict? We just put a bunch of military bases over there. And there's no country with the comparable footprint on that score, let alone. But also I guess like to me, a part of what feels crazy is that, you know, there's this sense of, you know, camaraderie or, you know, maybe shared civilization or something, you could call it, you know, that exists there, that, you know, is their own response to. Whereas like literally, you know, it just sort of shows like, yeah, I guess America truly is a souther colonial state because all of our fucking neighbors, except for the other, you know, like white people country to our north hate us. Like and every reason. And I think, you know, our Latin America policy is there for everyone to see. But anyway, so yeah, this is a, this is like a really fastening moment where after the, after the Americans have turned things around, you have MacArthur either, and this is what's really fascinating to me and what's great in the I have Stonebook, people don't know it, it's called the Hidden History of the Korean War. It is fully based on contemporaneous, you know, just reporting that Stone is, I suppose the term in the blogging era would have been fiscing and just going through with the fine tooth comb and trying to make sense out of it. And the account he makes is pretty much on the money even though he was doing it as things were happening. But the Chinese are either clearly getting ready to interview, they're clearly getting ready to intervene. And MacArthur is either unaware of this or he bristic thinking they won't or as Stone, I think convincingly argues, he is pretending that they won't in order to guarantee a conflict. And whenever, whenever it appears as though there isn't a lot of action coming in the quote unquote, hards from China, the orcs from China aren't coming down the hill. He exaggerates that, that they are coming. And whenever they are there, he could be confused with with a traitorous pink Okami because he was covering up for them and saying that they weren't there. Because he wants to run into them by, you know, quote unquote, on surprise. And so then, you know, then we'll have another conflagration. And it's really amazing. That's a really good point. And when you look at what happened, I mean, first of all, three quarters of million troops from the PLA are massing pretty, pretty difficult to mass that number of troops, even in 1950 without being spotted somehow. And yeah, MacArthur has just pulled off the Inchon landing where you do the very effective thing, maybe the obvious thing, but you know, again, that's a tricky word. If you're fighting in a peninsula, you cut off, you go for the knees of the army that's advancing either up or down the peninsula and you break them further down than the front. He sent the Marines in particular into the famous Chosen Reservoir campaign way north through central North Korea in winter in the most absurd overregerable. Like, first of all, why do you have to take Chosen? There's nothing there. And if you're in China, troops, that's true. I mean, if he didn't think, if it didn't occur to him that, you know, they can do an Inchon too with their own methods, then right, I would be very surprised. I'm inclined to believe that that like it was sort of he had been kind of scurrying with disaster for a long time at various points in his career. And like, you know, he being like the head of the army and the Pacific theater was, you know, a pretty like awesome, you know, Guadalcanalist and brutal fighting and stuff, but like on the whole, there was a lot of opportunity for glory there. And then, you know, he gets into a strategically difficult situation and he believes, you know, he has, he believes that history is riding with him and that he will be allowed to take this word of the to China. You know, and courtesy of me in the strategic air command, you know, based on his accounts and theirs later. I mean, they would have dropped dozens of bombs and just basically, you know, I mean, their goal, like their plan, even, you know, it was, it was to just like escalate, escalate, escalate. So I think yeah, he didn't, he didn't foresee that one, the other, the opposing forces would be that much better and two that the, you know, the, the, the rest of the world might not want to go to nuclear war, especially considering, they've considered, you know, they had the opposite impression from, you know, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, that they were horrified. So I'm just building on on Brennan's point in thinking, maybe, you know, at this point, the, the tripwire theory of stationing a few soldiers somewhere dangerously far forward hadn't ossified to the degree I did later. And maybe it was like an anglerfish kind of tripwire, like, you know, let's, let's really dangle something out there and make them bite. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because what we've got is the big mouth anglerfish wise, this metaphor is not going to sustain itself much longer, which is called nukes because I, you know, for today's show I was looking up the, the dates, China doesn't do a first nuked test until 64. Yep. And the, the Soviet tests are in the early 50s. And it's a long way from a test to being able to vaporize DC within 10 minutes. So, and that was that, that, that, that, that nuke by the way, you know, test happens in the middle of the Korean War. So that was certainly utilized as a, as you say, even though that doesn't mean they can literally vaporize an American city, it's, it's immediately reported that way. Right. Right. But, yeah, but, but for the moment, in real military terms that, you know, MacArthur staff would have been dealing with, it's like, we are nukes. We invented nukes. Yeah. And it's a weapon in their heads. It's like, it's a weapon that's used it. Yeah. This is our advantage. And there were many points across the course of the war that although it never came to it, although I would argue that, and I think historians convincingly argue the destruction brought upon North Korea is equal to that of if you had just nuked the entire place. They just did it with conventional weapons similar to how the Dresden example was used in World War II is there's no reason you can't achieve a similar level of destruction. It just takes longer. And the nuclear option though was open the entire time. They were revisited several times under Truman and then under Eisenhower when he took over. And, you know, it was just a chance of history or a series of chances that meant it wasn't used, but it was by no means some kind of horrific off the table. Yeah. Option. And also, I think the other thing that's sort of like to the argument of why didn't we nuke if you're not choosing to argue it from that point of view. The thing that sort of Brennan raises for me that I'm not thinking about is, you know, there is also, you know, humming in the background of all this the Stragantic debate over reconversion from World War II. Because you have all of these munitions factory, in fact, you know, armaments people who have stocks from World War II that if they can't get around the world or programs in the pipeline, the things that they have to sell and get pie and so on. And Manhattan project is, it's a, you know, it's as the Eisenhower administration will find, you know, nuke's are a cheap deterrent relative, you know, for the government. But at that time, you know, that was money that would have been coming out of the most powerful, you know, the National Association of Manufacturers, the industrialists, the financiers, people whose money and investment had been tied up in the war economy and weren't ready to let it go. Yeah, and it spends a lot more tax money to do with rest and then to do a Hiroshima. Yep. So the competition within the industry is important to remember. And so yeah, we opted for the as Marge Simpson would say, I'm helping the economy. That's, that's, that that was our justification maybe at the end of the day for why we kept doing conventional warfare. But certainly it was justice horrific and, you know, we can talk about the levels of that in a bit if you want. But that I would say probably the most shocking thing for us. We've said this in another interview, but you know, we knew a bit about where we would go at the season and we knew the contours of the war and all that. But you really, I wouldn't advise reading an extensive amount about the human cost of the of the Korean War and the Nepal and the the level of destruction to the point where, you know, it drove the population of North Korea to live underground. They became mole people for a time in order to survive. And people ask why they want a nuclear deterrent all these years later. You know, right. Quick question about how this became a UN war. I mean, that was quite a feat by the US to make it a UN war. And it also created, as you guys talk about, it created this sort of hierarchy ambiguity that that MacArthur and the Americans, but also MacArthur was able to use. But how did this become because that didn't happen in other wars that America did. So America came up with other tricks. I mean, one thing you have to say about America as an empire, it's really good at the grim sort of legalistic, I don't know, legalistic ways of of loop pulling its way into wars without somehow holding itself accountable in the same way that it acts outraged at the way other countries behave. But so there was some kind of loophole here that they were able to take advantage of to make this a UN war and a police action, right? Yeah, that's one of the more interesting diplomatic sort of kerfuffles that we've covered in the three seasons so far because initially at the outset of the war, the Soviets were boycotting the UN Security Council because the UN would not recognize the now legitimate PRC, the new communist government of China. And that actually prevented, and there's debate over this, like did Stalin intentionally keep the boycott going when the Korean war was voted on in order to make sure the Americans got bogged down in one or did he make a mistake and would have done it differently and voted against or used his veto power if he could have or used the Soviet Union's veto power. Not sure, but then you had a certain point, the Soviets rejoined, even though the boycott did not achieve its aim of forcing the the body to recognize China. You had done a John Foster Delas who would become Secretary of State and was a Christian warrior from the earliest days of the war, the Cold War, and in fact visited South Korea just a few days before the war began and peered over the 38th parallel and was very involved in China policy as well as South Korean policy. He did a bunch of shenanigans at the UN to essentially circumvent the Security Council even when we couldn't get our way there by appealing to the General Assembly in which no one country could have a veto to achieve certain diplomatic victories. Apart from that, at the time, the UN was a much smaller body and it was a far more, it was an even easier body for the US to control and bully around. And so it was essentially a, you know, the US was first among equals as you could argue it still is if you like, in which it was very easy to simply put on a pageant at the UN, obviously even easier than it was in later years because Bush didn't even bother to get his second resolution in the Iraq war. You know, they actually did have trouble, you know, to the point where it was even more sort of embarrassing where they were claiming, when before we invaded Iraq that they had all the justification they needed from the first resolution. Back in these days, America could play the UN, you know, could, could, you know, play it like a Steinway and just basically use any policy that it desired, turn it into some kind of, you know, legitimate policy decided on either by the Security Council, which the Soviets had then left briefly or through the, or through the General Assembly and that was actually part of how we achieved some of the UN initiatives in South Korea about elections and stuff like that. So I guess what, you know, this was a period in which it was even easier for the US to manipulate the, what was then the new, you know, rubber stamp for any kind of international police action as Truman came to call the Korean war. Yeah, it reminds me a bit about how Putin calls the invasion of Ukraine a special operation. You're not allowed to call it a war. And we called, so we called this a police action. It was a police action in saying, yeah, police action in which, you know, we almost dropped like 50 nukes and what did MacArthur said he wanted to create a, at least a belt, a belt of cobalt radiation separating, right, the peninsula from from Manchuria, 60 miles wide. I remember a bit of this from Bruce Cummings, you know, so that no one would be able to cross, no Chinese person would be able to cross into the peninsula for like the next millennia or something. It was a weapon that was like six years old. Yeah, you know, there, things, there's been a sort of strange, I keep saying this, but it's very strange. I can't come up with an example in the past of a weapon that is of undoubted power and has been around for 75 years and has never been used since the initial use. And at the time, I think they were, I mean, the US and the in the cold war generally was by far the crazier, more aggressive power. And I think they were thinking, well, what do we do with this? Yeah. And it ended with maybe not. And you know, maybe that was more, more about profit than anything else because possibly there's a lot more profit in dropping conventional bolts. Yeah. And the, you know, by the time MacArthur is on the chopping block, they are actually not telling him about the nuclear payload that they're sending to go. Is it Guam now? Yeah, it's for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Because they're worried he's going to, he's going to truly, you know, uh, clean like it's in the world. And true is it. Yeah. The genius, true man, political genius is like, all right. And you know what? I'll fire the most popular man in America. But because I'm giving the A bomb to the generals, the Republicans will be cool about it. Yeah. And who did he give it to again? Curtis. He puts a charge of it. Yeah. Yeah. Lamellis bombs away. Lamellis. I mean, yeah. There you go. It's in the nickname. George Wallace is running made in 1968. I mean, yeah, that's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, this accumulation of detail that makes anything like it really is a fucking miracle that like humans are here at all to tell this story. I know. Yes. You really get that. What's interesting about Lamellis just to just to close out on that is that he and MacArthur essentially had the same rationale, which I think is is I'm not, of course, I'm not going to say I agree with it on a, on a, on a basic level. But if you are going to do this, their argument was I said, this is a quote from Lamell paraphrased. He, he said, I wanted to go in early on in the war and just completely vaporize a couple North Korean towns, send a message, whatever, brutal and humane, obviously. Shouldn't, shouldn't even be asking these questions. But that he, that's his job. He says that. And he says they, they didn't want to do that. They said it would be too, too horrific. You know, we, it's too terrible. And so he says, three years later, we have vaporized every city of town in North Korea period. And he's correct. There was a destruction, a rate of destruction of every city or town of from 40 to 90%. So, I mean, which is inconceivable. I mean, it's literally inconceivable. You might as well just not even try to imagine what it's like to see your entire country gone. So he, his, his argument, which I don't think is, um, uh, terribly more absurd than Truman's argument was, look, do you want to get this over with quick and brutally? Or do you want to drag this out more slowly and gradually, but 10 times more brutally at the end of the day. And so that was, that was the argument happening. It wasn't no war or war. It was, which of these two options do we want to do? And so, LeMay and MacArthur thought they were humanitarian. And when Truman gets voted out, who's the other argument, you know, who gets to come into power? Like, you know, this is, you know, this is also sort of reveals like the problem of our, you know, like, I mean, if one were to be a live liberal, kind of, you know, somebody who believes that there's any way of sort of correcting the system, then, you know, it's like, great. Yeah. Like the, the, all of the authors of this future and all of this is done. Um, I mean, I, I guess to me, what's just like so jarring about it is the, um, like, you know, the only other option when a Democrat goes, you know, this crazy, like Truman did is, is like, and then we bring in Eisenhower and the dullises and, you know, we, like, do, you know, we, we align instead of this trajectory for things just to get worse and worse and worse. And it was all under, you know, it was a, it was a, it was a liberal who, who did it proud, yeah, excitedly. Yeah. Yeah. That's the thing about the 20th century is, is, is, is always getting worse. Well, yeah. So I think the, uh, I think, you know, back in the day of on the right, whether it's the bircher right or even like the more mainstream Republican right, it was, there was the idea of Democrat wars, you know, from that kind of isolationist, whether you were genuinely isolations, it was Democrat wars, always getting us into war. And it's not, it's not wrong on the record. I mean, of course, it's, it's disingenuous in many ways. But, but, but like, because, because a lot of these guys who called themselves isolationists did support the war in Korea, although it's interesting. And the very outset of the war, um, in the early hours, there was a Democrat and a Republican, their names are escaping me, but they weren't, they weren't huge personalities at the time. Both of whom said the thesis, we laid out that's from the kind of, you know, um, coming's, you know, revisionist school, which is, is this just a civil war between countrymen? And they were immediately drowned out. There was one Republican who said it and one Democrat who said it, but the, the apostasy as the, um, the writer Steve Casey wrote a book called Selling the Korean War. The apostasy was stamped out almost immediately. And there was no debate on that whatsoever. It was uniformly, well, after them, uniformly presented as a Soviet puppet. Yes. Uh, war. Right. I think after 1939, say everybody lost their mind as far as that went. It was like everything was going to be an analogy to something else. Until today, until today. Yeah. Yeah. It's always 1938 today. It's always 1938. Yeah. Yeah. I was surprised also to read about so getting, getting back to Stalin too that are, are you listening guys talk about how, um, US jets, uh, and this was the first war I think fought with jets, um, with, I mean, where the Air Force had jet fighters and stuff. Where they, they went deep into Soviet territory and strafed airfield, Soviet airfields. I mean, there's clearly an attempt to provoke going on here. Oh, and, and this is also like, it's, you know, we, we're, we're, we're, we're limited to sort of telling the story about the Korean war, but it's like, it is important for them. I think they'll, you know, listen to imagine their events like this going on all the time. Like Stalin is not just being confronted with like strafing over an airfield, you know, or in, in, in, you know, some like, you know, far off like, oh, blaster, whatever. And, you know, who knows where he's dealing with that plus the fact that like, I don't know, like something is going on, you know, in the Baltic. So there's a constant wave of problems. Right. Right. And, uh, stone, stone notes that if the Chinese later on, because we also hit across it, the, the, the minchurian border or near it. Um, if the Chinese or the Soviets, if they were a little less cool headed, there could have been World War Three right then and there. I mean, I don't know how else to really perceive those events as, as anything but a provocation given they repeated, uh, you know, the fact that they happen repeatedly because what you would expect another proud, you know, large country to do is hit back and, and at least escalate and, I mean, say whatever you want, uh, we're a little bit softer on, on, on these guys than most other American, uh, you know, histories. They, they kept their heads and did not even try to escalate it. Um, let alone escalate it, especially in the, the SCREEN context, which isn't incredibly smart. And it's why I think we're seeing that to get, I mean, I don't want to eat my words, but it seems as though today with Pelosi's visits to Taiwan, and completely unness, this is diplomatic, of course, the Korean War was even hotter because it was literal bombs. But even if you look at the diplomatic, which is sometimes just as important, if you look at the diplomatic maneuver that we're still doing today, Pelosi has zero reason to obviously be in Taiwan. Even some Taiwanese politicians are boning her visit. It's crashing the Taiwanese dollar. Um, it's, it's some, you know, it's some weird, we'll learn about it in five years or whatever. It's some weird Biden administration, you know, maneuver to test the waters and, yeah. And probably, and probably cause an escalation in order to, in order to justify further spending here and blah, blah, blah. But the Chinese aren't going to blow her up because, you know, unlike, say, you know, President Xi, you know, coming here to meet with the Black Hammer organization is no joke to bet earlier. You know, we, you know, we would, we would probably be far more aggressive to a Chinese official or, or almost, you know, near head of state figure coming over and, or Putin or whatever, you know, coming over here and, and shaking hands with, I don't know, you know, the Maduro or something. Can you imagine the way we'd be, we'd be talking about that. They're not even trying anything like that. And then when Pelosi does it over there, to then throw it back to this logic of the Korean War, China and the USSR, similarly, they thought, this is just, this is, we're going to have to eat the Humble Pie. You know, we're just going to have to have a concrete mixer of Humble Pie here for the next three years because ultimately, this is going to be their bloody war and not ours. Well, I suppose the Soviets were saying that the Chinese actually got involved. But came out, came out with a lot of blood, but, but ultimately intact. And I guess we should also mention to, to maybe explain a, just a bite-size way why China got involved at all is obviously from a national security perspective, the, the tasty part. Obviously, the lips of the T and the lips in the teeth because, because there was also rumor-mongering happening still at the end of the Chinese Civil War, not all of China was completely brought under the, the government yet. There was a third of China in, I believe, October when Mao declared the existence of the People's Republic of China. There was still a third of the country that wasn't actually like locked, locked in yet. And so there was some mopping up to do. By the time Changs and, is in Formosa and, and really setting up his long stay there, pretty much it was Formosa and Tibet that were outliers. But, um, there was still not a really existing situation, but a, almost just as bad, a rumor-mongering of how the West was about to invade and how the Chang was coming back. He, I just heard that he's coming back with the American army and blah, blah, blah, and it was causing, you know, incredible, you know, destabilizing waves that were just as deadly for a nascent government to suddenly be overthrown by people going, oh, shit, it's going the other way again. You know, and so there was a lot reason for the, you know, Chinese government to put everything they could into a policy of, you know, locking down their borders, locking down the permanency of the government, not allowing Americans to set up shop right over their borders in Manchuria, you know, because this was a very, very sensitive time for them. And so you start to see, even though they really highly debated it, there was a lot of debate over several months between high ranking members of the PLA and the PRC or rather the CCP that eventually Mao himself was torn, but said, I think we have to do this for all the reasons just stated. It was not a kind of knee-jerk reaction. So, you know, both of the Communist powers were quite cautious in their approach, even the one that intervened. I mean, there's so much more in your episode on the Korean War on your shows, on the Korean War, that is what season three of Blowback. I mean, here, I didn't realize we've already talked almost two hours. And we sort of barely scratched the surface of all the things you guys get into. Plus, you have deep-died bonuses. I mean, we haven't even talked about the insane, you know, biological warfare potentially. And of course, brainwashing, mentoring, candidate. I mean, the whole brainwashing freak out comes from the Korean War and the POWs. And then the CIA does it for reals on Americans. You know, oh, the Chinese outdoers there. They had to do it. I mean, they had to do it because the Chinese were going to do it, even if they didn't. They had to close the brainwashing. Yeah. On the positive side of the ledger, we have to give some credit to the Korean War for PKD and the false memories and implanted. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. I love my false memories. Where would I be without them? Am I you? Are you me? Any rest of us? I get you as to moss. Yeah. I just have to ask you real quick. Did you guys see, did you have you watched very many Korean? Well, there aren't, look, there aren't a lot of Korean war novels or and there's not a lot of Korean war movies. Although with Koreans are are and you know, the way you guys frame the Korean War as a civil war, the US intervened in is how that seems to be from the Korean War movies I've seen. That's how they frame it. Usually. It's a, like brothers. I mean, what's that movie called? Brothers and sisters. It's a Danish. I think it's it's good. Or are you mean the, you mean a Korean movie? The really bloody Korean War movie. Yeah. Was it blood brothers or something? I think it's called the brotherhood of war. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it was in the early 2000s. Yes. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's a, there's an episode I won't say it touches on all of this, but there's a bonus episode. The first one is with a filmmaker and an a Brunowski who made a film in Korea or in North Korea a couple years ago in order to make a effective propaganda to learn how to make an effective North Korean style propaganda film in Australia against fracking. And it's called aim high in creation. And she kind of, it's very tongue in cheek, but my interview with her I actually think gets to some very, you know, sort of places of pathos about her having genuinely been to North Korea. Several times met North Koreans. Try to make a film that isn't just treating them like a plague, but you know, apart from a nation of film audiences, also a nation of human beings. And in that episode, we talk a bit about North Korean film in particular and the golden age of North Korean film because there was a time in which they did joint productions with European, you know, film companies and it wasn't as closed off a country as it is now, et cetera. But there's tons of great Korean movies. I, you know, like many others enjoy the South Korean horror movies. They really have a great horror movie industry there, which is I'm sure not uninformed by some of the history we've been discussing. But there's lots of great spy movies. You know, I'm not, of course, glad that there's an ongoing partition of the country, but it does lead to them dealing with it culturally and in their storytelling with some interesting spy movies and on both sides of North and South. Great, great cinema. And so, you know, and then the, you know, the Battle of Lake Changshin last year was a bit, what I think after Spider-Man, the latest Spider-Man, Slok was the biggest, was the best-selling, you know, movie of all time because of its success in China, which is about the battle we were discussing in the Korean War. So, or one of them. So, you know, there's an immense cultural footprint in Asia of this war, ironically, pretty much none here in America. So, if people, you can honestly find a lot of great Korean movies on YouTube, North and South. So, you know, if you like jump on Letterbox and just search like North Korean Cinema, South Korean Cinema, that better than I could list stuff off here. You'll get titles. And if you just punch those titles into YouTube, there's such a great amount of filmmaking, some directly about the war. So, it's great. I mean, here we are today. There's still a North Korean South Korea. There's still, there hasn't been a peace deal. Every few years, we're on the verge of a nuclear war with them. You know, that all started in the Clinton years, actually. So, the whole thing where we might have to nuke them before they knew us. We thought so weird because... So weird because... Ten. Right. And it's so weird because John, correct me if I'm wrong, but like in the... Okay, when I was a kid, so the 70s and 80s, Korea, it was just a bad, it was sort of like a bad memory, different from Vietnam. But it was just, you didn't want to think about that problem. And I don't remember it was... It was not a front and center enemy like it became a dead... Not at all. As far as the mainstream opinion was concerned, it had been solved. To the extent that South Korea contributed some very scary troops to Vietnam. Right. Right. Exactly. So it was kind of weird that it got resurrected. But of course, you know, as Powell said, they needed a villain again. A rogue state. Yes, a rogue state. Right. Rogue states. Yeah. That it got resurrected like that. And so, you know, but I mean, for example, had they reunified if you want to take an analogy again, you know, look at Vietnam. I mean, we left Vietnam after all that destruction, all the deaths, all the damage to their culture, to American culture. And it reunited. And there nothing happened. Like they didn't chase us back here and kill us here. They didn't... Nothing happened, you know? And you got to assume that's probably what would have happened if we had not intervened in that civil war. Like instead, a bunch of millions had to die. One of the more obvious tragedies is how this thing infected every player of the... In the war. I mean, I suppose really the party most involved... Or one of the involved parties that was least affected was the USSR. But otherwise, I mean, China lost a lot of people in it and had to deal with a new lingering threat. Obviously, most of all, North Korea was pulverized and lived ever after is a very, you know, I think justifiably paranoid garrison state. And South Korea was a US neocolonny that remains not in control of its own destiny because we control their military. And we, we, you know, I think they've been an impressive case of hyper capitalism, but that doesn't tend to last very long. Once you've created a baseline, you know, floor for, I guess, your standard of living. They're still struggling for, you know, everything from a democratic system, a functioning democratic system to an economy that doesn't, you know, exist on sweatshop labor. In equality, there is equality. Yeah. I mean, my book Going Postal was translated there and I talked to the translators. Like, it's because everything you talk about, the inequality is so much worse. And even, hey, I mean, if you want to just even be topical still, Shenzhou Abe got, got, got domed by, or I guess he got blown away in the chest by a guy who was pissed off about a creation of the Korean CIA, which is the Unification Church, which was made just as several, you know, several pseudo cultural institutions were created by the CIA. The Unification Church was made between, it was a deal between the reverence, Sang-Mong-Moon and the intelligence masters of South Korea. And there's continuing echoes of that handshake today and other. Can I be a pro here and say that that's blowback? Which happens to be the name of your podcast. Oh, yeah. But yeah, so I mean, and, you know, and blowbacks is kind of a tongue-in-cheek title in some ways, because we also want to, you know, sometimes see how things are not in fact an accident. But yeah, there is also real blowback. And I think that this is, you know, one of those stories that we were lucky to be able to draw on a lot of amazing historical and hardworking researchers and scholars and people who have been there, who we interview in the show. We also got to interview them. So if you're not particularly impressed with our voices or personalities, still listen to the show because we are informed and then sometimes talking to some of the sharpest people on this stuff as we have been today. So thanks for having us. Great. Well, thank you guys both. Yeah, this has been awesome, like an amazing conversation. Brendan James and Noah Cohen of blowback. No, I see you that does that amazing Israeli imitation of these really accident. They're on Turean on. Was that you? Oh, yeah, I mean, yeah, I love it. It's a, it was a, we listen. Yeah, there was a time in my life where I lived in is in I was living in the Israel. It's, it's never leave you. Like the, like, the, the, the, or, in far, in Israel. It's, you know, part of Jewish history. I don't know. I wish we could have done an Israel South Korean or Korean war thing, but I couldn't think of it. God. Well, Noah, you should, I've been seeing in like ads that are whatever. I don't, I can't imagine they're targeted at me, but maybe they are for tourism to Israel and you should get it on some of the world. Because if you do that, listen, come to Israel. We'll give you gun. You can see what the apartheid looks like. And you can't leave. That's the thing. You have to take a Palestinian so many. You can't leave. All right. That's great. Well, again, great show. Blowback season three, Korea, but also when you subscribe, you get season one, season two and all kinds of bonus episodes and music and everything. So again, really appreciate you guys coming on. Talking with us. Thank you very much. Thanks, Charlie. Thanks, Mark. Thanks guys. Thank you. All right. Bye. Bye.",
