    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. Today is February 19th, 2023 and this is episode 368. I'm here in Rochester, New York. It's not a laugh, it should be the easiest thing to remember which number it is and I'd say about half the time I'm off by one or two and I have to get reminded by Brendan. This is not 360. Anyway, I'm the Ghost Mark Ames, and you're listening to Radio Warner. Subscribe at patreon.com forward slash radio Warner. I'm on with the Warner line with Warner Gary Brett, aka John Dolan outside of Glasgow. How you doing, John? Pretty good. We're in Clydebank on the outskirts of Glasgow and we did a walk today along one of the many canals. I mean like your place, this is a canal landscape. There's those scots love their canals. They do. Yeah. Apparently, it's a big thing for the local adolescents to see how many shopping trolleys they can push into the canal and the local paper said that they did 50 on Friday night. The weird thing is there are these beautiful ducks, like ring neck ducks, common merg answers, swans, and they're swimming around with the half-sunken shopping carts and I don't know. They don't seem to mind. Yeah, nature's pretty adaptable in that grim way. Yeah. But that's good. At least they're not dropping dead from that and at least not from that. No, I mean, it's mostly good old metal. It's better than what that train is pumping out into Ohio, I suppose. Did you follow it? So people who sort of follow Scotland seem to take this news is pretty big deal. The resignation of the leader of the S&P the other day. But I don't know if you know any of the details, but I don't. I gather that it turned out she was kind of one of these sort of not really enthusiastic about being a nationalist nationalist or that's what I think people are more independent and client think and so they didn't seem to really, but I don't know. Or that she's got to have an American scandal. I know that the right people hate her guts. I mean, really hate her guts. And she seemed like a good person as far as I could tell. And she was trying to keep a party together in a way that involved getting whipped sawed by the overwhelmingly English and right wing English press and the tabloid press, the Daily Mail ran a non-stop hate campaign on her for years and years. And they managed to draw the party into a lot of very fraught fights about social issues that didn't really have anything to do with independence. And even though papers like the Daily Mail mock those issues all the time, they were useful as something to whipsaw her with. And I think it just wore her out eventually. But I have a very good impression over. Yeah, I mean, the English are good at that. I mean, the anti-Semitism slur against Corbin and Corbin followers, which is just the most counterintuitive thing imaginable. Unless you know, he's not even going to be allowed to run as a lady. Yeah, it's amazing. It just keeps going. And they're people. I mean, certainly the establishment media, all of the media except on the really left, they all just agree. Yeah, that happened. That's a real thing. And though it's been exposed 10 different ways as bullshit, it's amazing. And that thing still has juice in it. It's got it's weird. That's scary. I, you know, they seemed they were kind of trying to do that to Bernie. Ultimately, they didn't need to because he didn't get control of the party. And I personally don't think he really ultimately wanted it. He thought he thought Biden, his buddy Biden would do a good job. And that's that. Yeah. And I naively thought Bernie would be immune to the anti-Semitism charge because, you know, he's he's a Jew. And he's not only a Jew, but he's a lot more Jewish. It seems that any of the other Jews who were talking about him, but that didn't make any difference. They did. They tried. I'm just saying it didn't stick though. Yeah. But they definitely tried and threw it shamelessly through that others. If you believe that the LeCoud party and Mayor Cahun are Jewish, are what is Jewish, the only Jewish, then yeah, I guess any opposition to the extreme fascist right is anti-Jewish. You know, that's the only, that's the only like logic I can see about that. If you believe apartheid is Jewish and a good thing, then yeah, if you're against apartheid in Israel, you are anti-Semitic, I guess. Anyway, so we're going to try and take a stab at a very large difficult subject, which is carthage since John was there and we talked about it. At first we were sort of like, well, maybe we should do carthage, capital C and the Punic Wars. The more we kind of got into them, the more we realized that there's just too much to do there, I think, and probably too many people who know. I mean, maybe someday we'll get like one of our great either amateur or real historians or something to work with us on it, but there's just so much there. And what we wanted to talk about was something kind of somewhat more specific, solemn bow, really, solemn bow and the mercenary war, which means understanding carthage and means understanding the first Punic War. So that's what we're going to talk about. But before we do that. And when we also want to talk, I mean, I think one of the things we can do usefully is talk about how you make sense about a narrative that has already been set into orthodoxy, but when you look at it, it doesn't quite make sense. So we're not going to try to lay down the law about what really happened, but we would like to stir the ashes a little and see what's going on in there. Yeah. Before we get to that, I don't know, a couple of things we can talk about real quickly. One is your great newsletter, the first subscribers that just came out on Chihod, on Western Chihod, I guess, and Dune and Frank Herbert. I mean, it's a great, it's like if folks have been reading Warner columns and newsletters going back some years, like this is really just a classic example. The newsletters loved it. Yeah, it's great. And as was the Michael Pollock said, what is it with Northern California's SFF and House Boats drawn or something like that? Yeah, because Frank, Herbert and Jack Vance famously co-owned Houseboat and lived there with their families in the Delta, the Sacramento River Delta in the summers. Yeah, although, you know, Catherine, I didn't have a Houseboat. We had an actual boat boat. It didn't go anywhere because I never quite figured out how to get a diesel engine started from scratch. But, you know, it was an actual boat. But anyway, yeah, I think the lesson there is, if you are going to have a houseboat, have it in California in the summer, not in British Columbia in the winter. That would be a good start. But yeah, I wanted to do something about G-Hod because there's been a lot of articles excitedly saying, look at Frank Herbert. He anticipated Islamic State and that isn't quite the case. And I think by the benefit of being an old sci-fi fan from way back then, I can reconstruct a little about how remote the idea of G-Hod seems and how that remoteness had a part in the appeal the concept had for Herbert. I mean, I just would imagine most SFF, both especially writers actually, and fans, they also are fans of older kingdoms and wars. And you'd want to get, especially if you're getting into creative writing, you'd look for some epics that aren't, that your own culture is not entirely familiar with. It might have a little bit of familiarity with, but not entirely. So yeah. Absolutely. Especially because the nomenclature is so important. I mean, like in this newsletter, I said, okay, try coming up with invented planet and come up with a name for that planet. And you will be mortally embarrassed by how lame the invented names are. This was a feature of the first version of Star Trek. Oh, the planet, good lord. Yeah. I guess Philip Dick kind of got around that by making everything kind of grimly funny in a way or something, like almost blandly funny or something. Yeah, he was like using advertising line. Yeah, yeah. And we're slang from the business world of his times and just dropping it on imagined planets. You got to do something. And Herbert in Dune used Arabic and Turkish terms, but that led a lot of people, like including this one writer for Al Jazeera, who was understandably excited about this. But you got to say, that doesn't mean he really looked into the whole question of Islamic legalism and the concept of jihad. He, I mean, these guys are magpies. They just grab bright, shiny objects. They were writing pulp novels on what had to be a quick deadline because they didn't get any money for these things. Yeah, they had to write a lot of them with a lot of pages and put out several of them to get some kind of a steady income going. And the funny thing is, they still had glorious lives, you know, they had wonderful lives that were completely broke, which you could kind of do in those days. Yeah. And you could fail and still have second and third chances on many chances. In many, many, many. By the way, just got an email from previous radio-warnard guest, Terry Marnyak, saying how much he loved it. I forwarded to you. He asked if he could actually translate in a French and posted and he said, the whole text is brilliant, smart, extremely well written. And he said, could you let him know, impressed I am. And then he reminded me and I didn't know this about him. He said, I interviewed Jack Vance once. Good God. I know. And I said, wait a minute. You interviewed God? Yeah. Well, I do not know this. So I got to find out more about that. Hell yes. Please do. I mean, I know Terry's been publishing novel and getting written up in the big, you know, made like LaFigureau and the big major papers there. And he's kind of doing semi-sci-fi novels, kind of semi-druggy sci-fi novels that have gotten, it's gotten a lot bigger lately, which is cool. And yeah, and I know Skander Darkly, I think for his generation, that was, I think, it was, it was never my, I like Skander Darkly, but I have to say maybe because I heard, I already knew Dick before I read it. And I had heard so much about it. Someone I finally got to it. It was a bit of a letdown. Yeah. I went and read it again. I was like, okay, yeah, this is good. But like, I still don't, it's not the one that blew me away. Which is good. Now, there's one great thing in it. It has to me the best version of what a particular kind of evil person that, that I think we both knew from the Berkeley world, the kind of horrible brat who hit his peak in the SAT and never amounted to much after that and spends the rest of his life thinking of himself as a great intriguer and ruining as many lives around him as he can. Yeah. Yeah. Those people were legion at Berkeley actually. Yes. And there's one in scanner darkly. Unfortunately, when they tried to make a kind of animation movie out of it, I think Philip Seymour often played him and he played it fine. But the director didn't understand the character. He made him kind of cute or something and he is not cute. Yeah. The director did not understand the book or the, it's just somebody who thinks paranoia is interesting, there's no concept of it at all. Yeah, we'll briefly also before we move on. I actually posted something on this in the radio warner page, but yeah, I got these notifications through the two-step authentic, authenticator or whatever. First, it was like Tuesday or Wednesday, I got a notification that basically somebody was had hacked. It seems into my Gmail account. If I were to have responded to the authentication that would have confirmed and let them in. And then a day or two later, I got the same thing to my Facebook account. And it seems obvious. Yeah, I mean, you don't have to be a wild-eyed conspiracy theorist to connect the dot-reading Seymour Hirsch interview with that. Yeah, I mean, I guess they'd probably be trying to find something in criminating on Hirsch even. Although they don't like me, they're based on replies I get and replies on Twitter. I just assume there's so many people, freelancers, volunteers, people, I mean, this is one of the things that social media really brought out. It turns out that snitching is not hard to find snitches. There are people lining up around the block for miles begging dying to be a snitch, dying to turn somebody in on one side or the other. It's pretty awful. I don't know if every culture is that bad, but certainly this culture is. And I'm wondering about that because I mean, I like true crime novels and purely coincidentally, I came across two true crime novels which both involve somebody telling someone else, I'm with the CIA, will you help me kill someone? And both times they say, sure, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. So I mean, hopefully, I don't know. I don't know stuff about op-sec and that stuff. I'm getting some advice on what to do now. Apparently, it's very easy to get better op-sec. So apparently, I hopefully have that figured out. God knows what a drag it would be to have people, I don't know, scan through your emails. I don't really have anything incriminating, I don't think, but certainly embarrassing. I'm sure there's something there. Yeah. Well, I mean, if you don't have something embarrassing, you're not human. Yeah. Not a people working, I think. Yeah, that's true. But yeah, what else? So, you know, before we go on, I don't know, I'm not sure if we need to really say much about the latest in the Ukraine, Russia. Or I mean, we did, you know, we did the Seymour Hersch interview this month and that covered a lot of it. The only I would say, there's sort of a kind of a rolling debate going on about is Russia actually already in its big offensive. Did it start? Is it happening? Or is it yet to start? And this is all preparation. Whatever has started is not going very well, at least in Vuhiladar, even the nationalist, Russian nationalists are furious about basically another one of these situations where they just led their soldiers into a pretty easy kill zone, armor and soldiers. You know, they're making incremental gains in some other areas. But the big thing that happened was, I think Ben mentioned this when we talked to him, was that Putin replaced Sura Vika and who we brought in at the sort of naid era of the Russian war in Ukraine, what in the very beginning of October, I guess, of last year, after everything was won. And Sura Vika is clearly much more of a defensive mind, which is smart, quite frankly. Yeah. I mean, ideally, they would just end the war, but they're not doing that. But if we talk about just what would be smart, the smart thing would be to get defensive for quite a while, because they don't have much offensive juice. It's pretty clear. And Sura Vika stayed in long enough to basically shore things up and get all these mobilized conscripts, just trained up enough where their bodies can be used. They would make better defensive soldiers than offensive soldiers, as you pointed out many times. But it looks like they're being inserted to fill up gaps constantly. And Sura Vika was replaced, I don't know, a few weeks ago, a month or so ago, by the infamous General Grasimov, who has been probably responsible for all the other failures in the war before Sura Vika took over. He's back in and things aren't going that great. Again, I don't want to predict what it means. You can just say that things aren't going so great now, unless you think moving a couple city blocks in one area and getting mulled in another area is great. But you know, it's... One thing about reading about how long the first punic war went on, it's just over and it's not just that war, but many of them. They go into these wars just so sure that it's unimaginable that this thing can go on more than beyond my plan, which is like a month to three months out, maybe in that era, a year out. And then once they're in, what do they call it, the sunk cost theory or something, there's just no way to get out because they've already invested so much politically. I mean, it's sad to remember that Lincoln brought McClellan back. That was how little talent it seemed that there was in the Union command. He knew McClellan amounted to nothing, but then he tried Burnside and everybody knew Burnside was going to be a disaster and indeed Burnside was a disaster in very much the offensive way leading the troops straight up a hill against Lee's veterans behind a stone wall on Mary's Heights in Fredericksburg. And then he had to bring McClellan back. And that really delighted the south that showed the north that we are doomed here. We've got nobody. So yeah, it's not an encouraging move if you're trying to support the Russian army. So no wonder those nationalists are upset by it. Yeah. They try to put a brave face on and even Hirsch said, the war is going badly for much worse for Ukraine than our press let's on, which I have no doubt that's true. I mean, that's the state secret that the U.S. press is cooperating with completely, which is Ukrainian losses. No doubt they're brutal and awful. But that doesn't mean things are going great. Therefore things are going great for the other side. I mean, a lot of wars, things go really awful for both sides. And then ultimately it's kind of a weird test of wills as well as logistics later on. But yeah, the war has a lot of juice, but neither side seems to have much offensive juice. The best I could say right now. Right. I think we should get to the sort of background to Salambo and the mercenary war. Yeah. Also known as the trussless war. And it wasn't an era of great kindness. So when they distinguish a particular war as trussless, they mean yikes. Yeah, that's true. All right, so let's go on. Let's talk about the trussless war and Carthage. Let's talk Carthage Indians. Sure the Carthage Indians. They are a Semitic people or they were and it's a Semitic language. Very close to ancient Hebrew by the way. As I understand it, it would be like Russian and Ukrainian or something. I mean, they'd be able to understand each other. It was that close. Yeah. And very, they have a written alphabet that is maybe a thousand years older than the Latin one. They were originally from Phoenicia. They survived the Bronze Age collapse in about 1200 BC because they tended to build their cities on highly defensible islands like Tyre in what's now left on. Alexander the Great got so mad at Tyre because he had to build a cause way to it to take it that he massacred a good number of the inhabitants. And he wasn't really that kind of a guy. He was mad. So they had very dependable cities. They did a lot of colonizing. A lot of different groups were colonizing the Mediterranean at the time. There were Greek colonies, there were Phoenician colonies. And one of the colonies of Tyre was Carthage which comes from Cart Hadarish or something like that. The vowels are lost because it was a somatic alphabet. Something like that. Always incredibly annoying if you ever had to go to Hebrew school. I mean, they invented, I assume, much later, these fake vowels for dummies like us so you could read it. And then you had to look at the real thing and you're like, you got to be kidding me. I found that with Arabic too in my unsuccessful siege of the Arabic language. And yeah, it was like you absolutely had to guess what the vowels were going to be. And they did occasionally write them if they thought something was going to be read by foreigners. But that was training wheel stuff. Can I just say a little something about their colonizing. One of the big impetus is for really colonizing way out to the Western Mediterranean as I understand it was the Assyrian Empire. I was reading one book about ancient Carthage and the Assyrians make up an appearance what like I think around the 9th, 10th, 9th century BC. And I got to say they come off, they're really scary. I don't know much about the Assyrian Empire except like through a few Bible stories or something. But in reality, they do come off quite frightening but practical. But just really pay us the fucking money. You know, when you die. And they usually just sort of destroyed everyone. They didn't destroy Tyre or a lot of the Finnish one because they thought, well, we'll get more money basically shaking them down. And then not like directly controlling them but making sure. And so what the Assyrians wanted because they built like the most giant massive palace maybe in the history of all the empires. And they needed to feed just enormous amounts of silver and other metals towards it. And where there was a lot of silver turned out, and Phoenicians man, they were just, they were incredible merchants, credible traders. They built, they were innovators and shipping. They built boats that you know, you could actually take out into the Mediterranean Sea and when get destroyed. Anyway, they found in Spain, you know, a mother load of silver. And this is going to continuously be a running theme but back in the, in the ninth century BC. And man, they went, I mean, they went through Gibraltar and went, you know, outside up the coast like up the coast of Europe north and south along the coast of Africa. I mean, they just, they went everywhere. They were incredible. Yeah. One of the Hanoes, one of the problems with talking about Carthage is everybody is either named Hano or Hannibal or Hamel Car or some other car. Anyway, one of the early Hanoes, Hano, the great sailed halfway down the coast of Africa. It's incredible. Yeah. So most of these colonies that were founded around the shores of the Mediterranean were small and stayed small like a thousand people or less. But if you got very big and Carthage got very big by the standards of the era. At a peak, maybe Carthage had 400,000 people. Rome was bigger by the time they got into it fully. And that really mattered because Rome could draw on a bigger population. But Carthage had a big population too. It just wasn't, well, we'll talk about this. It wasn't as war centric as the Roman population was. It came into Roman literature and into Western literature around the ninth century when it's founded because it becomes part of the Trojan story that raises the question of when we're talking about with the Iliad and a lot of books have been written on that. But anyway, the angle for the Romans when they were trying to invent their own epic and invent an epic pass through themselves was how are we going to deal with Carthage? They were here first. So they invent the story that a NAS was the son of Venus. And she protected him at the fall of Troy. He goes west fling and he ends up in Carthage with Dito. Dito has told in the Iniad had founded Carthage when a local Berber King agreed to grant her refuge and as much land as she could cover with an oxide. You're supposed to imagine the Berber King going, yeah, as much land as you can cover with an oxide. But she's one of those clever heroines. So she proceeds to cut the oxide into really tiny strips. This shows her skill as a household manager, a shot-led and because she probably cuts it really thin and she places it around this hill, the Berseau, which you would definitely go for that. That's the real estate. That is like the Berkeley Hills of this whole thing. I was going to say they have a great nose for real estate. Oh God. The Phoenicians and the Carthaginians in particular. Better than the hippies even. That's saying something. Yep. And so she takes this little like one molecule wide oxide strip and winds it all around the hill of the Berseau. Like in all these stories, this particular Berber King is a man of his word unlike your typical local king who would say the hell with you lady. I'll just kill you. But anyway, yeah, he keeps his word. Carthaginians found it. Virgil land, sorry, Anastas lands in Virgil's story, which was written around 20 BC, around the beginning of the Christian era. And he arrives after the fall of Troy. Falls in love with Dido because of course. And betrays her because of course it's a very colonialist narrative. Like you were great baby. It's not you, but I've got a bigger agenda to deal with. I got a found room here and Dido knows this. She figures it out. She builds a massive pyre and throws herself on it while she says this curse. Let there be no love or treaties between our peoples. Rise, someone known Avenger from my dust who will pursue the Trojan colonists, that is the Romans, with fire and sword now or in a time to come. Whenever the strength is granted him, I pray that shore be opposed to shore, water to wave, weapon to weapon, let them fight them in their descendants. And I mean, I heard these stories as a kid. I didn't read the a Naid, but I heard like kitty versions of them. And there's another story like that that when Hannibal is a child, his father, Hamilkar takes him into some sacred cave or some place and he's like seven or something. And he says, swear that you will always be the enemy of Rome and that you will fight them to the death. And I, you know, I kind of like that sort of story for various reasons like, you know, he's going to lose, you know, he's going to die. You know, the Romans are going to win, but he keeps his vow. That one's more believable though. Oh, yeah, they were the barcos. The barcos were very much the war party in Carthage. And one of the interesting and not very reassuring implications of this story is that sometimes the war party is right. I mean, Rome was not your average trade rival who could be scared off or bought off. Either you were going to kill them or they were going to kill you, which they finally did. Yeah, the peace of party in Carthage does not come off very well. It's strange. Anyway, so Carthage, boom, wow. We've got the whole Western Mediterranean. There's nobody really competing with them. There are Greek colonies there, but they can't organize well enough. Rome is focusing on taking the Italian mainland. I mean, look where Carthage is situated, too. It's like directly south of Sardinian Corsica where it had colonies, you know, right near Sicily, right in the middle of the Mediterranean. So it's just perfectly Venice-like situated for what it does. I mean, it's as far north as the parts of Sicily. Yeah. No idea. Yeah. The Med, I imagine, you know, like they're Sicily and then way south somewhere there's Tunisia. No, they're level. Yeah, it's almost level with latitude-null-y with Syracuse. It's like north of Malta slightly. That's so weird. There's an Italian island called Lampedusa, which I recognize from Italian news because there's a lot of refugees land there these days, which is way, way south of Tunis, way south, which is why the refugees land there. Carthage is it stride at the end of the seventh century BC. It's really going strong. Rome becomes a republic around 500 BC. And originally, there's a treaty because, you know, at this town, the Mediterranean is big enough for both of us at this stage. There's a really strong sense you get of how roomy the world was back then. How it must have been glorious in a way. Well, if you didn't have a toothache or an abscess or... But there would have been so much room for everybody, which is why they could grab the best real estate. So there's an early treaty, but Carthage is soon involved in wars over Sicily. You know, as we know from the Sicities, Sicily had some pretty powerful cities there. They were too powerful for Athens and they were quite capable of taking on Carthage and being Greek. They were also, I would say, a little more warlike. The Carthaginians, you know, they didn't seem to have the... They didn't seem to love it the way the Great O'Rome and tradition did. They were about trade. You know, and war was something you had to do to keep the business going. It wasn't like the Romans with war. They don't seem to be obsessed with it in the same way. No, no, they definitely weren't. I mean, Philip Madashak has a really good book, The Enemies of Rome, in which he really stresses that. And he sort of mourns in the beginning of the book all the cultures that Rome flattened to make itself dominant. And Carthage was one of them. By the way, John Sicily, I had this idea of Sicily, maybe from the Godfather, that it was kind of dry with sort of, you know, olive trees. But the way it's described at that time, it was like this sort of... It was one of the best bits of agricultural land in that whole region. Is that... Was it like that when you're there at all? Is it dry or only recently? Or is it just the Godfather only gets one little part? Yeah. You know, we were there in Winter, and it was pretty wet actually in green. Sort of like California, you know, it whets up in the winter and greens up. And then it dries out, I think. But the whole region was wetter. There was a specific species of elephant, a really sad story, the North African elephant that got used in the wars and used in the circuses and exterminated. And it lived in the forest, along the coast, and there were forests along the coast. There still are. We saw them on the way from a moment to Tunis, but they're more like shopper-all forests, not full-on forests. And there were apparently big forests, plenty of rain for raising crops and for pasture. It was a much-friendly place. The Sicilians occupying this paradise, which it probably was, get involved in a series of wars that go from 480 BC all the way down to 339 BC, a series of six Sicilian wars in which Carthage tries to occupy the whole of Sicily. But they never really had that, as you say, obsessive concern for clonquests that the Romans had. In fact, the typical Carthaginian navy move seems to have been, this guy is a trade rival. He's not part of our cartel, ram him, sink the ship, or just if there's anything good on there, take it, and then ram the ship, send it to the bottom. They were more practical than that. As you said, they were thinking about future trade. They were quite willing to cut throats in favor of future trade. But they didn't enjoy it for its own sake in quite the same way. Then they get involved in a war that we're going to have to talk about at some episode in the future against Pyrrhus, one of the descendants of Alexander, who's kind of a freelance king, kind of a conditiero or something like that who gets involved in the Sicilian wars hoping to carve out a kingdom for himself. And then at that point, Carthage makes a deal with the Romans. They actually ferry the Romans in their ships against Pyrrhus. And Pyrrhus is famous, of course, for Pyrrhus victory because he's up against the Romans who are quite a thing, quite a new thing. And he says to one of his generals who said, we won. He says, yeah, we win again. Like this, I'm not going to have an army left. Because the Romans always made you pay, even if they lost. Just scary people. So Pyrrhus is defeated in southern Italy by the Romans with Carthage and help and the cities of southern Italy, which even now is called Magna Grecia. They're very aware of their Greek past, submit to Rome. And that ends the period of war. And it's a good moment to see the sort of lack of strategic vision in the Carthaginian areas. Like they helped Rome. Was that smart? They thought so because, you know, all right, we have a deal with these people. We'll have a stable trade arrangement. We do the West Mediterranean. They do Italy and Greece and all that. That'll be fine. But they did not understand Rome clearly. Rome was, I mean, there have been Marxist historians arguing that as Roman agriculture became Latifundi, giant estates, by a single aristocrat, that Rome became sort of like a slave rating ant hill. And conquest and slave raids became the basis of the economy. And to placate the displaced working class, you created the army and fed them and offered them a piece of land at the end of their long, long service. But you know, Rome was not going to compromise. They were never happy with the status quo. They probably would have invented space flight just to take Mars if they had been around long enough. So this leads to the first Punic War. There are going to be three. It reminds me a little bit of America. As soon as America, the Americans conquered the whole continent, you know, went from the Atlantic all the way to the Pacific. Like they barely even took a breath before they started what is called the, you know, the age of imperialism, right? It's like, okay, now we're going to start conquering overseas. And it's been that ever since. And so you would think the Carthaginians would see, okay, they're gobbling up this peninsula, you know, mountain by mountain, town by town, colony. And once they reach the boot heel and boot toe, where are they going to go next? I mean, what do you think is going to happen? Yeah. There are a lot of mysteries about these, these wars. And I think, you know, we're coming to them as students. And we're not pretending to be people who've spent our lives on this. But I think there are a lot of questions that are raised here. One of them is, did these peoples understand each other at all? Was Rome really something new? Why didn't the Carthaginians understand Rome? Why didn't the Romans give up? Why was this naval power completely unable to show any naval supremacy? Why was a power Rome that somebody, as Philip Madagzak quotes, Rome took to naval warfare like a brick to water? How were they able to defeat the dominant naval power of the Western Mediterranean for hundreds of years? Hundreds of years, yeah. It does not make sense. And we're just looking at these questions. We're opening them up. I asked one of those questions today like about what happened to the Carthaginian Navy on the Gary Brecher Facebook page. And we've had a lot of interesting answers. And maybe we can open up the discussion as we go. I don't think we claim to have the answer here. But what we do have is a receive narrative. Like there's a receive narrative of what happened. Rome discovers an intact Carthaginian naval vessel and the parts are numbered so they can figure out how to create a new one. Okay, maybe. And then they revive the Corvas, a kind of movable landing ramp that can extend a gang plank for Marines to the other ship, which was used by the Sicilians in past wars. And that enables them instantly to defeat the Carthaginian Navy in a massive battle as big as anything up to the Battle of the Naval Battles of World War II. Eccnomus off the coast and Sicily getting a little ahead of the story here. But how is that possible? I mean, it makes sense in the traditional classical narrative. But I don't trust classicists. They have these narratives that they got from their sacred texts and they tend to believe them. Okay, somebody invents a gimmick against the Royal Navy in 1850 or something. Were it supposed to believe that a loan would work for them? I mean, I'm thinking about our totally tanked episode. You know, it was at Schwartzkopf said it wasn't the tank. It was the tank crews, right? So that if the well-trained US tank crews were in T-72s, they would have defeated the more poorly trained Iraqi tank crews in Abrams. So it is hard to understand. The Romans were not known to be. They didn't have a history of being great seafaring people, great Navy. Their first two attempts at the Navy, they just sank them. I mean, they were built with green wood. They were terrible at it. And then suddenly a year later, they pop up and they wipe out the dominant naval power for hundreds of years. It is weird. It is really weird. Another question I saw brought up in one book, but they never explored it. They just kind of brought it up like, God, this is strange. Was why did the Carthaginians, I mean, this is the first Punic War, mostly in Sicily. It's a very long war. And there are several different sort of invasion waves of Romans moving into Sicily from the Italian mainland. And the Carthaginians never used their Navy to try to interdict the Roman landing parties. Why? One of the things that Flobera intuited in Salambo is treason. Yeah. The Carthaginian elite was deeply invited and they hated each other. And at every key moment in this war, they will betray the Barca's. The Barca's are the war party and the dominant clan. And I think a lot of people in Carthage probably were glad to see them get isolated in difficult places. The Barca's as an enemy was much closer and more real than this imagined idea that some other, some, you know, podunk town Rome could actually conquer us. I mean, you have to remember Carthage was such a far more luxurious, complex, you know, amazing city than Rome was, for example. I mean, it was very opulent, very like the building. It was just so much more advanced and so much more sort of dazzling than Rome. So yeah, their hatred of the Barca family would have just been much more real to them than the idea they could ever be conquered. As I was saying, this is a weird moment because like, I guess we've sort of drifted into an anti-war camp most of the time on Radio Warner. But the war party in Carthage was sort of right. The peace party was sort of wrong. Sometimes you got to stamp them out. Anyway, I think we're going to have to spend more than one episode on this, but we can at least get to the first punitive war, which in some ways is the most important here. So the first face-off between Carthage and Rome. So this is happening around 310 BC. And again, Sicily is the flashpoint because, yeah, as you were saying, Mark, Sicily is very, very rich. It's like paradise, really. And it's weird because I was studying Italian this summer with a teacher. You know, when you're studying a language, you slowly discover the real ideology of the teacher just because of the sentences they choose. And she was, what I later found out is a real ideology in contemporary Italy called neo-Borbonism. And it's this belief that the south of Italy is the naturally rich and good part of Italy. The north is the grim quasi-dramatic part. And that they robbed everything from Italy. And Garibaldi is not a name to conjure with in the mind of this neo-Borbon woman who was teaching class. She was really weird, too, because a lot of ideologues want to be hurt, want to be confirmed in their rage. So that's the first question. And she asked was, supposedly for us to practice our Italian, what are some of the stereotypes for southern Italians? Everybody looks at each other. Oh, my God. Does she really want us to do this? She just wants to lecture somebody so badly. So we all gave her those stereotypes and her foot started tapping faster and faster. And then came the reckoning. There was a 20 minute lecture on how that was because they robbed us, they took everything. Sicily is naturally the richest and finest and happiest place in the world. By that point, everybody in the class, you know, they're these mild, middle-aged, Austrian people mostly in their thing. Yeah, sure. Okay. Absolutely. No one's arguing. Right, Neo-Borbon is this ideology in southern Italy. It reflects the rule of the kingdom of the two Sicilies, meaning basically southern Italy and Sicily itself, by a Spanish branch of the Bourbon family, so that they dominated the south. And this is creating nostalgia among some southern Italians. I should point out that the counterargument is they treated you like slaves. And that's what you hear in the north. The poverty of 19th century southern Italy is unbelievable. I mean, I think I've said before, you have no sense, especially if you're from North America, how stable your own culture has been no matter how much it seemed to you it was changing. You got people driving around in zippy little expensive cars now whose grandparents were agricultural slaves all over. I mean, it's extraordinary. Okay. So yeah, Sicily is a big prize. And it becomes the scene of the beginning of the first showdown where basically Carthage and Rome decide, I guess the Mediterranean isn't big enough for both of us anymore. And this is a proxy war, classic proxy war that big powers get into using the little ones and really sleazy, you know, like the mammarteen, meaning sons of Mars. This group of Italian mercenaries who had been involved in Sicilian warfare, it's too complicated to get into, but basically they just march into what is now Messina on the east coast of Sicily, kill all the men, rape all the women and say, this is our town now. And they're afraid someone's going to displace them so they say, hey, Carthage, you want to help us and Carthage helps. And then they say, hey, Rome, you want to help us? You might be stronger than Carthage and then the Romans come in and they eventually take Messina and they ally more effectively with the Romans than they did with the Sicilians. And this gives Rome a toehold. According to the sources we have, which are coincidentally all Roman, this was a big shock to the Romans, like, oh, that reminds me, using your analogy before, reminds me very much of Pauli and good fellow, I mean, well, I want to have a restaurant, I don't know if they're about the restaurant business. But they were quite happy to be stuck with it, like, okay, I'll do you a favor. And that terrifies the Carthage Indians. Sicily is one of their biggest possessions. And soon the Sicilians, sorry, soon the Romans and Carthage Indians are fighting desperately over Sicily. This war is so bloody, like all these wars were, that population size starts to come into it. Rome has become a really big place. Maybe 800,000 people Carthage with maybe 250,000. But those numbers don't really cover it because war is the business of a Roman citizen. It's what you're about. War is not the business of the Carthaginian citizen. In fact, it's a little, unless you're a Barca, it's a little rough and crude. It's not for you. You're supposed to hire people to do your wars and stick to trade. You can go into the Navy. And this is sort of common in many cultures, like the Navy's are aristocratic, but armies are very bloody, very rough. So we have to talk about the structure of these two societies. Yes. Basically, Romans are crazy. They're killers. We grew up with this idea of Rome as having inherited the world and then they started eating grapes and playing horses. And back stabbing each other. Yeah. They did do a game of throne stuff. It's not like that. No, they earned it with blood. And they were very enthusiastic about it. Service in the Roman army, and there was no Navy at this point. They hated Navy. It couldn't swim basically. It was kind of an honor. You aspired to that. You had to own a certain amount of property to serve in the army. You had to be a Roman citizen. And that was quite a big deal. Even St. Paul, centuries later, says somewhere I think Romanasum. I'm a Roman, meaning I'm a Roman citizen. You can't torture me without halfway decent evidence. So serving in the army was the proof that you were somebody. It was an absolute prerequisite to a political career, to membership of the Middle East. They had a weird system that is sort of reflected in the Carthaginian system. The consulship, they were nervous about military dictatorship quite rightly. And so they elected two consuls, two because you wanted a two headed beast. It wasn't efficient. So no one military commander could just say, I run this place now. The consuls had veto power over the other consuls decision, which seems like a recipe for inefficiency. But again, that was the idea. They were members of the aristocratic elite. They were elected yearly by an assembly, which was also made up of that elite. The richer and more snooty citizens were the cavalry. And by the way, Rome had a really lousy cavalry in the beginning. And they did that because in a sort of proto-futal arrangement, they could furnish their own horse and their own equipment. The middle class, something like the middle class, formed the infantry. And it was an honor to be admitted to the infantry. The proletari, which means what you think, the lower social class. It's sort of the property list class, right? Yeah. They did not get to be infantry. You wouldn't think this. Get to be infantry. I know. Have a spear stuck in your eye. But yeah, they were lively folks in them days. They thought that way. They did not get to be infantry. They could only serve as oarsmen in the fleet, which they did. That was part of why Rome was running out of proletarians by the end of this war. But also the reason why the upper, the middle and upper classes would want to exclude them was because war was business for Rome, especially Rome. I mean, I think for most cultures, until recently, you know, war meant booty, war meant you could enrich yourself or move up socially and economically. And so that means that now, remember that stat about the leading zip codes in the US. They're all Northern Virginia. But I mean serving right now. It's the opposite. Now when you serve, actually, you end up on the streets, a V.A. hospital or a homeless. But if you're feeding into the war machine, yeah, you're in a McMansion right now, toasting the next war. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But that's true. You absolutely wanted control of the war machine because I think it must be related. This isn't usually part of the classical narrative. But look, Romans couldn't sail ships. They were an inland city. Right. They didn't seem to do much with international trade, at least willingly, with willing partners. Carthage was a coastal city. Totally at home on the water. They traded with anybody. They had a very different attitude towards war. Carthage could make money in peacetime. It's not clear that Rome could make money in peacetime. Right. So the Carthaginian army was mercenary army, basically, if you want to use that term. But before we get into this, there's some stat that I think Polybius, one of the better historians of these wars, points out, which is you can talk about mercenaries if you want. But Hannibal spent 16 years in Italy with an army composed of these mercenaries from all kinds of different nations. They went through hell for him. They never defected. They never betrayed him. They fought like demons for him. And they never lost a battle. That's the amazing thing. Hannibal never lost a battle in 16 years in Italy. Incredible. Whereas the Carthaginian elites were back in Carthage, plotting backstabbing. Right? So that's a really good point because we always assume. And I think there's often a lot of truth to it that, I mean, sort of like France's Republican army, right? These were sort of empowered. They had a stake in their society that they were going out to defend and spread. And that supposedly made them better fighters. It might have actually. But this proves that that attitude. I mean, yeah. The ancient world was just different. Yeah. There were all kinds of appeals to pride and to your cohort, your general. And that was part of it too. You were loyal to Hannibal or to the Barca's, not to Carthage. It was kind of hard to be loyal to Carthage for a lot of these people because it had a sleazy side, but that was not the Barca's side. So these are so-called mercenary units from some of the African neighbors of the Carthaginians, Libyans who formed mostly infantry. The Numidians really important, like the best light cavalry in the world. They didn't even use saddles. They had a shield and two or three spears. They would throw the spears, gallop out of range, come back. And they were the key to the Carthaginians' most effective strategy, which is kind of like the little big horn strategy. You act surprised when the Romans show up, you go, ah, oh, Romans! And then you run away. And the Romans chase you and you can count on Hannibal to have something waiting for them that they did not expect. And a lot of Romans die that way. Also Iberians, this is basically Spain. So earliest treaties between Rome and Carthage allowed Carthage to develop colonies south of the Ebro River, which is a little south of the Pyrenees. That meant that Hamilkar dies crossing a river. A lot of people in the ancient world die crossing rivers anyway. And Hannibal, they were building, by all accounts, a Barca empire. They were not through with Carthage as it was. A Barca empire centered in Spain. A lot of silver in Spain, a lot of people who like to fight. And it was virgin territory. They've got them, they've got the Gauls. Gauls really hated Romans. One of the Roman generals in this war likes to go into battles supposedly with a Gauls scalp on his helmet with the long hair that they wore. Gauls didn't like that surprisingly. There's also Greek phalanxes. So it's an army with some weaknesses as in where the Carthaginians are just not there. But a lot of strength, like they could do many different things. The Greeks or the Iberians could present a wall of shields. The Numidians could harass an enemy. They had slingers who could basically... Right, the Balaric. Yeah. Just think. You guys from Ibiza, maybe you just took Coke and Trans music now, but way back then you were great slingers. I know. That was a cool little addition to it. They found some of those sling shots, led shots, I think, saying in Greek, take this. What? Are they right little things on it? Yeah. Like the way they write on missiles nowadays. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there's a scene. There's a World War I scene in the Simpsons where the young Monty Burns is watching his officer give a movie speech with a grenade and his hand. Take this. This is for Bernstein. He's not some... Yeah, but it was the same spirit. The Navy, as we were saying, was permanent. They always had a Navy. Which again, it's like, yeah, that seems right. So why did they do so badly? That was by Carthaginian citizens. It was a respectable place for elite Carthaginians to serve. The Army was just mustard up when you thought you were going to need it, which is generally considered a weakness and it probably was. The only time Carthaginian citizens would be conscripted into the Army was when the city itself was threatened. So yeah, there's a difference in force structure or the place of war in the whole culture here. And the strengths of Carthaginian citizens like Carthaginian had a way of existing as a peacetime city. It's not clear the room did. It's not with 800,000 people to feed. You basically have to take some slaves. Yeah, I mean, what's happening around the time of the first punic war anyway. Well, and it really gathers pace up to the next couple of months is that inequality really is spinning out of control in Rome. And it's sort of warping everything. We might do some more of this, John Boat. You and I have been reading some books by Matt O'Shaek. Of course, there's the, what's it called, the Jurgethine War, the solest book that I remember in here. You could just send me the corruption that backs that, it just gets so out of hand. But underneath all of that is this sort of accelerating accumulation of land, financialization of land by a smaller and smaller elite. And you've got to do something with this massive city and everybody else who is disempowered. So yeah, you conquer more lands and you find ways to eventually bring in, you need to conquer a lot more lands in order to appease the people around you in Rome and give them at least some hope at some point that if they survive all kinds of crap, they'll eventually get there. At the time of the first Punic War, you know, that we're still early in that process. There's a sense that war was beneficial for the people who mattered in Rome. And it really didn't seem to be beneficial, except maybe for the Barca clan, if they'd managed to start their own empire in Spain, but that project never really came off. The amazing thing is that in this first Punic War, this allegedly great Carthaginian navy is terrible, just terrible. And again, I don't think anybody's explained this right. We've talked many times about how armies are degraded by counterinsurgency and low level of thuggish enforcing of trade monopolies rather than fighting equal opponents. And that could be it because the Carthaginian navy was very much in favor of sinking competitorships, especially the unarmed ships. They were fine with that, but they were not in the habit of fighting equal opponents, even the Greek city states were not fully equal. Rome somehow, somehow, and this is Rome, which people laughed at Rome as a navy. You know, Rome took to the water, took to naval fighting like brick to water. Somehow Rome builds a fleet of 120 ships in two months and almost instantly defeats a Carthaginian fleet off Sicily. Again, think of the Royal Navy suddenly being destroyed by in the mid 19th century by say revolutionary France that just comes up with the idea we're going to need a navy and boom, creates one. The biggest battle in this war on the naval battle was enormous off the southern coast of Sicily. The Romans are supposedly victorious because they have this mobile gang plank called the Corvus. Basically, just a swivel gang plank held vertically in the middle of the ship until you come into contact with the enemy ship. There's a spike right at the end of the gang plank. So when you release this gang plank, it embeds itself in the enemy ship that'll out the Romans who had much better Marines on their ships to board the Carthaginian ships and basically kill everybody. And what was the Carthaginian response to this? There wasn't one. There's a battle with almost 150,000 people on each side. The Carthaginian fleet is supposed to be able to ram the Roman fleet, but it doesn't seem to have any projectile weapons, any other strategies for dealing with the Roman fleet. There's a kind of non-adaptedness in the Carthaginian naval strategy, which is very strange. So basically, they find that to ram the Romans, you need to be right up against them. That puts you in range of this swivel gang plank. When you ram the Roman ships, they swarm onto your ships like ants and you lose. So they can't do anything about this. The only way they ever win is by knowing the weather better than the Romans. And this is one thing you'd think that a power that's been sailing around that part of the Mediterranean would know how to do. So best move the Carthaginians have is to know the weather, go into harbor and let the Romans die in huge numbers. So in the Battle of Fentheus, in the middle of the war, 249 BC, there's 120 warships roughly on each side. But the Romans are also protecting 800 troop transports. The Carthaginian captains tell the Admiral, we know this weather pattern, we better go into harbor. They do. They write out the storm. The Romans try to attack. They're out at sea in the storm. They lose 17 ships. They lose all the transports basically, all but two ships out of this massive fleet. And they come back and they win the war. Yeah, I mean, a sort of a generalist version of this that I've heard to sort of sum it up as the Romans. You know, got that blueprint, as you mentioned, for the Queen Cream, I think I'm pronouncing it right. And the one that they sort of took apart because what is true is the Carthaginians did have like pretty advanced shipbuilding capabilities and they did shipbuilding almost like in a factory. So it would be something like numbered. But anyway, so the Romans put out one fleet, but they used green wood. So they basically sank and they built up another fleet. Still had green wood. Still killed some people, but then eventually sank. And they just kind of kept at it. They would hire Greek mercenaries. They started imitating shipbuilding and ship tactics from roads. But as you said, all this was what we know about it was all comes from the winning side, from the Roman side. So it is kind of a mystery. Does it power degrade sort of after 300 years? I mean, it's... Yeah. And there's really only one source even on the Roman side, which is the Greek Polybius. There were a lot of sources on the Carthaginian side, but they were all very systematically destroyed. I mean, the Romans destroyed the Carthaginian literature the way of the Spanish destroyed the Aztec records. They made a point of it. It was not just an unfortunate accident that was policy. So all this pedantry about the war, and it's a lot of very impressive pedantry, is based on a single text, basically, and that's kind of frightening. And what I keep finding, and I admit this, as someone who's coming to this, not as someone who's dedicated his life to it, but is trying to understand it, what I find is that I keep discovering key facts that ruin the whole narrative. For example, I'm trying to research that famous, ultra-famous military harbor in Carthage, which we visited when we were there. And I'm trying to figure out whether they could actually produce so many triremes in a certain period, as is often claimed, at that famous circular harbor, which, by the way, it's still there, and it's pretty cool to look at. But then, I just come across this fact that the circular harbor was not built until after Carthage had already lost the first and second wars. It was basically, Carthage had already been gutted when they built that. They had this cylindrical harbor before that, but that had been, that was supposedly going to be dedicated to cargo. They didn't have that circular harbor that everybody shows diagrams of. It was not there. Like when you try to find out where and how did Hamilkar Gisgo died. Well, either his troops crucified him after a defeat, and they crucified him on the beach at Sardinia, or he was brought home and tried and crucified there. No one knows. There's a lot that no one knows. And when you look at the implied narrative, as I said, many times, you keep coming back to this idea, Carthage's navy wasn't that good. And that's why it's kind of reassuring to come across this book. Carthage's Other Wars by Dexter Hoyos, which was published in 2019. Again, that's Carthage's Other Wars Dexter Hoyos, H-O-Y-O-S, who finally says some of the stuff that we've been coming across, that we've been concluding reluctantly because it violates these received ideas. There's a lot of buvard and pekushet, you know, about the Punic Wars. And Hoyos just says, Carthage's prowess at sea was in fact far less accomplished than usually assumed, either by ancients or moderns. Although Greeks and Romans did tend to view Carthage retrospectively as the Western Mediterranean's great naval power, when Wars came, its fleet seldom had unmatched superiority over their rivals, nor did a sea battle decide any of Carthage's non-Roman wars. And he really emphasized this, in warfare and strategy, Carthage's enduring strategy was operations by armies on land. Not one military or political leader was a merchant, meaning, you know, a seafarer. And only one or maybe two were seafarers. The ruling elite was landed grandees, like the Latifundia owners in Rome. The ruling elite were Latendid grandees, like the fourth centuries, Hanoh the Great, with his country estate, and supposed 20,000 slaves, or Hannibal the Barquad, who owned a wealthy country estate. And driving the point home, he adds, I gotta say, this is a great relief to read this by somebody who actually has the cred. Supreme command in major campaigns was held by the general of the army, the Rob Mahanat. By the way, that's an interesting name. Rob as in, well, it's a Semitic language. So I presume Rob is the same as like Rob-I, or the high-professional. Yeah. And the admiral was always his deputy. I mean, you would not have found that with the Royal Navy, for example. They didn't take orders from the army. They ran the thing. So he concludes his book with greater emphasis on warfare at sea. Carthage might have enjoyed greater success in its other wars. It might even have faced the Romans as ruler of all Sicily. That would have changed history. Because you've got something roughly like a Napoleonic Wars confrontation going on in the Punic Wars between an unstoppable land power and what's supposedly a really powerful navy. Only it doesn't act like a really powerful navy. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense because towards the end of that war, I mean, again, according to what I have been reading, trying to get some understanding of this. Sort of in the last five to plus years of the war, after Rome's invasion into North Africa and to Libya, basically, they tried to invade Carthage with this massive, de-day style invasion. And ultimately, it was a total failure. And after that, the Carthaginians decided really to wage a war to fully subdue and extract, and fully subdue and extract from Libya and other parts of North Africa. And it was a very lucrative war. That was actually quite a lucrative war. And it went very well. They just went in and were able to destroy, pacify and slave. I mean, it was like something out of world of wars or something. What they did there, whereas in Sicily where they really needed their navy, it was just an endless expense. And the Romans were too difficult. And I mean, that's sort of one of the, you know, aside from treachery, one of the sort of more practical excuses for why the Carthaginians decided after the last time in 241, after the last time the fleet was destroyed, they decided it ain't worth it to build up another fleet and continue this war. Because well, their land war was going so well in Libya. And yeah. And that was going to yield them new estates. Yeah. I mean, that was going to be turned into these giant farms, not on the Roman model, but very similar to what was going on in Rome. And a lot of people didn't want to, you know, my tax money going to stuff that's not going to yield any profit because the war against Rome was not going to be profitable. You didn't make money fighting Rome. You hung on if you could. If you were fighting these small local tribes or people's kingdoms, whatever, in Numidia or Libya, you could do the usual thing of playing them off against each other and then crushing them one by one. And at the end of it, you'd have this beautiful estate that now no longer had any people in it. So there was a big fashion. Or fashion. Yeah. Or you made them slaves. Yeah. So what Hoyos says, and it's a great relief overall, is like, you know, you can get rid of the myth of Carthaginian supremacy in naval war. He says another thing when you mentioned D-Day, which is like, like I was thinking, why doesn't Hannibal use Carthaginian ships just to sail his forces, Italy? And I've checked. We did have enough of a fleet that they could have done that by stone, even in the second war. But Hoyos says, combined operations with Carthaginian, naval and land forces acting together against an objective are not often heard of. Every one of them failed sometimes miserably. Yes. So they just didn't do that. They weren't good at it. And, you know, there's a strange inflexibility about Carthaginian, maybe because their navy was used to sink pirates and other rivals for trade. And that sort of low-level service degrades a force. But the lack of projectile weapons in that battle of agnomus that we were talking about seems really extraordinary. Even when they discover the Corvus, they must have discovered the Corvus fairly early on in the battle because it sticks way up in the air and you can see what it's doing. Well, why didn't they attack the Roman ships from the rear? The Corvus does not extend and cannot be extended the entire length of the ship. And they were supposed to know how to attack ships from the rear. They're supposed to be the superb sailors and all that. It seems to me like a really good example of received ideas that were partly born out of classical education because the Romans were awfully fond of themselves. And when you think of this being taught to British schoolboys of the empires, they really would have took to that because it's like one empire that was very fond of itself reading passages from another empire that was very fond of itself. And to do that, they talked about how glorious it was that in a couple of years they managed to field a navy out of nothing and beat this superb, trim, fast, efficient, carthaginian navy. And there's not much evidence for that. I mean, yeah, there's another angle on this, too. Yeah, Polybius, I believe, was writing four sponsored by one of the consulate. Wasn't it skip you, Africanis? I don't know. I don't know. But yeah. I remember hearing this in one lecture I was listening to. And I mean, obviously, this was for them, the Great War. They're not going to make your patron and all the elders look a lot better. Or if they defeated the greatest military in history as sort of as underdogs. I mean, you can see that in America, you know, we're always every war we depict ourselves as underdogs. And, you know, this is actually... Well, yeah, I mean, it used to get to me, as I think we've talked about a few other times, like when Clint Eastwood tries to make a conquest movie out of the invasion of Grenada. That was sort of where I defected from America. And it's just, no, I mean, no. Well, Marie Spisha, do you feel like... Yes. Yeah. You've staged a glorious victory against 500 destruction workers from Cuba with AKs. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, it's hard to say. I mean, I think there is a... There is corroborating evidence that Hannibal, who will be Hamilkar's son for the Second Pinaig World, you know, is an unusually good, amazing general, but he didn't win. No. And yeah, and the Romans have every reason to sort of... And they let down when he needed resupply. Yeah. They were always letting people down. And that's what we're going to get into in the next episode where we talk about the literature, well, a particular literary version of the Punic Second Punic War, Salambo, which is one of the... No, no, no, it's about the... I'm sorry. It's about the mercenary war. Yeah, but I'd say it's about the... The Second Punic War as well, because he's describing the fractures in Carthaginian society that... Yes, that's true. ...destroided. I mean, Hanoh is such a great character in there, and he's considered responsible for one of their defeats. So I mean, I also realized when I was rereading Salambo that... I'm sure many an article has been written on this. I haven't read them, but I'm sure they are out there. That Flob\u00e8re is a, you know, not anti-French writer. And he sees France as very Carthaginian, and it's not clear who the Romans are. They can be the British or they can be the Prussians, probably more likely the Prussians in this story. But it's this gloomy, typically self-loathing French story of how this glittering, beautiful, wealthy culture finally... Decadent. Yeah, waste, everything. Yeah, yeah, debacle. Yeah, debacle, yeah. Very decadent, that's true. I mean, yeah, it's almost over the top in that way. So we'll talk about Salambo more. I had forgotten until I reread it again for this, like, what a, I don't know, a sort of cold, passionate love story it is, too. I mean, it really is a love story, but it's so coldly told. Yeah. It's a strange thing. You haven't really come across any novel like it ever before. No, no. I think in a culture like Saudi, maybe it could be understood better. I mean, they're never going to get to meet. She thinks about Matho a lot. He thinks about her all the time. Because in those traditional gendered cultures, the male is supposed to be besotted and the woman is supposed to... If she is besotted, she's not supposed to let it. But I don't want to know. Right. Yeah. And then, well, I don't know if we can do spoilers, but then... No. Well, we can do it maybe next episode, but let's save it for next episode. Yeah. So this has been our big background to what's going to be the next episode, which will be Salambo, Floubert Salambo, and the Mercenary War that he writes about, which is really describing the setup for the second punic war, as well as you said. I mean, I think Hannibal is even born, or he's certainly mentioned in Salambo. Yeah, he's the son. Right. Hidden that from everybody, because of course, his fellow Carthaginian elite would kill him, if they could. Yeah. Okay, good. All right. I think we can wrap up part one right now. Thanks again, everyone. Thank you, John. Thanks for everybody to see you.",
