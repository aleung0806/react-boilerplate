    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. The day today is September 21st, 2022 and this is episode 347. I'm the Ghost Mark Ames. I am here in Rochester, New York and I'm in line with Warner, Gary Brecher, a cage on Dolan, Still in Tropea and happy Fall Equinox. Oh yeah, happy Fall Equinox. I was think the culture should have a ritual for the Equinox, but we don't. Well, even worse than that in much of the world or at least the European world, September 1st by gum is the first day of fall. My wife and I fight about this every six months because it's like, no, it's the Equinox. You can't, you know, but then it's like, well, people make up whatever they want to make up. You call it fall because, well, in a lot of the North, well, that's when school starts and it's sort of the world sort of changes. See Europeans get vacations, Americans don't. Yeah. Well, August is sacred here. You should have seen what happened to the beaches down at the base of the cliff here when was September 1st. Oh yeah. Just if there had been a population of man eating sharks out there, they would have suddenly gotten very hungry. Where'd you go? So how you doing? Oh, well, we're just, you know, we're moving to Triass soon for the second four months ago, six month Italian learning process. And it's just just in time because the apartment is falling apart piece by piece like the door is so warped, you have to stick a pair of underwear in it to close it. It doesn't close on its own. And today the bathroom ceiling started leaking massively because apparently some dumb tours upstairs left the water on and the AC drips so loudly that you have to turn it off when you go to sleep so you wake up sweaty. It's like, you know, we're going to make it out just before the whole thing. Then you're heading to Triass. And up there you might be needing heat pretty soon. And this is going to be the year apparently. I mean, you tell me, I don't know, maybe you already have heat built into your rental agreement or whatever you guys have worked out, but could get expensive. I have from, you know, even here. Yeah, it's a long thing. It's good. The apartment could fail to materialize a lot. Yeah, that would be the least of the worries right now, I guess would be. Could have no heat, you know, there's always that too. Hopefully you'll have internet, you know, so you can, well, we're at a hotel tonight. I mean, we've never had internet in the apartment. Yeah. So hopefully the next place will have it. Well, yeah, don't bear with thinking about it. All right. So today we have, thanks to a member of the Radio Warner community, we got in touch with Ryan Train, who designs war board games. We've talked about war computer video games to a couple of great episodes on that one with Guna Ruff and Jonson, front of the show. And, but these are board games. So these are analog, old school, feeling with your hands, touch them, cut them out, roll the dice, flip the cards games. This is really, this is really cool because I, as a, as a very young Warner, that's how I got sort of my start in this whole thing was board game. And I think John, well, you've, you've kind of written eloquently about risk and its influence. Yeah. Yeah. But you played the more bad stuff. I did when I was younger. Yeah, I did. And so it was kind of cool to get. It was like a memory, sort of one of those things that I completely forgot about until somebody reminded me of these games. And I got to say they're really cool, really fun to put together and they really make you think about, you know, all the different, it's like, it's very, I don't know, three, four dimensional. It's just, it really makes you like think about all the different factors that go into battles or war. And clearly, Brian has, and this will come out during the interview. Brian has designed games that allow for the reality of 21st century war, which there is not a final battle. There's not a Stalin grad or a Gettysburg. Right. A lot depends on media and morale. But yeah, we'll, we'll get into that in the interview. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. First before we get to it, I think let's just catch up on a little bit of recent war news. And then we'll get to our interview. I don't want to make this too long, but we do have to say a few things. The first one, of course, being the Ukraine war. In the past, I don't know, 12, 24 hours, a pretty serious, potentially serious, I'd say it's pretty damn serious. Turn of events just happened. Putin, I don't know how much that's reaching out there, but Putin, I don't know how much that's reaching out there, but Putin, first, the Duma passed a series of laws. This all happened within like a 24, 48 hour period. The Duma rushed through the Russian Duma, rushed through a series of laws, imposing harsh criminal penalties for refusing to serve when you're conscripted. And a lot of Russian historical going back, you know, the Yeltsin time before they have evaded service one way or another. Criminalizing, surrendering, criminalizing, you know, objecting serve. And we know that protesting war, or even calling the special military operation war, has also been criminalized. And then this was followed up by the snap announcements by the regions that Russia has as partial or more or less full control of in Ukraine, that would be Lohansk, Danetsk, Kyrzhen, and Zaparizhye, as a bit of the Zaparizhye, Zaparizhye, Oblast region. They're going to hold referendums on breaking away from Ukraine and joining Russia and being annexed by Russia. And that happened very fast. And then Putin announced, or his people announced that Putin was going to give a speech along with Defense Minister Sergei Shogu, the speech was supposed to happen last night, so that would have been September 20th. And everybody was waiting and waiting and waiting. And then it didn't happen. And instead it happened in the morning, this morning, the 21st Moscow time. And the basic takeaway is Putin announced a mobilization. People are calling it a partial mobilization. I've seen a lot of people in the West and the Ukraine supporters of to one degree or another, trying to, I don't know, minimize it. Let me put it this way. It came as a shock to people. It came as a shock to supporters of Ukraine or opponents of the war. And it came, I think it was received with Glee by the pro-Russia side because they've been pulling out their hair over the last month as Russia has been getting stomped on the battlefield, particularly in the heart of region. And not only because of that, but because the pro-Russia side and the nationalists within Russia and the people and Putin's right and the Soviet Union, they've been, I think, increasingly angry that more resources have not been put towards this war. And we've even asked that. It has seemed strange. Either Putin has been deluded or everyone's afraid to tell him what's really been going on there. And they've tried to win this war in the cheap, rumsfeld style. And it's been a failure. And there's always on the right, there's always the one-hand tied behind our backs. Yes, argument. And there's a lot of that going on. There was a lot of that in the US during Vietnam. And because you're a big country, they're much smaller than you. How can you possibly be defying you like this? Yeah. There's a lot of that. So, you know, you get mixed signals out of this. One is, well, it's not really a big call. They're basically saying that people who are serving on contracts, surprise, surprise, they're going to be forced to stay in the battlefield or, you know, stay on contract indefinitely. The old stop-lossing. Yeah. Also, they're going to be calling up all sorts of reservists who have specializations. But that's, I think, really the first phase of it. People have read through the decrease a little more carefully, say, this is a mobilization decree. Now they're talking about mobilizing up to 300,000 people in Russia. And that would make a difference. It would take a while. I mean, Ukraine first mobilized immediately after the invasion. So that was what, seven months ago now. So it's going to take a while for these mobilized forces to make much of a dent in the battlefield. In the meantime, you know, Russia's still losing ground. I mean, I don't know. By the time this goes out, it's quite possible that Lehman might be taken, which is a very important rail hub and an important sort of gateway to retake if Ukraine is going to retake. This is Chant's conservative Donetsk. It's, I think at that point, it just got so shocking somehow. It either dawned on Putin, you know, the all-wise Vladimir Putin or everybody who had been lying to him to cover their asses pretty much had to explain what was going on. I think there's a couple of kind of more worrying aspects to this. Not only does it mean, of course, the war's going to go on, but what, from what I've gleaned from Putin's speech, he's reiterating something that he said and tried to make a, you know, try to make a point of in his pretty scary speeches in February and the eve of the invasion, which is that they're going to, like, they're going to keep escalating more as the other side escalates. Basically, if NATO keeps escalating, the U.S. escalates, then Russia, or, you know, the Kremlin is going to escalate because to Putin, whatever degree you think Putin represents Russia or not at all, to Putin, this is an existential war. This is an existential threat and an existential war. And he's made it clear that they'll go nuke if they have to, if they keep having to escalate. And he said this again in his speech this morning that he said, this is not a bluff. He used that exact phrase or something to that effect. This is not a bluff. And I got to say, you know, people used to talk about, well, you know, what are the odds that Russia will use nuke? And I just, you know, every time, even when you think you're starting to get a handle on the war, you never really do because, I don't know, it's war. But I got to say, this is the first time that I've really thought, wow, you know, that might actually happen. I'd give the chance of a very low odds still because for a lot of obvious reasons or a lot of downsides to using nuke's. But I think, I do think he really means it. And as long as he's in power, I think it is a real possibility. And what I find kind of frightening about it is that when you see the way that the US and the West responds to that again warning and Putin's been warning that this war would happen and these would happen, you know, these, these more violent steps would happen going back to at least 2007 when the US first held out sort of NATO membership to Ukraine. The response from Western political people and media people is basically to mock, to mock it. It's like, oh, he's saying this again. This is like the 10th time he's threatened. Don't take it seriously. To also policing everybody else, anybody who shows concern and saying, basically, if you take seriously the nuclear threats, you're giving into terrorism. So we must all not take it seriously. We must demonstrate that we don't take it seriously. And on principle, if we take it seriously, if we listen to it and in any way adjust our policy based on that, then we're done and there's no more West, there's no more democracy, there's no more freedom. It's all over. Like it's really that. It's really that. Yes, it's Munich. Yes. It may well be that Putin has decided the US won the Cold War for a lot of reasons, but among others, because it was always playing the lunatic as Nixon and Kissinger said outright, like, you know, it's convinced them were crazy. And then they won't do anything dangerous. Actually, the Soviet Union was never going to do anything dangerous at that stage, but that was the idea. But nobody knows whether this is that kind of bluff. Nobody knows how Putin in particular would carry out that kind of bluff. And it's not as simple as it sounds to call a bluff like that. Yeah. I mean, it is hard to imagine that given the way that this that Putin has framed this war and conducted it, it's just it's hard to imagine that he's going to allow in any way a loss of what he views as anything approaching a loss. And so it's dangerous. And you know, when things are going well for Ukraine, as they did in the first two months of the war and as they have in this last month, they've gone very well for Ukraine, there's so much talk again in this sort of political media class of this is it. Russia's done. There's nothing they can do. They can woof all they want. You know, the only question is, do we take Crimea also? I mean, everything else is already for sure going to be taken, but are we going to take Crimea by force or not? Does Ukraine go in and liberate, you know, the Bashkiri and the Urals and the Tuvans or do they only retake Kuban and Voronezh because that's, you know, ancient Ukrainian roots or something? It's a lot of crazy talk and it's it's pretty well mainstreamed and it's on both sides. I think that's one of the reasons that if Putin is trying to play the crazy nuke guy, it won't work. The United States political elite political elite is much more warlike than the Soviet elite ever was and much more arrogant, really. And they cannot imagine that someone could call their bluff. Yeah. I got to be honest. I don't think he's, I think he is actually a bit of a mad dog. Like I don't think it's a bluff or a game. I really don't. I don't think he's planning on a full scale nuclear holocaust. I think he's calculating that if he uses nuke, that that really genuinely would collapse the European alliance. Like it would split it in several different directions. Could be true. Yeah. Like I think he actually means it and is based on some of his previous features, I think he has decided that you cannot talk to the West at all in the same way we're saying that about him. It's so incredibly dangerous and crazy. But I asked you this, John, and I posted this question on the Radio Warner Facebook page. Did the Soviets, was there an instance where the Soviets didn't like something we were doing? And they threatened nuclear holocaust, nuclear war, in order to get us to change a policy and then we did or did. I can't remember an instance of it. We know that when they put nuke in Cuba, we threatened full scale nuclear war and that got them to pull their nuke out. So that was 62 in 71. I mean, these are the only ones I know off the top of my head in 71. We know from our episodes on the Bangladesh genocide that Kissinger and Nixon decided to, that was, I think, mostly bluff. But it's, you know, to say that if the Soviet, Soviet's got involved on India's side to stop the genocide that the US would bring nuclear weapons and the Soviets did back down, of course. And then again, in 73 in the Yom Kippur War, when the Soviets wanted to bring Soviet troops as peacekeepers to protect the Egyptian Third Army from the Israelis in 73, Kissinger responded by threatening nuclear war and put the US nuclear forces on Defconn. Three, it was, it was crazy. And again, the Soviets backed down and now I'm just wondering, did they have they ever threatened us? Have we ever been threatened by the Russians or the Soviets with a nuclear war? And I don't think we have. Well, it depends on what you mean. There was always the vague apocalyptic threat over that whole world. Yes. So that it hardly seemed necessary in the American public's mind to make an explicit threat. The threat was already there, even if we started it, they would strike back. But yeah, I don't really remember them explicitly saying we're gonna, we're gonna nuke if you do X X. The US said that a lot of times. I mean, extraordinary that the US said that in order to avoid letting a massacre be stopped in Bangladesh. But that was Nixon and Kissinger for you, the dynamic duo. I don't know of a threat like that from the Soviet leadership. No. I mean, yeah, and I, you know, I don't know how that might have worked during the Cold War or not. But this, at least in the post-war period, well, I guess North Korea has kind of, I don't know, North Korea is kind of threatened, I guess, by dint of having nuclear weapons and not giving them up. There's been a lot of Korean threat. North Korea has always been a lot wilder than Soviet rhetoric ever was. Yeah. But this is the first time there's something kind of, you know, certainly a Russian Soviet leader saying over and over again, you know, I will use nukes in this situation. Oh, yeah. And so we see. Yeah. That's true. And we're seeing how the U.S., you know, ruling class, political, least whatever respond to it. And I've got to say it's kind of frightening. They think it's sort of like it's a test, you know? And the way to pass the test is by ignoring it and refusing to acknowledge it as a matter of utmost principle that- Oh, well, that's why I say you can't intimidate them. And I don't mean that to praise them. It would be much better if you could intimidate them, but you can't. Yeah, it's, so I, and for that reason, it's genuinely dangerous. I mean, I don't know. I've never really taken the whole nuclear war thing that seriously. And I don't think if, so if Putin were to demonstratively drop some nukes on Ukraine, I don't think that would start. I don't think the U.S. would respond. I mean, we don't have a treaty with Ukraine. So I don't think the U.S. would respond with nukes. You know, I don't think so, but like it sure creates an incredibly- I don't know. I don't know. New Ukraine as you implied would be a message to Germany. So the U.S. wouldn't have to respond. The Central European public might respond. Yeah. Pretty scary. I mean, I don't know. We have to keep- Well, we do have to keep our eye on that because we have no choice in that wretched war. Why don't we move on from there? So anyway, to sort of sum it up. Yeah, the referendums are coming. The referendums were rushed because, you know, this was another effect. I mean, we talked about the strategic value of or lack thereof of Ukraine taking so much territory up in the north, taking Harkov Oblast back. One of the other things that it accomplished was that it stopped planned referendums from happening. And John, you know, from reading that book, we'll talk about this another time, but that book by the Russian separatist 85 days. 85 days in slow-moans, yeah. You know from that book how important, at least locally, the referendums, it seems kind of strange because you know these referendums are not like very democratic and, you know, they're fixed and so on. But they have some value in the sort of legalistic geopolitical world, a lot of value. And Ukraine really wants to stop them badly from happening. Russia really wants to make them happen. And the Ukrainians in the West, I know, thought that that was really one of the big gains from that war, not just the PR value improving that Ukraine could retake territory, but that they stopped those referendums. And so this was a way of, you know, as Brian would say, like throwing the table, you know, turning over the table, like, okay, we're just going to do the referendums and not even pretend that they're going to be carried out in a sort of orderly democratic fashion. It's just going to be done, stamped, and that's it. Yeah. That's that. So one other war that we wanted to talk about was that really heated up also in the last week or so is the war on Tigray. Yeah, I'll just sum up really briefly what I know of what's happening there. I mean, okay, eight deliveries have not been going through, haven't been going through since August. There's fighting in the South, not on the same A2 road, the big road leading from Tigray to the capital of Ethiopia, but to the West on the, I think, B30 road, which leads to Gondar and the TPLF or TDF, which have you prefer the Tigrayian forces have taken a city on the way to Gondar, but at the same time they were doing this tactical victory, it looks like Ayaratre under Afvarky, it was really the genius, the horrible genius of this war, is moving south into Tigray in a big, big way. And that has been Afvarky's plan from the beginning. And it's amazing that Abiyach Med fell for this. Like Afvarky presented it as, let's do a pincher move on Tigray, you from the south and me from the north. And in fact, Tigray defeated the Ethiopian army and is now involved in this endless war with it. And Afvarky let that war percolate for a while and now he's moving south into Tigray again. So for him, he can't lose, his territory is impregnable and everything to the south is going to be destroyed, both Tigrayian and Ethiopian. So it's really sad and inevitable strategy. Yeah, it's really, really grim. I saw that the Tigrayian forces, you said, they beat back some attacks, some incursions into Tigray and seem to be pushing out from Tigray. Yes, they have now moved south on that road leading to Gondar, they've taken the town of Adi, RK, as James Dal noted recently. And once again, they're able to push back the Ethiopian forces and follow the Amhara ethnic militias. But that just leaves them wide open to air trade attacks from the north. The real world war news is grim as hell. But we have an interview with Brian Train who creates and designs war board games and these are a lot more fun and creative and really interesting as hell. So let's get to our interview with Brian Train. Okay, we are really excited to have with us guest Brian Train. He is a board game designer of war board games and was recommended to us by a member of the Radio Warner community. And he's coming to us from British Columbia, Canada. So first of all, welcome to the show and thanks for coming on, Brian. Thank you so much, Mark. It's great to be here. I know. We're really excited about this and I'm really glad to have been put in touch with you because this is a whole nether genre of war games and I think a lot of people who are interested in anything to do with war and in our community in general, they're into video game, computer games. But a lot of people, you know, you do here into board games as well. And I think there's some cross, there, I think there's some crossover, but the genres are really different. We'll get into all that. So I think the first thing we want to do is if you could tell us a little bit about yourself and how you got into designing board games, war board games or war games that are like physical games rather than, you know, computer ones, you know, and how many you've designed over the years to sort of a general indra. Sure, Mark, thanks. Yeah. So as you noted, I design board war games and I work strictly in analog. I'm not a computer game designer. I have discovered through trial and error. I am the world's worst computer programmer. So that's not really a, and I also do not play computer games. I will very, very rarely play a computer game. So I'm strictly an analog guy. I'm 58 and I've been playing these games since I was about 15 or 16 years old. At that age, this is the late 70s, about seven or eight. My favorite uncle sent me a copy of Tactics 2, which was an old and very basic war game that people often bought to try and introduce people into war gaming. And I took to it right away. And that was 1980 and it got started in that. I didn't start designing these things until about 10 or 11 years later. I was living in Japan from 1990 to 1992. And my gaming collection was on the other side of the ocean. And so I didn't have anything to play, but I wanted to play games. So I just sat down and started making some of my own. And the first two or three games that I designed, I designed to while I was in Japan, one was about, called Powerplay, about a coup d'\u00e9tat, of the plotting and execution of a coup d'\u00e9tat in an imaginary generic country. That was inspired by an old movie about the same topic that had Kidro Tool and Donald Plezins and David Hemings in it. What movie was that? It was called Powerplay. One thing, as we're talking today, one thing that everyone's going to discover is that I'm really bad at inventing game titles. So I'm really unoriginal when it comes to this kind of thing. It's fine because your game titles are very descriptive. It's hard to come up with the game title that will define gaming or something like risk or something like that. But your game titles are great because I know which ones to look at and dive into. Yeah, they're pretty evident of what it is. So yes, Powerplay was one about a coup d'\u00e9tat in a fictional generic country. And the second one I'd designed was called Civil Power, which is a reference to the British military or Commonwealth military term, Aid of the Civil Power, which is when the military is called out to Aid in putting down civil disorder. As I said, I was in Japan and I didn't have any games to play and I also didn't have very many books to read. So there was a Japanese, there's a bookstore in Tokyo that had a collection of English books and they had a mail order catalog. So I ordered up this collection of essays by Hunter S. Thompson, The Great Shark Hunt. Yes. And he probably know it quite well. And one of the pieces in The Great Shark Hunt is an article that he wrote for Scanlan's magazine long ago as Raul Duke, The Master of Weapons. And it was called The Police Chief. And it was this completely unhinged rant about how poorly armed and equipped police departments were to deal with the rabble that was overturning the country and this kind of thing. So I was just inspired by this. So I put together this tactical game. I generally don't work at the tactical level. But I put together this tactical game about making and breaking riots and different forms of civil disorder. And that game I've kept it more or less available through the years. That one's called civil power. Yeah. Did you notice there was a brief revival a few years ago when a lot of street organizing was going on in a kind of medieval combat. Like how to form a cohesive group that could break through police lines. As a matter of fact, that's one thing that I twigged to right away when I was designing this game is the similarities between classic or medieval warfare and fighting when crowds face off against police. And I had an interview with a while back with a website. And we were talking about that actually. And I called up a couple of video clips that I had found of police riots squads when they advance on the crowd. They margin lockstep and they have their batons and they're riot shields and they bang on them and they bang at them. And it's the same thing that the legionaries did. Yeah. I'm certainly flashing the shields. The peelets. Yeah. Yeah. So that was actually one of my inspirations was what some practice that I had had in looking at miniatures rule sets. That's another form of war gaming as miniatures on a tabletop and the rule sets that come with them. They can be very creative. And from what I remembered of rule sets that I played about classical and medieval combat, it helped me to think about how I wanted to put this game about civil power together. So it's a tactical game, but it's also a very generic game. It was, it had its latest publication a year or two ago. And I put in 15 scenarios in it from like the last stand of the Paris commune up to modern riot American city 2020 X. And it's as they call it, we call it a kind of a sandbox game where it's very easy for you to put together a scenario or even to make up new maps to fit a situation. And this just gives you like a framework and some pieces to put a situation together and play it out. So those were the first two that I designed. That was like 1990, 1992. Who did you design them for beside, I mean for yourself clearly, which is always a great way to make sure you're going to do something, you know, that's kind of aesthetically and intellectually more pure, but did they did they get out at all at first or? Well, they were just for me because I didn't even have access to a photo cop here. So my copies were handmade. Right. Wow. And it wasn't until, it wasn't until a few years later that I got in touch with a fellow lived in in Alberta. His name is Carrie Anderson. We had, he was also a game designer and we had an idea of putting it together to make games that were sort of on like desktop publishing quality. So the map was restricted to as big as a laser printer printed back then, which was 11 by 17 inches, fairly short rules and one sheet of counters that you had to stick to a piece of cardboard yourself and cut them out. And we made this, we called this the micro game co-op and actually we started calling it the micro game co-op because it was just a collusion of of Carrie as the designer and publisher and me and some other guys as designers. And it was a co-op because we were a working publishing company that was nonprofit by design and not by outcome, which made us different. And because we just charge people basically would have cost to print these things and to send it to them through the mail. And we turned out like 40 titles in eight years. And as I said, we started off as the micro game co-op, but Carrie ran into a bit of a hassle from the Alberta provincial government because they're the word co-op refers to an agricultural co-op and you can't use that term unless you've got a board of directors and bylaws and grow wheat or something like that. There's an unexpected wrinkle in the... Yes, Carrie was very surprised to get that communication from the Alberta provincial government. And so we invented, we had to rename ourselves the micro game design group and that's how we finished up the business. And that was about 1995 or so. And by then I had designed a few other games, designed ones on current events and some historical ones. Two that I had designed about that time was one on Somalia and the intervention then in the mid-90s. And another one on Sendera Luminoso, which was something that was still bubbling away down in Peru when I put that game together. We still have to do this in Sendera Luminoso, John. That's an investment to be done. Yes, absolutely do. Crazy stuff. Well, just today I ordered Brian's game on another story that we're going to have to get into, the French Algerian War, 1954 to 1962. And actually this game has a very poetic title, colonial twilight. And I'm really looking forward to playing this because I know a lot of our listeners are big game players. But as I've said before to Mark, Brian, the one time Mark tried to get me started on call of duty. All I was supposed to do was just climb down the rope to the floor and I'm honest to God. I fell off the rope and broke my neck 40 times in a row. A lot of bumps and bruises there. So I gather this has no coordination, right? You don't need no, no, no, no, it's, and it's much the same with me. I mean, my wife, she doesn't play very many computer games. She tried to play an old one called Stubz the Zombie once and she had her zombie and she couldn't get him out of a corner. He walked into a, she walked him into a corner and he couldn't get out. And that was kind of the end of the game. Stubz the zombie. It's an old one for the nighties or something. That's my kind of zombie. Yeah. And I'm not, I'm not any good at these things as well, you know, these computer games, like the real time games or anything like that. There's just simply too much going on. So I really like the mental exercise, of course, of designing these things, putting them together. It's a lot of work. Right. And it's, it's systems thinking, really, it's systems design and systems thinking. And there's an awful lot of work involved. And it's a great creative outlet and it helps me, you know, to think. And even the, even the task of writing game rules is a very exacting form of technical writing. And, you know, it's, it's something that, that really helps. I think in, in, helps people to think about how they're thinking. And of course, you have to try and make it interesting for people too. Because, you know, I, I think I, I designed for myself first and a market later because there's little to no money to be made in any of these things. But for me, it's always been a, that surprises me. There's no money. Well, because it's a really small market, it always has been a really small market. Board War gaming as a hobby peaked in the early 1980s. And it was a time when you had, you know, probably a couple hundred thousand people. And it was, you know, a lot of people involved in it, mostly in the United States. But the main magazine, like the main company that was turning out the, the largest number of war games then was a game company called SPI or Simulations Publications. They had a magazine called Strategy and Tactics, which is still in print today. But back then they had a press run in the early 80s of about 30 to 35,000 copies. And it was a bi-monthly. As I said, the, the magazine is still in print today, but the press runs are, of course, much, much smaller. There was a big market correction in the 80s where there was a big shakeout of these publishing companies because they weren't very good at doing business. And also personal computers came along and really supplanted a lot of, you know, they were quicker and faster for people to play. And there was less time and space involved. And of course, a lot of the people who were playing these things in the early 80s, by this time they were, they were leaving university and they were getting kids and careers and all this kind of thing. So they had very little spare time. Now, I'm 58, so I was kind of on the trailing edge of that. But there are people, you know, who have always been in this, you know, 10, 20 years older than I, who have always been in the hobby. And they've seen it, you know, kind of come and go. But then the internet came along in the late 90s and rescued it because these isolated gamers and groups of gamers could communicate with each other and start to communicate and put, put conventions back on. There were gaming related websites came along like Consum World, board game geek has a big board game community in it. Of course, although it's mostly about ordinary board games. And of course, there was the phenomenon of the PDF file, which allowed print and play. So that a lot of my games, for example, are available as a set of print and play files. You just download it and then you print things out and you have to go to the work of putting the thing together like sticking stuff to cardboard and, you know, piecing the map together. But you know, for a tiny fraction of the cost and maybe a little bit more expenditure in time, you have a functioning game. So let me get to a couple of war games that board games. Well, one that every Warner, it's foundational should have played or knows about, which is risk. And I played a lot of that. John played a lot of that. Even the Johnson's not much of a war gamer, but played risk a lot. Risk figures big in the whole Gary Brecher, John Dolan. Absolutely. I was serious about risk. Yeah, me too. And I was very, very upset when I lost a risk. Yeah. I mean, I've only seen, I never played D&D. I was like too isolated to play D&D. I didn't even know any other nerds to play D&D with. But I saw later on when I got socialized, I saw how much this meant to people like one guy whose half-elf got killed in a game. I mean, he was pretty macho, dude in some ways. And he cried. He cried in front of other 20-something guys. And that was a big shock to me. I saw how much it meant. I think D&D is probably a bit more personal, even than some of the war games. That could be wrong. But anyway, another game, and I also remember when risk went to nuclear risk. Do you remember that? They added, but it didn't really fit or work to it. I don't know if either of you remember nuclear risk. Because it encouraged dummies like me to just go straight for nooking as quickly as you could. Yeah. There have been a lot of variations on risk that came over the years. Nuclear risk is one of them zombie risk. And, you know, just this kind of thing going on. Risk is the one that everybody kind of starts out with. Right. And, you know, it's, I don't know, a lot of people just discover, you know, the basic strategy is just grab Australia, get all of Australia, deliver everyone else wears themselves out, and then imagine conquer the world. It's a great introduction, but it's still just a game. Yeah, it's different. Here's an interesting factoid for you. Apparently the person who risk is originally a French game. And it was designed by the, I cannot remember his name right now, but he is the film director who directed the red balloon. Really? Wow. I remember seeing that as a little kid about the real. I have to see that in school. I have to see that in school. It was like a big art film that you could show in social studies. Yes. Or whatever. Yeah. And grammar school. That's wild. And then the next game that, and we talked about this a little when we sort of did our pre-talk yesterday, but game that meant a lot to me as a kid, but I couldn't do much with it was one, one day, sometime in the 70s, I think it was like towards the late 70s, in the middle, middle, I can still remember the condo that my dad lived in at the time is after. The divorce brought over this board game, Arab Israeli Wars. And I was cut, I was into chess at that time with my dad. And this here it took war gaming to this very, a lot more complex level. And you had different weapon systems that had different values. One value would be how effective it would be, one value would be sort of, you know, how much it could defend, one value would be how much it could move. If I remember right roughly like that. And then you had a map with these hexagon squares. And then you had to kind of set up, you know, your forces against the, it was, I think it was based on the 1973 the Yom Kippur War, if I remember right. And I remember it was just blown away by this game. And then I couldn't get anybody to ever play with me again. So I, you know, as boys do, I played by myself, so to speak, like a lot. Every time I was visiting my dad's, I don't know how I played by myself. You know, I don't remember how you make it interesting, but somehow it kept me very interesting. The one thing I still sort of remember about the equipment was that the Israeli jets were so much more advanced or I gave you so much more kind of relative power over the Arab armies who had numbers. But the, but the air power was a really big deal in that game. If I remember right, the tanks were also important, but the air power was where the real difference was. But do you remember that game? The Arab Israeli Wars? Yes. And as a matter of fact, one of the first war games that I ever saw was Panzer Leader, which is a game published by the same company that was published just a couple of years before Arab Israeli wars. And it was the same kind of game, well, except it was about the Western Front in World War II. And it came a few years after the very first in that family came called Panzer Blitz, which is one of the, you know, probably one of the more common titles, you know, probably more have been printed of that than many other games. And that was East Front combat. Arab Israeli wars was the last one of that particular series of tactical games. And it came out in I think 77 or 78. I'm sure somebody out there will set me right on that. And it was interesting because again, this was a tactical game. And it was sort of sandbox because you remember the maps that you put together were just generic ones of, you know, sand dunes and hills and sand dunes. Right. And of course, the Suez Canal. Yes. Because that was a big feature of the war, the 73 war. Yes. But they had scenarios from 1956 and 1967 wars and even some hypotheticals. What was interesting about the game is, as you say, the way the different weapons systems worked with and against each other, but also how the game emphasized quality. And it was what we call the soft factors in warfare. So it's not just about, you know, the optics on your tank main gun and how accurate it is. It's also things like training and crew quality and stuff like that. So the like the Arab Israeli wars had one role mechanism in it that the other two in the system didn't have. And that was morale. And you remember that the Israeli forces were usually like morale A, which means when they got disrupted or confused, you know, by being shot up in combat, they would recover from it very quickly. But most of the Arab forces were like quality C and D, right. What means they would take a longer time, you know, to recover from being disrupted like that. And that's the sort of thing that you really look for as a game designer is because as you know, you're going to have to be able to do it. And that's the beginning of the work is doing the research because the next thing you have to do is you have to figure out how to model this in a way that shows your work that does, that is, gives it an effect that's proportional to what happened historically or should have happened historically could have happened. And in a streamlined way where you don't have people, you know, throwing the die and checking constantly these little things, that's a real fault with a lot of games is. And this, you know, games in the 1980s, for example, were really bad for this kind of thing because they had 40 and 50 page rulebooks and pages and pages of charts and things to check and you're always looking something up a rolling dice. Nowadays things generally are a lot more streamlined. Right. There's a lot more thought going into it. But it's very easy to do. It's easier to design a game like that than one that's very clean. On the other hand though, if you have something that is too clean, too slick, it becomes almost incomplete. Right. So it's a question of, you build your game and then you go through a phase of productive synthesis to the point where it still says what you wanted to, but there is nothing more to be taken away. But just when you hit that point is really hard. It's really hard to identify. Yeah. Well, let's, can we, I don't know if, well, you know what, first, I want to actually try and go through a little bit with you, like the structure of a game a little bit, not, you know, too deeply, but just in general, so that people who haven't played games before would have maybe a little better sense of what we're talking about. But I also want to talk about all these great games you have. Maybe we should talk a little bit more about the games and then we'll get into the mechanics of one of the games. So like, for example, here, I mean, you have, I just wanted to list off some of the, you know, just to give people a sense of the variety here. I mean, you have several games, well, you have a couple of games on battle for China. So that would be from World War II, right? Yeah. The Sino-Japanese War, which we know so little, you know, here in the West, it's at least we know very little about that part of the war. We, at Radio Warner, we interviewed Chinese American polymath, Carl Zah, about some of these wars in there huge and amazing stuff, and we just don't know much about it. So this is for people who really know their wars. You have a few games or variations of games on the 2006 Israeli-Hesbalah War or gaming a third, like a follow-up war to that, which I think is really interesting. And there's even a Cyprus game. Yeah. Yoka, yeah. Yeah. Which is great. We just finished our series on Turkey's 1974 invasion, but we did a whole deep background on Yoka's anti-colonial war against the Brits and so on. Kandahar, Korean War battles, Ukraine crisis, which you did, you put that out, I think, you told me very quickly after the Russian annexation of Crimea, right? So back in 2014, this game has surely blown up. Is that game popular, by the way? Are you Kremlin? That's a free one you can download, and it's cool. Yeah. Well, that game is an example of very rapid game design. I designed that game literally in 48 hours over the weekend in March that the referendum, quote unquote, was held by people of the Crimea about rejoining Russia. And so within 48 hours, I had put together a game that was, had political military and, well, let's call it informational operations, all blended into it. And I had come up with a game that was fairly simple, you know, played quickly. And above all, things, you could play the game without anybody ever actually going to war. It was a war game where you didn't have to go to war. And I designed this, as I said, in March 2014. And at a time when it looked like an overt Russian, an overt large scale Russian invasion was going to be very, very likely. And so I put it together very quickly and I put it up on my website and it got a tremendous amount of hits the next week because, you know, the internet just spreads things. So this game called Ukrainian crisis. Suddenly everybody was, I'd found out about this and they were clicking in and they would click in and they would find out, oh, it's not a computer game. I have to download the files and print them out and, oh, I have to stick things. I have to find someone else to play it with. And so anyway, thousands of people, you know, popped in, clicked on it and clicked away again as fast as they could. It's still one of the most popular items on my website. It's a free game. And as I said, it's been available for some time. It has been published, was published properly in 2017, given a very nice presentation. But again, it's a game that refers, it fits best for the situation in 2014 from the time of the referendum through to about six months later when they had the first mince protocol. And things were, the conflict was kind of suspended at that point and the likelihood of a Russian invasion, you know, seemed to have receded. And so that was 2014 and the game is suited for that. It's not suited at all to the situation we have right now in 2022. Are you thinking about designing an updated Ukraine game? No, no. No, it's the kind of game. Well, you know, like Mark wrote very eloquently on Facebook and the radio war nerd group about how he had been blindsided by events and I have to confess, it blindsided me too. And all I could think of when people were asking me about a 2022 scenario, you know, for my game and that kind of thing, really the game that I designed is not, you know, could not really be used in good conscience. I mean, you could use the map because the map is the same, but everything else would have been different. So effectively, 2022 represented a game of 2014 Ukrainian crisis that ended in a Russian table flip. Right. Because, you know, they had either they had thoroughly lost the war on the information front and on the diplomatic front. And so they just do a table flip. That's a great way to put it over invasion. Yeah. And that's the only thing that explains it. I went through kind of the same thing last year with a distant plane, which is a game I co-designed with Volko Runka on Afghanistan. Volko and I put this game together in 2012 and it was published in 2013. And the game at the time covered the initial, you know, NATO, NATO intervention, you know, like 2003 and it ran up to was supposed to run up to about 2014, which was the scheduled time for NATO to end its combat mission in in Afghanistan. And so we designed it and it sold really well, continues to sell really well. But then, of course, when everything fell apart last summer, people were saying, oh, well, you know, how come your game didn't predict this? Or what do I need to do to put together a scenario in your game, you know, to mirror what's happening, you know, now in 2021? And you know, the answer is pretty simple. Number one, you know, we did not mean for it to predict anything. And we were very careful to talk about this, both of us in our designers' notes and the playbook that comes with the game, which is again, a lot of historical commentary and, you know, exposition about why we designed things the way we did and how things, you know, come together in the game and how we view them coming together. So we were very careful to say, look, you know, these games don't have much of a predictive ability. They're not meant to be crystal balls. What they are meant to be is when they're on a contemporary or hypothetical subject, they're a way of exploring the problem space as it were, so that you can see how a problem, you know, how an issue, how a conflict could develop and you can kind of explore different things. But often there are things that happen that are like meta events and large, very large adjustments that go on way, way outside the framework of the game itself. And, you know, when that happens, the game doesn't become, it's not a useful instrument anymore. So between 2014, which is the end of the period covered by, you know, our Afghanistan game, and 2021, you have several huge political adjustments and policy adjustments and all these things that combine to give you a completely different setting. And of course, a complete collapse of morale on the part of the coalition and the government of Afghanistan. So, in effect, it's as if people were playing along, you know, a very reduced version of the game and suddenly the coalition player says, stands up and says, well, look, I'm sorry, the last bus is at 1030 and I got to be on it. And this is my copy of the game. So we got to pack up, you know, so he starts shoveling stuff into the box, you know, and cram in the lid back on the box because he's going to make us. And meanwhile, you know, the government player is not really all that interested in playing either. So these kinds of games, you know, that a sudden and catastrophic collapse of morale that we saw last year wasn't part of the mechanism of that, of that game. Now I've designed a family of about five or six games where there is the main currency in the game is kind of like a generalized political support level from one side or the other. And it goes up and down, you know, for a whole variety of reasons. But when one side reaches zero, when there's support bottoms out, that reflects that kind of catastrophic collapse of morale or ability or interest or support by the people, you know, it depends on the game situation. And that's the end of the game. It's over and lost, you know, you zeroed out. And that's kind of what happened there. Right. And that kind of game that was designed to reflect a different situation. And you know, there's going to be an awful lot of post mortems about the Afghanistan, you know, this last Afghanistan war. But even though, you know, you say it's not meant to be predictive, nevertheless, your games have caught the attention of military universities, teachers, planners. I mean, you've been invited. And clearly they have some value in training thinking about scenarios. And I mean, I think your specialty is kind of counterinsurgency, but other scenarios as well, right? Yeah. Oh, they absolutely do, Mark. And, you know, as I said, I've been doing this for about 30 years. And it wasn't until about maybe, you know, maybe less than 15 years ago, I started to get any kind of notice from the professional military or even the academic community. So it's kind of like a, there was a very long apprenticeship, you know, 15 or 20 years before anything got moving in that end. And it was something that I never, you know, I never intended, you know, to get into this sort of thing. As I said, you know, this sort of thing is a creative outlet for me. And it's a way for me to do my research and learn about history, to model it and to make sense of it in, you know, in something that works for me personally. And I'm very happy to share it with people, you know, for free or, you know, a very low price. And, you know, I'm just pleased with that. Can you tell us a little bit about some of the work you have done for military or what they've tapped into? Yeah. I guess the first time I got involved in that kind of thing was in 2007. I got an email from someone who was working in the office of the Secretary of Defense at the time. And he was talking, he talked to me about a game that I had designed on the French Hell, Jerry and War. This is not the one that John was talking about. Colonial Twilight. Yeah. Colonial Twilight is one that I designed in 2016, 2017. The one that I'm talking about is just called Algeria. And I designed it in 2000. And it was the first game as far as I could tell in any language on the French Hell, Jerry and War. Because, you know, in 2000, even that the whole question of the war is kind of a taboo or kind of an ab, it's notable by its absence, you know, in French politics and education. Yeah. Well, French discourse doesn't quite allow for the level of enthusiastic war, nerdery that Anglo culture does. Yeah, that's true. Yes. Yeah. No, there's definitely that culture. But there's also kind of like this empty space, you know, and yet it's affected and, you know, really poised in French politics and society ever since the 1960s. And yet it's something that, you know, isn't, I mean, there's a little bit more openness about the subject now, but 20 years ago, it was still something. I mean, I think in 2000, the French government had barely even acknowledged the war as a war. Right. So it was still, you know, kind of a minority topic at the time. Anyway, this particular game had drawn this guy's attention in its depiction of the FLN insurgency against the French. And he had taken the game's mechanisms and he was using it an adaptation of them for his game, you know, for people in the office of the cigarette date of defense of his little little corner of it as a model for the insurgency that was going on in Iraq at the time. And he asked me, you know, there's going to be a meeting of the military operations research society, which is an association of operations research analysts and people like that who work for the military. And they're doing a, you know, like a workshop on irregular warfare. Because again, this is 2007. And the American army had just put out their manual, field manual 324 on counter insurgency. And what I like to attend, you know, and see what he'd done. And boy, would I, so I went there. And this was at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey. And I was amazed to see that to meet people there who knew me, knew my work and had been using my work and adapting it for their own particular professional and semi professional purposes. So very collegial, very friendly. And I was just so pleased to find out that that my work had, you know, had at least inspired them to do something else, something a little bit different, you know, in their line of work as well. And you do something that you're doing because of your love for it or because you feel compelled. Something, something crazy in you, like sort of pushes you to do it, like the way you got into your early board gaming, you know, it's surprising to find out that people actually know who you are and appreciate it, you know, that they're in the outside world. I just, I was surprised when I got back here after the exile was shut down to find out how many people had read the exile. I had no idea because we were in our tiny little bunker, you know, putting out this, this rag until until they found us and I was surprising. So and it's gratifying, you know, it's a great feeling. So not long after that, I started attending this annual conference called Connections and there's an Air Force Colonel, he's retired now. And he started doing this annual conference called Connections in 1993 and its intention is of course to make connections between the civilian end of gaming, you know, usually war gaming because these are military people and the professional military gaming community. But there's also business gaming, emergency response gaming, you know, hospital, send, make health agencies and FEMA people like that, they all do exercises, they also do planning and things that are very much like games as they don't always call them games, but they are like that. So this conference has been going on every year for 30 years almost and it now has Canadian, British, Australian and even Dutch franchises that have peeled off from it. And it's all about building connections and just getting people to cross fertilize their ideas with each other. And you know, I have these ideas, I have this, I have a need to come up with some kind of a game or simulation that explores this problem. How would you tackle it this way? So this was great, this is great introduction, you know, for me to meet other people in the professional military community and in the academic community, you know, who were, you know, kind of working, who knew of my work and we're kind of working along the same lines. This is something that I was really interested in because I've been looking at some of your games now and I'm coming at this as someone who knows nothing, absolutely nothing about gaming. And just looking at your one of your simplest games, Gorilla checkers, which I think was designed to be really simple. You, there's a note, an italicized note where you say, with competent play, the counterinsurgency player will often lose. And if you, I mean, that's, that's how it works out. Most counterinsurgency's fail. So what was that a problem when you were talking to the military about this? Did they want you to cheer up the game a little bit? No, not really. That's, that's a really good question. And I'm glad that you mentioned Gorilla checkers, John, because that is the simplest game I have ever designed among my 60 or so, you know, published designs. And it's the one that I'm probably most proud of because it is so simple. The I got the idea for it when I was working on a game about the counterinsurgency in Canada, our province back in 2010. And I was lying awake in the middle of the night, you know, like middle-aged men will staring at the ceiling. And for once I wasn't thinking about how bad a person I've been in my life or what I would do is the roof started to leak. For once I was thinking about this game that I was working on with these other people. And I thought, okay, in Afghanistan, you have the two forces, you know, the two main, you know, antagonists to simplify it. And they treat the physical terrain and the human terrain completely differently, even though they're occupying the same space at the same time. They look at it in completely different ways and they go about it in completely different ways. And I thought, what I need is I need to put together a very simple abstract game that where both sides are playing effectively different games on the same board at the same time with the same objective of neutralizing the other. And so I just got the idea. And it's, you know, basically it's just a mashup of checkers and go. And I was surprised to see that no one else had really thought of this kind of thing before. And again, this is, you know, my simplest game and the one that I'm most proud of. But your question, John, cuts right to the difference, the big major difference between civilian gaming and professional military gaming or war gaming for professional military education. The thing is, is that the people in professional military people, they're interested in what's going on now. They're interested in contemporary military events. They study history, they study campaigns and wars of the past for what they can teach, for what they have to teach them about what's going on now. And in the civilian world, so many of my games are about contemporary conflicts, but they're very, very much a minority interest because I came to the conclusion pretty quickly that while all civilian war gamers are interested in history, and many of them have incredible knowledge of certain periods of history, you know, in the American Civil War or whatever, by and large, proportionately, they're not much more interested in current events than people who don't play war games. And so the kind of games that I design on, on contemporary conflicts and issues, they're a minority interest within the hobby itself. They don't sell all that well. Just not that many people who are interested in it. But I noticed that when I was looking at reviews of your games, somebody who ended up being really enthusiastic about the game, about colonial twilight, opened his review by saying, okay, I've resisted counterinsurgency games for a really long time. And it's bizarre, but there's something that's depressing about counterinsurgency, whereas, you know, if you were on the field at Gettysburg on July 5th, it would have been a pretty depressing side. But somehow gaming that battle doesn't depress people. Yeah. Yeah. I know, because there's a narrative attached to it, you know, depending on what your predilections are, you know, you're rooting for one side or the other, but there's a narrative, and of course it's tied into, you know, American history and American popular culture, in a way that, you know, the war in Afghanistan isn't at least not yet. And so that's the, but the dichotomy here is that a civilian war game, it has to be produced as something that people will pick up and play. So it has to have us, you know, like a modicum of balance and it has to be entertaining. But with the professional gamers, professional military people, they don't care so much about whether something is a balanced contest. I mean, you know, a professional military man, you know, a general doesn't want to fight fair. No, one of my friends. Yeah. The last thing you want is to roll the dice and, and, you know, and have a 50% chance to success. You want to load the dice. You want to unbalance the situation as much as possible. So they're more interested in, well, I don't want to say very similar to it, but they wanted to, I think they're interested in a lucid exploration and waiting of what the factors in a hypothetical combat or contemporary conflict are. They're looking more for honesty and not for balance and certainly not for entertainment. Now, there are lots of examples of, of, you know, professional military officers using these games as, you know, ways to help them think about things. There were quite a few cases, for example, of people from units from both the American and British armies that I knew of personally, where they asked for copies from the publisher for copies of a distant plane before their battalions deployed to Afghanistan. And, you know, okay, this was not in the line of, of really professionally preparing them, you know, in the sense of, you know, briefings and that kind of thing. But it was a way for the people to explore just how complicated a conflict it was because that game is, that game is for four people. And that's a horrible simplification of what was actually going on in Afghanistan. But even for a game, it's quite complex in terms of the relationships, the rules of the game are not all that complex, but the play between the players can become very, very layered and very complex. And they said, okay, we found this to be really valuable in trying to put together, to put across to people in a very, you know, in a gut level way, just how complicated things were in what they're going into, you know. And so the idea wasn't to reduce everything to the level of a, of a bored game, you know, because in our culture, we tend to treat these things as trivial exercises, just as we treat all forms of play, anything that happens to be called play as a trivial exercise. But instead, just to try and teach people just what, what a complex, you know, maze they were, they were walking into. Right. And, you know, there seems to be this assumption, or that there's a paradox between unpleasant issues and fun gameplay that's that's unresolvable. And I don't think this is necessarily so. I mean, I've designed these games on contemporary and modern counterinsurgencies and, you know, colonial twilight, for example, is that's a war that saw a lot of very cruel, you know, horrendously cruel and painful action by both sides. And it's trying to be as honest as possible, you know, in game form, a reflection of actual history. And, you know, I think you can find games that are about unpleasant issues, but are still fun to play, you know, regular board games, for example, there's lots of games on the Black Death. There's a game called PlayGain Corporated, which is, you know, it came out as, I think it's a computer game, it's got like 85 million players. Right. And it came out as a board game later. And it was actually the one game that I managed to get my wife to play with me during lockdown. You know, before this scrabble was her game and still is, but I did manage to get her to sit down and play and play and incorporate it with me. Wow. It is the plague of player there. Do you put it as a bacillus? Yes, you are. You are a, you, the game handles, I think, up to five players and you are the plague. Wow. You're a form of plague and you kind of mutate yourself as you go. So as I said, you know, the guy who designed this, it was a computer game first and it was fantastically popular as a computer game and he came out with a board game version of it later. It doesn't sell as well, but it's still quite a popular title. During the lockdown, I felt it was kind of a moral duty to read Kamu's The Plague. And I, I, I said to people after that, like, I think that's the only boring book on a plague that's ever been written. I mean, everything else anybody ever wrote about a plague right after the stand. That was fun too. Lots of plague, lots of people. Yeah. Yeah. Things can be horrible and make good games. I was the same John. I started to read the plague and I, I dropped it and I read the outsider again. Yeah, I'm glad it wasn't just me, you know, it's one of those things where I'm, as, am I funding this boring because I'm intellectually, and I always ask myself that. No, it's just boring, not as best book. So let's go over a game, a bit of a game, a bit of an outline of one of the games so that people can get a sense of how these are structured and also how much kind of fun and you can inject into a game. I mean, I, the one I, I'm choosing here is the Battle of Seattle. Just like, when I saw that you had, you know, among all these grim counterinsurgencies and wars, the battles yet, like I immediately started laughing. And then I looked through more descriptions from your web page. We're going to put up, you know, links to your web page for your games. I saw that your second game as you already told us was based on an old Hunter Thompson article, Rale Duc article where he's going totally bad shit, crazy, you know, calling basically all the police chiefs of America, a bunch of pinkos because they're not armed well enough and so on, right? I mean, so here's the Battle of Seattle. And you put this out not long after the, so that was in 1999, the anti-IMF, anti-World bank anti sort of free trade protests that people might remember. I wasn't at that, I wasn't rush at that time, but I was at the very large protest a few months later in, I don't know, I want to say maybe it was, it was April May of 20, of 2000. Yeah, April or May of 2000, I think it was. Yeah, of 2000 in Washington, DC. And that was the first time I have to say that I used to like going to protest. I wasn't even oftentimes four or against really what they were for. I just, when I grew up in the barrier, I like going to protest, you know, they're thrilling to watch and to almost get stomped on and so on. That's just that when I was a young idiot, that's what I did. San Francisco cops, I remember were a lot scarier than you would think if you have this idea of San Francisco as, oh, hippie, hippie liberal city, they're pretty mean and rough. Berkeley cops were kind of all over the place, but the cops in DC, and then I had been at many protests in Russia, like John, you were with me at the, you know, at the Grznyz Delta. Yeah, they all won March in the Grznyz Delta, Ojdansk, I hope, or on, yeah. And I was at several more, I mean, I was there when Yeltsin was bombing his own parliament building, the White House. But I hadn't seen anything like the 2000, like the different police forces in the 2000 protests. Most of the people protesting, there was a black block contingent, you know, anarchist contingent. But most of them were pretty, well, you do a really good job here and we'll get into it. I think what you'd call liberals, like regular college students, liberals, people were, you know, concerned about the issue, not, not activists in every other way, but really activists in this particular issue. There were interest groups, unions, but the police, like I just remember, faint lenses of cops with like brand new shiny, I don't know, fiberglass armor. And they march in line like the Romans, as you said, they march so that their boots all, you know, went like jackboots stepping in motion in line, hitting their shields or hitting the thigh guards, the sort of the fiberglass thigh guards with their trunchens as they march, like a frickin, you know, Roman Legion marching band. And, you know, black and visor, black and visors on their helmets. I found them scarier than a lot of these, a lot of the kids did. I was like, I thought after Russia, I'd have been tougher, but I hadn't seen anything like it. Maybe they had. So I found it pretty damn intimidating. And anyway, that's just my little background here, but I want to get to your game. So first of all, you dedicated to the violence in the streets. That's a cool dedication. Your introduction here, I just want to read out a little bit of this, but the introduction, so the battle Seattle is a simulation of the popular demonstrations against the World Trade Organization talks held in Seattle from November 30th to December 3rd, 1999. In the game, one player representing the protesters attempts to disrupt the WTO meetings and draw attention to the anti-free trade cause, while the other player representing the Seattle civic authorities, basically the various, you know, police forces, tries to contain the disruption. The rules here are very clear, by the way. This is like a totally doable game because some of your games are more complex. But if you play, the way I look at it, if you play a game like this one, the battle Seattle and it's really fun and all the pieces here are just hilarious, then you kind of have, I think as you've said before, you start to get a sense of the structure of war games so that it's not as hard. It's not like you're going into Ukrainian crisis or, you know, the third Lebanon war, totally blind. Like you have a sense of how these things work if you start with an easier one. So the game components here, the two main components you have, 96 counters, a map of downtown Seattle which has these like various connections between hexagons and circles. And then you, right, and each counter, which is like, what would you describe a counter as? Each one of them is rated for combat factor on the left side. So you have a number there between, like let's say, one in six, morale factor in the middle and movement factor on the right. So you counter, I'm just going to read this off and I'm going to post some pictures. But like it could be, you know, Michael Moore, which is so funny, it could be a policeman raising his trunch and he looks like a South Park. He looks like Terrence and Philip kind of, but like raising a trunch and, you know, so he has a four for combat factor, a four for morale factor and a three for movement factor. Then you have a Barney Fife Don Nost, who is, I guess that would be the state troopers. Is that right? Is Bar, who's the state troopers here? I think so, yeah. Oh, yeah. So that's three, five, three. Then you have goofy as the National Guard. It's got to be goofy. Yeah. Yes. Right. So basically you, and my wife actually printed these out for me on a, on a color printer. So it looks great. So you print this out, you print out the counters. There are 96 of them. And then what you kind of glue a piece of cardboard on the back and then you have a sort of one of those like, like long handle people, paper cutters or what's the best way to do that? Um, well, this is a great example of what I was talking about earlier as a print and play game. You can get a copy of this game for free on my website. You just click on the files and download them and then print them out. And as it's just as you say, with putting the counters together, if you happen to have, you can buy these things that are sticky labels and it's like one, like the whole page is one sticky label. You can get them at stationary stores and that's a good way to do it. Because then you print it out onto that sticky label and then you stick it onto a piece of cardboard. Then you cut it out. It's probably best to use, you know, like an exacto knife or a box cutter with a steel ruler or if your wife is a crafter type, steal a rotary cutter from her work basket. This is a thing that looks like a pizza cutter. You can get them at Michaels or Hobby Lobby or whatever. Yeah, they give you really nice, nicely shaped counters. But yeah, these counters, in this case, they're, it's a little square of cardboard, you know, about half three quarters of an inch square. And it has an image on it. You get people will see the images when you upload it and it's got some numbers on it. Sometimes they have more numbers. Sometimes they have fewer. But this one, as things go, is, is, is pretty simple. Yesterday we were talking, and I was talking about this idea I had about games and game design as a form of, of citizen journalism or amateur journalism. And Ukraine crisis is, is an example of one of those that I put together in like a couple of days. Battle of Seattle is probably the earliest one that I've put together, you know, where it came out fairly soon after the event. I live in Victoria, which is about 100 miles north of Seattle. So this was going on quite close to me at the time. I was sitting at home with a broken leg. So, you know, even if I'd wanted to go down and participate, I couldn't have. But I watched what was going on and I read all the press coverage about it. And then I thought, hmm, there's maybe, you know, the germ of a game in here. So within about a month, I had put together, you know, and tested and developed the game. And it's pretty much, you know, then it's pretty much the same game. It is now over 20 years later. And I started with the idea of, well, it's like, I, you know, designing a game is like almost any other kind of creative act, you know, a sculpture or painting novel, short story, what have you. You start by blocking out in general. What are the things that you want the work, the creative work? What do you want it to say and how do you want it to say it? And you just, and of course you go from the larger block of ideas and then you, you know, proceed down to finer and finer grain and finer focus. So what I wanted in this, what I wanted this game to show was I wanted to show it, you know, the basic, the basic confrontation between, you know, the anti-free trade side on one side and the other side that was trying to preserve order in Seattle, but also to preserve in a larger sense the, you know, the order, the way things are in the world as opposed to the way people think they should be. And so what was important in this game, what was important to winning, quote unquote, in this game was the idea of an exposure index. So during the game, the play of the game, both sides have an exposure index, which goes up and down for different reasons. So what this represents in the game is the amount of favorable publicity and sort of, well, call it image leverage that a side has. So in a sense, it's a measure of how close one player or the other is to winning the battle, not in a physical sense quite, but in the sense of everybody in the eyes of everybody else who happens to be watching and taking notes. So I think that's brilliant. And I think that's, that's maybe the most important difference between designing games like this and designing games like risk or some are really playing of the Eastern front in, in 1944, where the end of the game is the annihilation of one, well, of everybody but the winning player. Because 21st century wars don't generally happen like that. They, they work more like metal fatigue and in a place like Afghanistan or Algeria, the side that loses finally just gets worn down and tired of it. But yeah, for example, in the Battle of Seattle, the authorities, the defenders of the order could have brought in a division of tanks and just killed everybody on the opposite side. But they're not quite allowed to do that. But they are still allowed more violence than the protesters are. So yeah, there's a strange modulation. Yeah. And really, that is kind of the central concept in the game is this idea about the exposure index and about how, you know, sides, the two sides in a game, you know, they win, but in a largely non-material way. And that is something that doesn't always, you know, even though everybody acknowledges that defeat is something that takes place in the mind of the enemy, games don't always mirror that very well. And so the exposure index, like the ideas and sort of the implications of this exposure index, they are permeated through the other mechanisms in the game. So the more that the higher your exposure index goes, the better you have more freedom of movement. You have more freedom to react to enemy, to the enemy's moves. So you can, so you can, you can react better to what the other guy is doing in the middle of what he, you know, in the middle of him doing it as a matter of fact, which is very powerful. As your exposure goes up and down, both sides are continually reinforced during the game. Depending on where your exposure index goes, as it goes up or down, the nature of your reinforcement changes. So for example, when the protester exposure index goes up, they get more crowd units. Yeah, there's two types of units. There's crowd units, which are like large, you know, protest marchers, you know, like organized labor and environmentalists and stuff like that. So those are very large crowd units, but there are also small group units, which are a smaller groups of much more committed people. So this is like your black block and your anarchists and your Yahoo's, you know, where people came in from the suburbs, just to smash windows and stuff like that. So as the exposure index for the protester goes up, they get more crowd units as a reinforcement and fewer group units. But if their exposure index is driven down, then they're becoming radicalized and they get more group units and fewer crowd units because the people who are less committed to the cause stay home because they see, you know, the violence to see that they're losing out. And it's the same for the authority. As their exposure index goes up, they actually start losing reinforcements because the cops who are out there on the street are being released, you know, back to normal patrol duty. And so, you know, the better you're doing, then people start, you know, the police headquarters starts taking people away from you. Oh, you're doing so well. Well, you know, let me, let me take these platoons back, you know, because they got to go patrol capital hill. So that's, you know, that's, that's an example of how you can make this central concept and kind of work it into the different mechanisms of the game itself. I wonder if there's a way of designing a game that would allow for Harble as it sounds, the exploitation of atrocity, like putting someone on your side in a dangerous position with the cameras ready so that, you know, they could, their, their death could be effective in, in a larger sense. Yes. I haven't designed anything that is quite that explicitly. But, you know, again, there are, you know, I suppose you could say that that sort of testing could be implied. Right. I was going to say there's a, like even in this game, for example, authority loses one exposure point when authority player attacks using special munitions. That's right. So that's minus one. That's one such. Yeah. Tear gas, right? Minus one for authority. For every five Seattle police department units on the map, they lose one authority because it looks, you know, it's, it's the more police presence, the more kind of destabilizing the worst the authorities look. Right. And the opposite too, when, when protesters are taken off the map through various, you know, through whatever, people lose interest. And so their exposure goes down. But then there are random events. You have a random events table. You have two different. Yes. I like to do random events. And, and I will have my little jokes in the random events. Go ahead. What are your favorites? A lot of them like, you know, if you roll a 23 coffee break, oh no, actually, I even love this one. Roll a 24, folk music festival, remove all liberal units. They reappear in the morning turn of the following day because they all went to a folk music festival. So then you have to take all those out. Yeah. View roll a 26. Hey, Bevis. Yeah. Yahoo units arrive. I think it's six young units arrived. Is that right? As reinforcements, you pick them out. You know, rapid response. View roll a 33 or 34. All national guard or state trooper emergency reinforcements, the authority player has on the way, arrive one turn earlier. So I noticed that for, so you have dice, for example, for this game, you roll one for random events, you roll one for, it's like tens and reinforcement. Right. And then you, and then each side rolls because you have, you know, cops on one side and, or maybe I'm in a mix and then the protesters on another. But I noticed, for example, in your Ukraine game, you don't use dice. You use a deck of cards. And then it goes like suit and so on, rather than dice. And how, I mean, it looks a lot more complex to me, the Ukraine crisis game. Is it more complex than battle Seattle? Would you say? Yes, it is because what we were just talking about the exposure index. So all that, the information front, you know, or the perception of who is winning or who's controlling the narrative about who's, who's doing that. And in Ukrainian crisis, that's only one of the three fronts that you can fight on. There's sort of the information front. And there's the military front, of course, which is covert and over military intervention. And then there's the diplomatic front where the Ukrainian player is trying to assemble this coalition of international supporters and partners and Russia is trying to keep people neutral and out of the fray. And so, and the currency in that game is not exposure index points, but something that I call prestige, which is kind of like a basket of, you know, just things like moral and political capital, you know, again, perception of who's winning, you know, control the narrative, that kind of thing. Right. And the more prestige you have, the more you have to expend. When I, the first version of Ukrainian crisis, when I wrote up the rules, I made an illusion in explaining the concept of prestige to the Seinfeld episode, the one about the Piz dispenser, where George complains to Jerry that he has no hand in the relationship, but, you know, he has no, he has no hand. He cannot dominate. He's not the one with initiative. He's not the one calling the shots. And of course, if you have more prestige to expend in this game than the other side, then you're the one with hand. And boy, you're going to need it. So, yes, it is a more complicated game just because you have those three fronts, but, and you have this currency that you expend, you know, on those three different levels of struggle. So it's, it's an exercise in abstraction and reduction in synthesis. But this is what you try to do as a designer. You know, you can't have everything in your game, and you can't have multiple little processes for everything. So, you can try to work things out to the point where, you know, people can handle it, you know, without getting too bored or lost by it. By the way, speaking of prestige, there's a famous kind of frightening D. Natchison quote, D. Natchison being sort of like the Obi-Wan Kenobi of post-war American, you know, Empire, whatever you'd call it, Georgetown set, thinking. And he said prestige, if I remember right, prestige is the shadow cast by power. So if you have more prestige, you have more power. And if you don't have much prestige, that means you don't have much power backing it up. And it seems to be a, it seems to be a, Hey, and Mao should have had a poor pre-dual. Yeah. I think Mao would have won, but that's a good line now. Well, yeah, but I mean, that shows unsuspected potential. Yeah, it is good. No, that puts the concept across quite well, actually. I think it's not just the exercise of sheer naked power itself, but the implications of using it. Right. And then you have these cards here with you, Ukraine crisis game, which I guess if you turn over the wrong suit or wrong card, I'm not sure. Like for example, this must be involving prestige like ISIS crisis. Ukrainian player does not receive prestige or RP from US, Great Britain or France, this turn only. You know, Moldova must play role one day. So if you roll a one or a through three, the Moldova army moves against Russian peacekeepers in Transnistra. Three is Russian prestige, four through six, Moldova declares neutrality. And this is something you want. So on the side of the map here, you have all these other sort of number, is that is that per play it goes zero through 49 and there's a sort of continuum from neutral to support to intervention and I have to admit I didn't fully get the game. So how does that work? Again, what you've got there is the diplomatic front. And again, Ukraine is trying to build a coalition of more powerful countries that are able to support it with more prestige and more resources too. Because resources are what they need to build up their military power to defend against a Russian invasion if it comes to that. The other point because this game doesn't use dice is that you have instead a set of efforts. So you have like minimal efforts, moderate efforts and maximum efforts. And it's like you have all of these are available to you at the beginning of the game. And you get to choose what you want to push and how hard during the game. The game itself is limited to seven turns. So it plays pretty quickly. You know, you don't have very much time to to daily, daily around. But if you decide the time has come for a major diplomatic offensive in order to secure US or UK support, which is quite valuable in the game, then that's what you're going to expend more effort on. And you're going to expend a little bit less effort on, you know, say mobilizing your own forces or trying to, you know, score some kind of propaganda coup against the Russians. But it's up to you. So you decide when and where you want to apply the effort. But you only have so much to go around. You have to make some choices. And that's what makes games interesting really is two things. Main games interesting. One is the narrative or the story that the players build while they're going through the game. And the other is what they call the tyranny of small choices. Every turn you have at least one or two, you know, and sometimes a lot more little decisions to make. And that's what keeps you playing. That's what keeps you interested. Mm-hmm. I had a couple funny notes here. Also in these cards that you have, fuck the EU. That was a Vickie Nuland's famous line that she was caught saying, fuck the EU. Each EU country in the support. So this has to do with the diplomatics. And the support or intervention zones moves one zone towards neutral. Yeah. I will have my little jokes. Yeah. That was good. But and then, you know, I'm not even going to get into it here because I know we've been keeping you so long. But the third is where the Lebanon War game. I mean, it looks like it looks fascinating. It looks like that's real gaming, like real war game. I don't know which one is your favorite. Could you tell me like, I don't know, what would you say you're easiest in your most difficult game is? And then maybe like one or two of your favorites? Sure. Well, as I said before, Gorilla checkers is the one that I'm probably most proud of because it's so simple. And it says so much of what I think ought to be said about the essence of irregular warfare. I really wish that I had more simple ideas, but you know, it's very hard to have simple ideas. Yes, it's very, very hard to have simple ideas. Yeah, I can't wait to find a checker board though. Play this on the edge. Just the idea of six checker pieces and then 66 ghost stones. I love that idea. John, you can just get yourself a piece of paper and draw yourself a little eight by eight grid because the color of the squares doesn't matter. And get yourself a bag of M&Ms. They'll be your little pieces and then get yourself, I don't know, half a dozen scotch mince or jelly beans or something. And use those as the counterinsurgence. And you can eat your prisoners. All right. Yeah. I'm going to put up the page if you don't mind showing the rules for Gorilla checkers after we do this interview up on the Gary Brecher Facebook page because it's a brilliant, brilliant idea for again. Thank you. Yeah, now your favorites. That's my most favorite one. There are others that I'm proud of because they've proven really inspiring to me or influential. I mentioned that Algeria game, for example, that was the first game in any language on the Algerian war, which I thought was a really interesting and vital insurgency. So much going on in that particular conflict and so consequential. Now it was, I alluded how some people in the US government were using the basis of those game mechanics for their own work. And indirectly that led me to get in touch with Volko Runka, who at the time was an analyst and a teacher at the Sherman Kent School for the CIA. And he had been working on a game about the insurgency in Colombia. I didn't know this at the time, but the mechanics in my Algeria game had partly influenced him in coming out with the game mechanics for this particular game he had on the Colombian insurgency. And it came to be called the coin system. And it's turned out to be a very popular family or system, game system for all kinds of different conflicts. Not all of them are about insurgencies. The system itself is very, very flexible and it can go in all kinds of different directions. I'm working on one right now that uses this system for Canadian politics from the 1950s to the near future, for example. So it's not a kinetic or violent situation at all, but it uses the same mechanics. So that was very influential in that way. Is that CIA guys game? Is that publicly available? Oh, yes, yes. Okay. So it's a game system and it's a family of games. There's about a dozen in the system right now. And it's available from a company called GMT. I see, I see. Yeah, we'll put all these links up on our various social media manifestations. But I'd like to lobby for something that was really popular in the alberna valley. And that would be a war between BC and Alberta. The alberta has come over the passes, firing out of every window on the RVs. Well you do have an alternative history, US invasion of Canada game, right? I have it. So can you tell us a little bit about that one? Yeah, that's called War Plan Crimson. And it's based on an actual war plan that the US Department of War put together in the 1930s. So you guys have probably talked in the past about the rainbow war plans that the Americans came up with in the 1930s, where the different adversaries were identified by different colors. So War Plan Orange, for example, Japan was orange. And so the war plan that they worked out there was, okay, what do we do if, you know, Japan expands into the Pacific? How are we going to do this? And of course, that war plan that they put together in the 30s informed how they actually fought the war when it eventually started. But there were other war plans that they put together that weren't really likely, but they were there as good exercises, you know, thought experiments for staff officers to work on. So Crimson was one of those because Canada is Crimson. Germany is black. Mexico is green. You know, every potential adversary had some kind of a color. War plan white, of course, was their plan for dealing with massive civil disruption within the United States. But they retired that one after a while. Anyway, War plan Crimson was an actual plan they had, you know, thinking if we had to invade Canada, this is how we would do it. And so this game actually has two small maps that are separated by about 300 miles. So there's one small map, which is the approaches to Halifax in Nova Scotia. And the other one is the approaches to Montreal, you know, at the head of the St. Lawrence. And so the American player has a decision to make at the beginning of the game. How many forces they're going to divide, you know, you can switch back and forth a little bit. But how much effort are you going to put behind seizing Montreal? How much you're going to put behind seizing Halifax? And, you know, and of course, I had to take an awful lot of liberties, you know, with the actual balance of forces between the two sides. Because while the American army was very, very small in the 1930s, because this takes place about 1935 to 1939 somewhere in there. You know, while the American army was very small, Canada had scarcely any army at all. It was like a tenth, less than a tenth the size of the American army. So I had to put in a lot of volunteer units, you know, which are like Mounties and farmers with shotguns. Right. And if they can hang on long enough, then the British army, parts of the British army, start showing up. Yes. You know, hope that, you know, they decided to come to the 8th Canada. Vengeance for 1783, huh? Yeah, in 1812. In 1812, although they pretty much won that. But yeah, 1815 maybe. So yeah, but that's an example of, you know, just a hypothetical and of course, you know, it's just a, it's an interesting little experiment, but there's nothing serious about it. Some of the hypotheticals that I've come up with though are ones that are maybe a little bit more serious. And you mentioned 3rd Lebanon. Right. And that's one that I put together about 10 years ago, just before the Syrian civil war started. And so Syrian intervention in the original form of the game is quite likely. And now of course, it's something that you can remove from the game and just, you know, you can think about it and just say, okay, either the Syrian civil war never happened or Syria just removes itself as a player in this potential game, which is all about the idea of going into southern Lebanon to stamp out his below once and for all. Right. Which didn't work too well for them in the real version in 2000. Yes. And as a matter of fact, there is a 2006 scenario in the game so you can, you can see just how much changed between 2006 and, you know, this hypothetical, you know, contemporary rematch because the IDF made a lot of changes in the structure and equipment and training of the armed forces after 2000s because they did get such a punch in the nose. The problem with that, I would think, is that presumably Hasbalah made a lot of changes too, but Hasbalah has the most extraordinary media discipline. Yes. And the force in the world so you're not going to hear about it much. Yeah. So if this ever actually happens, it's going to be a big surprise. Right. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's amazing. That's really interesting. Right. So I think, I think we can wrap it up here. I mean, there's, yeah, I'm sure people are going to probably reach out to you and we could go on and on because it's so fascinating. But I think at this point, it's just time to get down to playing games. I'm going to rope my older boy, Sammy, who's seven and a budding-warnard into playing one or two of these games with me. Definitely battle for Seattle when he gets it. That'll have to wait a few years. Get started on Gorilla Checkers because it's very easy and he'll be able to talk what's going on and he'll get to beat his old man pretty, pretty handily. That's a great idea. I always bring copies of Gorilla Checkers to like gamer conventions and things because people pick it up so quickly. And when they bring their kids, I give them a copy of this and they sit down and they play and you know, that's a great idea. Quite often they get to beat bad. Yes. Yeah. I'd say if you're, if you're looking to interest him in something, try and find a game that's yeah, number one, not too complex, but it's also in a topic that he finds interesting. Right. So I don't know. He's probably not too interested in the Chinese culture revolution. He's just yet. So if you had a Mario game here, he'd be all over it. A Super Mario game. You know, but when he gets more into history, which will take a few more years, then we'll do some of the other ones. But I strongly recommend, I mean, again, we're going to post the link to the Lidography, which was a new word, I learned, which is the bibliography of all of his games. You know, I mean, he even have like chili 73 or in your small border wars. You have like the, what's it called, the Tession Crisis? Is that the Poland, Poland, Czechoslovakia crisis? Yes, that's right. One week long. Right. And you mentioned Cypress. Yes. So I did the 1950s emergency, but I also did one on the 1974 invasion. Right. Yeah, we just finished talking about that, which was, I mean, I don't know how you do it differently. You also have one Konarmia about the Russo-Polish War of 1920, which is a fascinating war. So it must be a great game, I bet. I feel like you've done a few versions of it. Yeah, it, well, I reworked that one a few years later. And it came out as Red Horde 1920. Right. So Konarmia is pretty long out of print, but you could still get copies of Red Horde 1920. Okay. And BTR games, there's, you can get about eight of my games on for print and play for not very much money. Right. And I can, I can send you a link for that. Okay. Because there you can find things like Red Guard, you know, which is my game on the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Oh, great. It's very chaotic. That's fascinating. The Cultural Revolution. Like who would have imagined that? You can make that into a game. I wouldn't fall that one. Yeah. See, this is the thing. There's a lot of chaos in the design, which is too much for some people. Right. That's exactly the mindset that I want to instill in the players. Right. Yeah. Right. That's great. It needs more than a couple of people to play to become interesting. And it is quite chaotic. So you have to be kind of, you have to have that, you know, frame of mind. Right. Some people who play these games are real control freaks. You know, they don't even like the idea of a random event's table. Right. And that's where I have all my little jokes. So. All right. Great. Well, on that cheerful note, I really appreciate you talking to us, Brian. I'm glad you're with us. This was great. And yeah, really, really strongly recommend people check out the games. You can start off by downloading one or more of the free games and move on to some of the paid board games. And they're all great. So anyway, thank you so much. Brian Trang is brilliant. Thank you so much. It was great. All right. Bye.",
