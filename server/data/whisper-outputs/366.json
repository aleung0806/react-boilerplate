    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. The date today is February 11, 2023 and this is episode 366. I'm the Ghost Mark Ames. I am in Rochester, New York. You're listening to Radio Warner at patreon.com-radio-warnard. I'm on the line with John Dolan, aka Gary Betcher, aka the Warner in Glasgow. John, you feel a little better? Yeah, I feel a little better. People can probably hear my voice sounds more like whatever normal is than before. You sound much better. Yeah. All right, so we don't need to yap too much because we have an amazing guest and interview with the legendary journalist Seymour Hirsch, who just put out an absolute bombshell of a story. How America took out the Nord Stream pipeline. The New York Times called it a mystery, but the United States executed a covert sea operation. That was kept secret until now. Seymour Hirsch, of course, is probably the most legendary investigative journalist alive. He is famous for a Pulitzer Prize winner. He uncovered the Meal Eye Massacre, and I wanted many, as he would say, but he got the goods on the Meal Eye Massacre, which really had a huge impact after they failed to bury it. That was in around, I think, 69 or 70. His biggest scoop in 1974, 75, I've written and talked about this a lot, was exposing the CIA's illegal domestic spying program on anti-war dissidents, MHKOS. The CIA was eventually caught spying on at least 300,000 Americans against its charter, which is what led to the famous church committee hearings. That was Hirsch. He did not get a Pulitzer for that, by the way, and it's rumored that Ben Bradley, who was Washington's competition, is one of the reasons why. I think he had some poll on the jury. Wow. It's interesting, as we were saying before the show, that as far as I can tell, the Washington Post has not had one word about Hirsch's latest scoop, which you'll be talking about. Yep. Nothing to watch post, nothing in the New York Times. Something in Reuters about the denial, calling it a blog post, because he published it on Substack. That does not mean he doesn't have editors, as we'll hear. I mean, the reason why it's such a well-crafted professional piece is because Hirsch used excellent editing and copy editing. Anyway, other stories he's done in books. I mean, I'll read a few of his books, The Price of Power, Kissinger and the Nixon White House. I think he had a legendary relationship with Kissinger. The target is destroyed. What really happened to Flight 007 and what America knew about it. We talked about that on an earlier, really, a warning episode, because he's still consistently. Yeah. The dark side of Camelot, which upset a lot of JFK fans. And more recently, the killing of Osama Bin Laden, which is part of the reason, I think, why the liberal, the center, center left. One of the big reasons why they really turned on him, because he was critical. It was not part of the Washington. He spoiled Obama's big holiday, basically. Yep. And reporter, a memoir, which is where he mentions some articles I wrote about him. And it's because of that. And he cited me in that book, which was a huge honor. And that was sort of my opening to get this interview with Simor. He said it's the first interview he's giving about this. So excited. It ain't easy. That's all I can tell you. Interviewing him ain't easy. It's for me. It's unlike any interview I've ever done before. It's pretty scary. It's he is the real thing. He's not like, doesn't have a, I don't know, some kind of fake persona. And then you talk to him. He's like, no, he is a lot scarier to talk to than I imagine. But great. Wild, wild interview. So without further ado, I think we should get to our interview about a story, but he broke just briefly a quick background on the story, because we're not going to talk about with him. What he exposed was that the Nord Stream pipelines, which were mysteriously blown up on September 26th last year, that it was an American operation approved by the National Security Council in the CIA Chief Bill Burns on Biden's directions, that the plan was first ordered to be cooked up as far back as early mid-2021, just not too long after Biden took office. We've talked about the incoming Biden administration decided to take a lot more robustly hawker stance towards Russia in Ukraine. And they were already planning to blow this up, which is pretty amazing, because publicly the Blinken State Department had said, we're not going to any longer lean on Germany about Nord Stream 2. You can build it if you want. And then privately they started working on plans to blow these things up. And then the plan went really into motion. In February of 2022, as the war was, you know, it was clear that Russia was going to invade. And they trained up some Navy, US Navy divers to plant explosives, cover them up. And then they used their Norwegian friends who had an interest in this, because Norway produces enormous amounts of gas and has long-old relationships with the US, including Yen Stoltenberg, who, young Yen Stoltenberg, I looked this up, I saw one of the lines of trying to attack this harsh piece, was he says Stoltenberg has been a CIA asset since the Vietnam War, but that can't be because he was a teenager. Like, you know, thinking that Hirschman, he was some kind of super spy in Saigon when he was 16. But you go back to the record when Stoltenberg was named the head of NATO, they all talk about how he was a famous anti-war protestor who threw rocks at the US embassy. And somehow all of young Yen's friends got pinched, except for Yen's. Wow. That's amazing. Moved on up to be the NATO chief, yeah. And he came from his dad was the defense minister. Anyway, I don't want to talk anymore about this. I just want to give a little bit of background for those people who don't yet know the whole story here. It's an insane story. You know, talk about this with him. And so let's get right to our interview with Seymour Hirsch. Hello. Hi. Good. That sounds good. Why would we do that? Fucking guy from Germany called and said, oh, we are now. We didn't make a day. I said, because I'm Lazy. Let's just start. Let's just do this goddamn thing. Okay. Let's go. I see. I saw that the Germans are starting to try to cope with this story and. Hope. You know what they're doing? Copying. Trying to. Yeah. All right. So that's John is my partner there. Hi. I'm Mr. Hirsch, John Dull and here on the news. And I tell you, buddy, I owe you, buddy, because of the nice things he wrote. I think it was my first interview. I don't know. I don't know. Let's go. Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Rolling. Okay. Good. And three to one. Okay. We are really excited and honored to have here with us the legendary reporter Seymour Hirsch. Hold on one second. I got a clap for the director. Hold on. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. It's my show. So I got to do it. It's not over. That's fine. That's fine. All right. So again. Yep. And three to one. Okay. We are really honored and excited to have with us the legendary Pulitzer prize winning. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The creative journalist Seymour Hirsch. Got to do it. Uncovered everything from the Meal Eye Massacre, the illegal CIA domestic spying programs, MHK us through the Abu Ghraib Torture scandal. And on and on and on. And without going too much into background here, we'll say more when we're off the phone with you when we talk about introducing it. You've just put out a new bombshell story that the world as I'm seeing it going back through your memoir. You're the author of several books, by the way, the last which was reporter a memoir in which I got a nice shout out. And that was my intro to you. But anyway, going back through your memoir. You know, and we'll get into this. You see this a lot with your stories every time you put out something that people don't want to hear they ignore it. They bury it. They ridicule it. They do all this shit. But anyway, the first thing I want to talk about is this. This is an insane story. This is a story that you got that Biden approved an operation. That the mystery of the Nord Stream pipeline bombings is solved and that Biden approved an operation where US Navy divers working with Norway set off those explosives. And what that means is that the US committed an act of war or terrorism against its own ally. In the middle of a war, I'm going to quote here real quickly. This is about the ambassadors to NATO met right after the pipeline explosions. And here's a quote from them that I got from V.O.A. News from back in September 29th. Any deliberate attack against allies critical infrastructure would be met with a united and determined response, which I guess now the United and I did determine response to silence. But you have this quote in your story, C.More, that I think is for me stood out as kind of one of the key quotes. And it is this throughout quote all of this scheming your source said quote some working guys in the CIA in the State Department were saying don't do this. It's stupid and will be a political nightmare if it comes out. Isn't it incredibly stupid or if I lost my mind here like why would in your years of reporting have you come across something like this? You mean something you mean you're asking somebody who was involved in writing about the Vietnam war and massacres come across something like this. Well blowing up your allies your allies critical infrastructure. But they didn't see it that way they saw the oil they saw the gas coming from Russia into you have to understand Russia's full of methane gas in Siberia they they they could go for decades. But Russia had pipelines that were supplying gas to Germany. At a discount price very cheap all the gas they could use so much so that the German companies were taking some of the gas and reselling for profit. And the Russians you know whether it was a company controlled by gas from which is controlled by olikarks which are obviously a respectful of Putin's put their mildly. But 49% of it were four different European countries that were who were who ran companies that were selling gas downstream all over Europe. So you have a tremendous source of the gas cheap gas for Europe and the Germany's a real powerhouse you know Mercedes and they have the largest chemical BASF the largest chemical company in the world they soak up and they're industrial based. And and so the fear was Biden wants this war I mean don't ask the white president want war I think it's good for their ratings I just don't know. But Biden was very big on you know showing the showing the Russians that in the Ukraine with Russian with Ukrainian body soldiers that we can we'll show them we can send up the Russian it's good politically in America too. We all you know we wake up every day and you know with kicking Russia and Putin or you know anyway I can't tell you all I can tell you is is that he saw that gas as a weapon because as long as Russia was selling that weapon. Russia was selling that much gas they thought Russia could would weaponize it if we thought it would if there was a war this is all beginning this all these this if from this point of view began before the war started last February year ago almost from today and the Russians that made it clear what they were they were building up on on the coast of Belarus what you will it was very clear they were going to go right actually by the time. Biden made the threat Biden in February the seventh and by the time the Russians are already beginning to move up a hospital. You know with emergency operating rooms and all that so it's great they were going so he gets on he has the German ambassador shoulder with him he has a news conference in February in the White House and he's they're all talking about. We're going to stop this gas not going to get you know Russia we will not let Russia if Russia attacks we will not let them we're not let Russian gas keep on coming and we will do this and these asked what do you mean while we know how to do it we will get it on right should said nothing right and a couple weeks earlier the under secretary for state Newland. Yeah had said of the news conference we can stop it we just want to Russian and we can stop their gas by any means. Yes if Russian beach Ukraine one way or another Nord Stream 2. On the right so what does that mean yeah so I don't know what if anybody's thinking but I'll take with that means you know that's called a threat yeah so you're asking me how did you find this story yes you know I know a friend of mine put it this way what you've done so I know friend of mine smart friend you're an expert at deconstructing the obvious yeah what else was it but you also got but you also got sources I mean you have a great source walking you through the you know if I think with the newspapers particularly the German these they were very nasty to me and the New York times and the Washington University of Normandy I think what they want to really what they think I should do is you know use his name and get a good jail right stuff like that which would end my career you know I haven't put anybody in I've been doing this for 50 years me like started 69 and I would take something inside the community I protect people I'm taking heat I have a source I'm taking heat but that's okay that's my job right but it's their job to understand the business a little better and they know the business a little better at the New York Times of Washington Post they know it they know it they know the New York Times the problem is that the New York it's all been cheapen because now the New York Times of Washington Post they think you know an unnamed source can be a press guy press secretary somebody who with something on the side to them I don't know they don't seem to have anybody inside right that the coverage of the Ukrainian war is is compared to what I'm hearing from my friends who have access to the information it's not just in country you know don't you know sources don't all have to be from America you know there are other countries that we're very close to I'm saying that I'm just telling you the thinking so dumb right I will tell you that I've been hearing from you know the war I know about isn't the war you're reading about could you elaborate on that a little bit no I just imagine you know we're not going as well no but no of course not yeah yeah the Russians have a put you know the Russian thing too so great are they I think I think they make great misjudgments yes but you know they have a 350,000 man regular army that hasn't gone in yet yeah they're still working with outsiders yeah so that is the point the point I'm getting off of track the point is that the point is that these guys know better than you know they're just doing it because I don't know maybe they think that the story I wrote supports Russia does suggest that they have probably there's is I don't know a lot of looking at the law about it and the law in the sea is very interesting there are treaties they go back to 1884 when we began the late telegraph lines across the ocean and you if you if you inadvertently or deliberately ran across the line that was a real bad deal you but there were I there were most the economic consequences there's actually no law on the books that says knocking off a pipeline and the pipelines in question the Nord Stream one and Nord Stream two two major pipelines they both recovered they can't they ran over 700 most roughly 750 miles from from basically from St. Petersburg in in down all the way into northeast Washington Germany one way straight shot all the way down the Baltic Sea that's a lot of pipeline is about 12,000 people 12,000 pipelines now and there's no law on the books that says deliberately building up a pipeline is a crime because that is not considered but it's certainly a lot of law about key damages if you damage a pipeline you know and this is a pipeline is probably going to cost I didn't get into it but they had a they they have this a Swiss company it did an estimate 1.5 billion to fix the pipelines right so they maybe too much I don't know what's going to do with it I mean don't you think look Germany's as you were talking about earlier Germany is this industrial powerhouse and it's export economy we just interviewed a couple days ago anyway you know a person who runs a business magazine out of Germany it's export economy has been predicated on cheap piped in not spot Ellen not Ellen G spot market sort of you know going up and down with the market but but piped contracted you know for a few decades the exact price you know how cheap it is how below market it is and you can build your whole industry on that and since they lost that since the war started BASF as you mentioned the petrochemicals giant has shuttered something like a hundred factories so with the US is doing is is crippling the economy and you know one thing in your story you talk about I mean it's really Bill Burns and Jake Sullivan Bill Burns ahead of the CIA and Jake Sullivan I had a national security council who pushed this forward but I assume you know at the behest of Biden or they got into his head or screws I don't know but I got to say I'm surprised Bill Burns who is a diplomat who I don't know if you read his cablesexhales they were came out a week leaks I mean they're very well written cables. He's got a lot of journalist's we respect him I like reading his cables one of his cables. He's an ambassador out in it was either Ukraine or Russia in 2007 said if we try to bring Ukraine you know it's clear now having talked these people we try to bring Ukraine into NATO Russia will go to war it's a red line and now he's approving blowing up our allies you know what feeds the allies export economy what do you think happened to Bill Burns for example. I don't know how I know I can give you I just a question I know he wants to be a secretary of state maybe in a future government but I don't know him that well but he's always been a gentleman every time I talk to him he's always been polite and failing not very helpful not interested but you know I just don't know I mean the question is I mean you're actually right about everything but BASF has actually been talking to China about movies some facilities there. I mean this is devastating in another way you can say it's good because China's hugely advanced in us and renewables and so I think the Germans and Macron of France went there and don't forget Schultz went there I have to get more interest at renewables because you're not going to be able to depend on the natural gas anymore but it's dummy the economic stuff which isn't been reported nearly enough in the Western press here. Yes this is called I guess you're you know shooting off your left foot you know for no reason what's our yes we shot ourselves in the foot yes it's stupid beyond belief yes it's a criminal I I would think that it's it's certainly unquestionably a wonderful degree of stupidity at the White House and that part of the president it's just stupid it's just damn it. I'm stupid because he was they didn't want they say so Russia is weaponizing the war yeah weaponizing the question is next question is you have to ask yourself what is which presidents why did they like war yeah because politically useful yeah so but you know I can't tell you I don't have you know I don't know everything you said is totally correct it's yeah it's been a lot of time looking at the economic consequences just like you you know they're from being in Russia so long yeah you're I mean it's down stream it's it's it's it's classively bad yeah and it's it's it's it's excusable and then but but the way I look at it you know they they the White House this White House you know despite all the criticism of Biden they they have the New York times and the Washington Post MSN and CNN and and uh frontings of them yep yeah the enemy is Fox News the only reporter called me from any TV station of outside of you know somebody that's running a kitchen of another house it was uh let's his name Tucker Carlson all that right yeah I'm Tucker just have a was out of talk show when he wore a bow tie but I remember very smart yeah but he knows he called me if he said I know I know you don't like what I do but I'm on this one yeah I said yeah I wouldn't go on the show because I you know I know but I he's been dead right yeah something else Tucker's been right about it is the war yeah you're crane but you know but but it's amazing to me that how how they fall in my colleagues they into it and I was in New York times yes that's I know no I mean yeah yeah Mr. Hershey I'm old enough to remember when me live broke and there was a sense of no I need the money so uh don't we all yeah so I remember there was a sense of the media as as being against a few die hard maniacs in the national security state and the media was on on the side of the truth and they were wanted it uncovered and that seemed to change at some point I mean the me lie story I went back and read how it was received people now say oh well you know see where Hershey's lost it uh this story it's not like the me lie story you know people have this idea in their in their minds that the that the press was so much more open and and and and so merit a credit and so on but you had a hard time a really hard time getting your me lie massacre stories published you had to you couldn't get it in life magazine look magazine these were huge magazines at that time uh and and you're you're already a well-known AP reporter in Washington so you had to go with like what's a version of Substack almost which was a friend of yours and brand new um uh new service wire service dispatch new service just to get it out there right well it was even worse than that because life I had actually been I had been out of the uh I left the I covered the Pentagon for the AP for a couple years that's how I learned the hate to war but after that since then I'd done I'd actually done a book and was giving speeches and had done a bunch of stuff in the New York Times magazine so I wasn't out of the loop and um I in when I learned the me lie story I was a freelancer but I was doing stuff and um doing a second book and so um uh yes the me lie story nobody wanted it and life had asked the life I went to life right away because they'd offered me uh they wanted me to write for them at at that time I'm unheard of money you know more than you know ten cents a minute a word you know right so they already had offered me a job you know basically not just they wanted me to start writing for them and then it was a hot magazine remember it came out oh yeah it was huge yeah huge huge huge yeah and when he said no after a couple days I was then I knew there was a problem so it was not only that after I did this story uh people at Clark it was just automatically taking out the third story before we we got we broke through I found a kid who actually did the murders and talked about right and we took it I was working on a guy named David Ops who's later became we mentioned in earth he was a producer of he won a producer of that anyway and we went to AB we went to Walter Conkite and that did it uh Mike Wallace interviewed the kid but yeah so it was and really very hard to get it on so with this it's never been a question of a press being open the stories that might be very bad for us right exactly all the Hagiography did about World War 2 nobody wants to talk about the fact we spend two years doing daytime bombing of cities in Germany which is normal if we lost the war would have been described as you know the Germans were to try to hang every pilot of flu for war crimes say what you think we weren't you know the CPA then the circle of error was not even five miles you got within 10 miles of the targets you were lucky with your bombs then World War 2 so anyway it was all very primitive stuff so you're right it's you know I'm used to it this sort of stunned me because it was such an obvious story right the Russians into it if the Russians didn't do it you know would you country in NATO you know I was joking with a friend Masadoni are they in NATO made it you know I mean it's not even a hard story to understand the president of the United States and the Undersecretary of State both said they were going to do it and they did it they waited a long time but they did it they cut off oil and and they saw oil and then right after that I also this article that I did it for a sub-stack Anthony Blinken the Secretary of State in the fall actually literally within a few within a month within a month of the actual event which he of course knew about we did he gave a speech he which he talked about stopping Russia from weaponizing oil and gas right now is the time we can do it and he knew we already knew what we've already done he clearly was among the people who knew what happened and so it's it's just something you know we're we're really not a dumb country we're really a very smart country so a lot of very bright people this country we really can understand nuance but I'm not sure that you know I look the New York Times has a lot of terrific reporters on it there always has bright people they have sections that are terrific but when it comes to this kind of reporting that I don't know I'm not sure they underestimate the American people we're ready to accept the fact that a president did this and they it's not only accepting it but it's also saying at a time when of course everybody's terrified with you know what republicans gonna emerge you know are we gonna give now the Trump like character a lot of worry about that I understand that but you have to hold the president to account for something as you said you just explained why it was incredibly stupid to do it and I'll tell you they got through it all fall because it was a mile fall no one saw those stories it's cold now and I don't know that much about the rest of Germany but I talked to people in Berlin they're mad one of my best friends just came back from a subatical era in the academic and he got back he got back and he was saying you cannot believe how angry everybody is how cold they are how the gas prices are going up so high a big part of the budget we know that's going on in the UK yeah which has also lots of other problems the UK is you know what can you say about a country that voters that commits suicide with breaststroke you can't have too much you can't have much sympathy anyway we've been acting too long any other questions what do you we got to we we call yeah I did want to ask a big ball around yeah I want to I mean it's more of a sort of journalism society kind of question right but so when you did your I think your biggest story me live course was was huge but your most consequential story which was when you uncovered the C.A. is a legal domestic spying program in MHK us that that was first ran in the New York Times you finally got in the New York Times even after you got your Pulitzer for me lie they didn't hire you it took it took more time than that which is kind of incredible anyway you got that in the New York Times in late 74 this is like this brief period we've talked about this on the show which is almost like American Glossnos in the sort of mid 70s and there was pushback even then which is incredible they went after you for using anonymous sources they said you over wrote you know again the same usual I said it was massive that was the word they use on by the way in that story there were seven massive right seven unnamed stories that story I did not tell the New York Times editors about till Friday morning and my editor A. Rosenthal then conservators he was probably the best ever by far the best editor I've ever worked with I used to walk in the New York I'm in Washington he used to walk in the newsroom in the case you twice he went up behind me and did the Bill Murray Welp on your head and no these gave you no these with A.W. yeah no key it's very conservative and he'd say I was right little call me today yeah and he'd say next ends would be what do you have for me he knew he was he understood his personal instincts had nothing to do what you're knitting this it was after Watergate and the president was devalued we don't have that situation how we know I have from yourself to so then you could do things seven unnamed sources and I did did that story I did tell the office about till Friday morning I wrote all night and they ran 7,000 words in the Sunday paper which closed about six o'clock or seven o'clock the next morning and then without lawyers and all that stuff there was your trust there yes yes you know and but there you know the public has lost that much trust and yeah I can understand I can understand it's you know if it's said of trying to track down some of the stuff and saying well yeah I unnamed sources but it is true that that that the president did say this and and the other secretary did say this and the secretary of state did say this you know we got to stop it this is a weapon you know it's clear there was a rationale beyond just words for this thing and they don't do that right well and it gave him so it's only been a week I mean I was always Wednesday you're the first guy to talk to about it and here we have beating it around all right no 20 minute interview I've done I'm sorry I'm gonna keep keep you here a little bit but you know look the thing about the MHK House program is that despite the push the usual pushback it was less so because this is right after Watergate and there was and there there there was a response I mean the government was worried at that time that the journalist sort of investigative journalism had a lot of cash and even Rosenthal Rosenthal was may have been an establishment guy but he was also a capitalist and a you know the competitor I mean I have a quote here of what he said about you he said um he said Hersh is like a puppy that isn't quite housebroken but as long as he's pissing on Ben Bradley's carpet let him go so a quote that I found from him about you he wanted you to ask the Washington Post right no but you know people talk yeah there was a pretty profound relationship with he's not reckless a Rosenthal yeah he once called he wanted to know who I was talking to for one story and the people I told them stunned them okay um stunned them you know they they were just people you wouldn't think that high up would be talking to me right so they knew it was really that yeah I would know anything editors I depend on their all you know editors are editors yeah it would be I would never be I would I think I'd rather commit suicide to be an editor because you're sent to the pen of so many of but he had he had a good instinct yeah and I came up in New Yorker the New Yorker the New Yorker they knew exactly who I talked to right and so you know they would always surprise them you know no he wouldn't be talking to you that guy that guy why would he be saying this to you and I once made the editor call up somebody very prominent said yeah I it's an off-the-record interview I did tell them that something about the Middle East anyway I'm just saying but but yeah they don't know and so but you know you're asking me you were a report you were in rest for years no I know I know but I want to hear it from you because you've been in it longer and you broke bigger stories than I did and but but but but but but you but because you know I'm telling you more than I told most people you know I appreciate it no it's not that it's just I do yeah so I do and so and some of them maybe don't know me or don't know it's a new generation and so and it's so much easier look when I worked at the New York Times the single worst thing they ever could ask me to do would be to chase somebody else's story somebody has a great story yeah what I don't chase other people's stories I'm telling that would be my reaction right and that explains part of the reason why people might not be following up on your story I mean there's a lot of jealous there was one time when I did some story and the the reporter who they asked the chase it called me up it was a it was a very prominent reporter it was a woman reporter and I said to her all you don't want it you know you don't want to chase stories I think she says I know I don't just don't chase it you don't have to chase it I won't hold you killed if you don't chase it she said oh thank you I'll tell him that you said you won't cooperate with me at all I said that's great I just I just deceived you do what I thought you would do so there you are yeah you know there's the doesn't have to be a she or he they didn't say what to have with any he would have happened right if you were majorly big player story you know some guy that access to the secretary of state all I you don't want to ask him these questions because you don't want all those access yeah I mean it's as simple as that you're on a beat I'm not on a beat I can come in and kick ass and nobody gets hurt I mean so they don't talk to me so I don't get invited to a dinner party which I don't want to go to anyway yeah exactly but but if you're recovering the times in 73 gave me the great plum because I've done so much good work for them on Watergate they offered me a chance to be the White House correspondent 70 late 73 early 74 when Ron Zeigler was so secretary I just don't want to do that they said whether if you're going to be a you know if you're going to be the next editor or have a column you got to do it side I said I don't want to do it he said you got to go it's up that's the big it then in 1973 74 being the White House correspondent for the New York Times you're in the paper every day it's all that stuff I went one day and saw the report is screaming yellow run Zeigler who's the secretary and I went back and I told Rosa's all that night I said here's what's going to happen if I have to do this one more day I'm quitting he said no you're not I said I'm quitting and he said call me call me back he said do what you want now if you get somebody else okay great I'm going back and just find stories for you that's true story right I didn't write it I don't know why too self-serving goodbye no that's a great story let me ask you though back then back then you know your your MHK 6.0 on the CIA's illegal domestic spying program which was massive because we found out ultimately it's spied they spied on 300,000 plus Americans that led to the Rockefeller Commission the famous church committee yeah and you know and ultimately a lot of the reforms pooped out but whatever it was they set up a House of Senate Committee and tell you yeah that really worked until the cell apart because of the the Pickering are you okay man yeah I got to working with oh he's also doing a duck and part of the doc is this crazy person that's involved in the doc but it's not about me it's about a story but they have to use this stuff anyway you know that goes yeah yeah I've done some docs I know how this goes yeah anyway so I'm down to gossip now with you what I know no I want to get back to it you instead you know you now are publishing on sub-stacken what you talked about earlier is absolutely true I mean there there seems to be this massive disconnect between the world that the Washington Post, New York Times and this kind of like elite level of establishment journalists I mean a much bigger disconnect than before I think and I don't know what you think where they they they have one view of the world which is very much in line with sort of a robust American foreign policy imperial foreign policy I already want to call it and then there's the rest of the country which it doesn't see things that way I mean for example like when when Biden pulled out of Afghanistan you remember he almost got torn apart by the Washington press doing something nobody else had to got to do exactly exactly I got a guy named Barack Obama right which he should have done look yeah I'll tell you this yeah go ahead what's your question my question is like is it a lot worse in that way than which I mean you're now publishing on sub-stack in some ways it's great because you get to go directly you know to a huge audience and you're not hemmed in by you know by establishment editors but on the other hand it gives the establishment a first thing you do the first thing Samarang does is hire a great editor okay but there's work for the me you kidding I'm not going to walk away from that I mean the first thing I've done is get the desert and I wish you would do more but I get well fantastic editor work on you know term I term my butter part on a story I say should no you don't walk away from that right the fact that I'm talking directly to people it doesn't mean I'm I'm I'm free to shoot my mouth off I have to be more careful good I'm glad to I have to make my own system in fact checking as to be as good as that the New Yorker which I don't think as good as it used to be when I was there when I was at the New Yorker the last round would be with the Grammarian you know about you know about parallelism since sentence sector right I don't know if they still do that she was anyway the bottom what are you looking for if then anyway the bottom line is the bottom line is no the thing about it is the yeah the responses unbelievable they had a more huge numbers of people wanting to read the story and they all write me they can't that somewhere in the corner my name is right which are about two thousand oh sixteen hundred emails in the last two and a half days right what do they say is oh my god we've been missing this kind of stuff yeah absolutely so it's yeah anyway um so there we are anyway look I I know you want to fill in our but I can't do no no no don't want to fill in our just last question you can answer this or not answer this um but yeah uh so I was reading another part of your of your excellent memoir reporter and um this was sort of a big moment for you and going into national security reporting where you were at a dinner and you basically got with some high level C i and xe i people and you you basically cut some amazing the the beginnings of some amazing scoops here uh the scoop on um you know basically the Soviet submarine scoop on mh chaos and um you know you weren't sure exactly like what to do with it in here i'm just going to read a quote from you here um you know an inevitable fear for any reporter who's critical of his government's policies is being fed a false story that would be professionally catastrophic so I resolved early that I would never publish information from someone on the inside without verifying it elsewhere even if a second source insisted I had to pretend he did not exist and in other words as you write here it's possible that there are you will publish an article where there are sources you have but you don't acknowledge them because that's your deal with sources um so I bring that up only because of of this story is there anything you can say about that? I don't know you see there you go yesterday about sources yeah and I don't want to talk about it I just don't want to talk about it but let me just say something to you right this isn't a hard story to find yes I'll tell you why there's a something called the pipeline industry there's an industry that makes people make American companies involved they build pipelines around the world are you listening to me? Yes yes yes they know what happened right I hear you okay I mean they know the last thing they want to do is end up in a goddamn newspaper story yes yes yes yes but they know who did what right of course they know they built the goddamn things you know I'm not talking necessarily the building one Nord Stream one or two right but they build pipeline they build pipelines and they talk to divers and they know what's happened they know has a capability and they know what they hear inside I mean come on the reason I ask that I'm not telling that to you because it's a reality there's nobody thinks about but I did of course the reason I bring it up is because I'm you know a lot of the same people that are attacking you smearing you the belling cats and the osent bros these are people that I've dealt with in my career and have gone after my stories and I hate them and and I've just seen these lines of attack and so I wanted to just you know bring that up and see or maybe you don't give a shit about these different ways of the trying to smear stories and noise me I can't care about building cat come yeah yeah I mean why don't you think about it next to a certain intelligent sage disease in a certain country come on you know you get to know who's who you know and so you know they I can't worry about that but there are legitimate people that complain a lot of private people that complain yeah but basically no you know but you know see the problem is you and one of the problems of talking about this the reason I have to do it because I don't want to think I'm hiding right because that you I get two questions that like you ask you know you always say you're trying to get a secondary source you know so you I just don't I hear sources nobody hit nobody knows who they are yep I hear you and you put you know yes yes yes but the one thing the government's good at is tracking down people who talk yep and now it's interesting because in the republican days they could get but then now they can't get warned this this just for the parliament is better you know they're not going to get they're not going to give out warrants like they used to right you know I will tell you there was a time and Bush Cheney where they could they could get warrants to get in the NSA transcripts of of phone conversations that were completely illegal that's insane yeah to make to make cases sometimes right you going my wife's going to lunch so you know I can tell you there was stuff going on and that what they did with the NSA you know the NSA can get anybody's self they they they collect you know Gmail and shit like that yeah you get a warrant for it but if you want to if you if you have a tough case to make in the New York district and you want to make an aggressive conservative attorney general right you can you can get somebody overheard and go to him and pretend as a fact that you you you have a source on the conversation he had and get a review witness right that kind of reduces for going on back in those days and then pushing push Cheney days I didn't get a run to that it was too busy chasing the more you get new every story but thank you so much see whether this has been a great conversation really appreciate yes I appreciate it yes yes yes thank you so much take care whoo okay uh that was our interview with the legendary journalist Pulitzer Prize winner Seymour Hirsch about his bombshell story that everybody is either trying to ignore and looking really stupid trying to ignore it that's like you know talking about major establishment media or and or trying to smear pick apart and so on and so forth about basically pointing the finger as he said is obvious that the US was responsible for I mean he details the whole operation for blowing up the Nord Stream pipelines and um damn you know again I you know I said this before I thought it was so crazy when it first happened last year before like investigators are coming out and saying Russia didn't do it or we don't know who did it it seems so crazy that the US would do this because of the downside I mean the upsides I get there was a lot more upside for the US than Russia but there were a lot bigger I still think downside for the US than for Russia doing it Russia would just say okay you blew up your own pipeline whereas the US blew up what NATO itself had already said was critical allied infrastructure and we did it and it said I think when you look at the mainstream press now you're they have decided on their own that we are at war and by we yeah that means the acela corridor the expensive sub-erbs of these coast and uh that means the rules have changed like to me the most shocking article I've seen about this was by somebody named Mia Jankowitz and as far as I can tell she's uh she wrote about aesthetics and whatever that means in journalists terms until she was hired by insider to write an article about Hershey's article and it's called the claim by a discredited journalist that's Hersh that the US secretly blew up the Nord Stream pipeline is proving a gift to Putin and this is what passes for reasoning in the centrist world that it helps the Russians therefore shut up um that's it yeah and writers of course only reported the government's denial that it happened and and called it a blog post and obvious looking down their nose at it I mean this again this is the sort of things that Hershey's been dealing with if anybody has a more convincing story than this come out with it show us the goods you know yeah there is nothing like this and and anyway we'll have to see what the consequences are it's it's it's Hersh so you can pretend like oh it's a sub-stack or he's seen out whatever the fuck but um it doesn't matter it's out there coursing through the veins and the elite layer a cell accord or in their and their counterparts in natal and can try and pretend they're not seeing it but it's it's out there you can see why why Hersh would become sort of cantankerous after a while I mean I'm reading this this smear by Mia Jankuit and here's a quote the open source investigative outlet bell and cat was deeply critical of Hershey's reporting on chemical attacks in Syria and vox raised doubts about his infamous claim that about Osama okay so we've got bell and cat and vox I read the vox one recently because people cite it and all he kept saying is this doesn't make sense this does it it's not that here's a fact that is the opposite of what he wrote it's just this doesn't make sense well a lot of things don't make sense it doesn't make sense that the US would blow up Germany's energy pipeline okay so um yeah and belling cat what can you say it's like I I loved his answer to that like their spies yeah spy is a spy I don't have an answer to spies and let's you know let it be not there nobody has better sources in the intelligence community than see more her so when he says belling cat or just a bunch of spooks and like second rate ones at that I mean that's obviously what they're saying in the in that community so that was that was nice dear I mean we know they're funded by the NED the National Endowment for Democracy and that they're pretty creatinists especially Elliot Higgins anyway there was an email that was leaked from the British government saying you know belling cat isn't effective anymore because everybody knows they're with us and besides everybody knows they'll say anything for money yeah uh you know it hasn't stopped so many people in the in the media anyway it's the usual story I just want to talk right now though about damn I just talked to see more hers uh I mean I I I I I'm scared it's tough yeah I took a break after we talked to wind upstairs and before coming back down to talk to do a little post game thing but I feel like like if I were doing a post game interview in this video I'd have two black eyes right now with the video camera like I was at pants to explain to you I didn't sneak out yeah John's connection dropped and I was uh uh they're facing you one-on-one well the thing is so I did a brief kind of pre-interview with her she wanted to hear me and you know check me a did proper journalistic thing and we talked to him yesterday and he was but he was sick so he was he has a reputation for being extremely difficult I mean um I've looked up some you know that people have used harder words than that but I I found him you know rather more or less like actually really fun to talk to you yesterday and today although it was fun I don't think I've ever in my life and maybe it didn't sound this way from the outside but it sure felt this way inside the confines of my big giant head here I've never felt like somebody was about to say what are you some kind of dumb shit yeah I gotta go cuz I felt like we were constantly on the verge of that and it was kind of like freezing up my brain it this has never happened to me before and and and it's I mean he he is who he is which which is great I mean it's got to make good audio it's believe me it ain't it isn't easy to be in the in the way of that thing but it's I'm sure it'll make good good audio it's a very very important story yes and it needs to get around and he's also very lively exciting voice yeah he understands that you just want the story to speak for itself but that you have to make some appearances so that it doesn't look like you're hiding from the smears and the attacks because that could make that could give them ammo and say see he's not talking he's not answering whatever that that means we cout him into silence or something so you're kind of between a rock and a hard place there so he is gonna talk to some people and I'm really honored that he talked to us first I'm glad as hell I talked to him and yeah and I hope to talk to him more and again I mean I it's like preparing for the show I had so many things I wanted to talk about so many notes so many like books marked up bookmarked articles out there and then and then talking to him okay come on come on what's this I get to go I get to go you're gonna come on I gotta go yeah yeah I know I could heal right yeah but radio is forever I think I lean quotes Michelle you're of the Hong Kong film industry saying that she doesn't mind doing stunts because bruises heal but cinema is forever and radio is forever too yeah let that be your inspirational poster yes that'll that'll get me through the night the sleep if I can do it yeah that in sleeping pills anyways I I don't know anything else you want to add to that I think the interview just so it speaks for itself and the article speaks for itself and I'm just glad that that we're able to get that and and that's it thanks again I mean you know to all of our subscribers and make the show possible and this is all for you and talk to you again soon John okay thanks everybody thanks mark in particular okay let's get to it yeah bye um",
