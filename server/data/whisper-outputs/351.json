    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. Today is October 21st, 2022. And this is episode 351 on the Ghost Mark Games in Monroe County, upstate New York. And I'm going to line with Gary Brecher, aka John Dolan, aka The Warner in Trieste in Italy and John. How you doing? Oh, okay. I mean, considering that we've been trying to get our petrimesso di sojuan, no, this week. What's that mean? Permission to stick around. And that has meant standing in line outside the questura, which is like the local police, bureaucracy headquarters. And I mean, we've encountered strict fairness, which meant that we spent 10 hours standing in line this week, not allowed to sit down. And it's been great for my knee. And I've been thinking of various apocalyptic scenarios. But they finally took our fingerprints because I'm one of those people who is full of rage, but is also a complete coward. So I spent the whole two hours waiting in line trying to come up with the correct Italian in order to make one final denunciation. And it sort of worked like it got through to the cop who finally let us in and then personally apologize to us in his perfectly decent English, at which point I felt really bad for the rest of the day. I mean, I can explode a little bit, not enough to impress Saudis. They used to laugh at me when I try to explode. Definitely enough to impress Canadian border guards and some other border guards, but it takes a great deal out of me. Yeah. So you denounced him? No, not him, but the system. I said, sir, we've been waiting here the entire week, which is true. We've been there nine to 11 every day this week. And my knee can't take that. So you're not allowed to sit down. If you sit down on the concrete steps, even if you manage not to think about everybody who peed there in the past few decades, they come along and roused you. And you know, I'm an old man. It's kind of degrading to be rousted at my age. Yes. So when do you find out if you get the permiso to stay? Well, it should be pretty soon. He said, but who knows? I mean, in Calabria, they lost our application and then kicked it up the idiotic to Triestas or who knows? Right. Okay. All right. Well, today we're going to have a great conversation with Samuel Bande to help kind of fill in a lot of, I don't know, fill in sort of gray areas for us and clarify for us a lot of questions we've had about the drone side of the Ukraine Russia war. And he really knows his stuff and it's a great interview. Before we get to that real quickly, we can't not say a little something about what's going on in Britain. I know. And I mean, I think we owe it especially to our American listeners who sometimes feel that they're the goonier of the branches of the Angloid world. And you know, the angloids are just goonie. You can't help it. But it's like the UK has been doing its bit to show that posh accent or no posh accent. There is goonie as anybody. I mean, like Liz Truss lasted 44 days and looked like a fool every single moment of those 44 days. And now, like one of the candidates for PM, the one who's declared first her name is Penny Mordont. And her slogan, I swear to God, is PM for PM. Oh my God. And the minute I saw that, I thought, guys, this is not high school. You're not running for student body president. Exactly. That's the first thing I thought. I seem to remember my dad, I think, had run was maybe a president in his junior high or high school, whatever. And he wanted me to run for something and I thought, no way. Like no one would work for me. But he's like, I already have the slogan. It was like, don't go ape, go aims or something like that. One for me. I was like, yeah, this isn't the 50s anymore. Yeah, that's right. But unfortunately, I ran. I had tried to revote someone, leave that to me. You were the insurgent character. Yeah, the insurgent's lost. Yeah. So PM for PM. I have to say, the one thing that surprised me about trust is it was the first time, I mean, we saw this train recombin, you know, when she was foreign minister, it was unbelievable that they chose her, that she was the one who rose to the top to become briefly prime minister. But it was the first time where by any objective measure, the UK leader was just objectively stupider than the American leader. And I don't really recall, well, I guess on, I guess, I mean, not, you know, a woman Clinton by sort of IQ level, I guess you say high IQ levels, they'd have their terrible politicians. But I just don't remember thinking, wow, those people across the corner really dumb. Like that's supposed to, that's our thing, man. Or maybe we got it from the, she's dumb as there always glib. Or yes, trust wasn't very glib, but usually they can complete a sentence and even a paragraph right on, on the spot. And American politicians don't do that. Although I've begun to wonder if that too is a strategy that Americans dislike articulate people. And yes, are more convinced by the aporia where you finished speaking halfway through the sentence and let the interlocutor finish it. So I don't know. Yeah. I, there was this funny moment captured in, well, leaked or whatever in, in Andrew Coburn newsletter. This is a couple of weeks ago describing Biden's first meeting with her. I think this was right when she was going to become prime minister. And they had a meeting together. And she says to Biden, she has two things of them. One, bring down global energy prices and two, enforce a total cutoff of all Russian oil exports. And Biden understood, well, if we do a total cutoff like blockade of Russian oil exports, then obviously global energy prices will rise. Like you can't do that. It's just so he doesn't know that then. Yeah. So Biden knows that. And he's going to be doing the meeting. He told his aides that the new British leader was quote, really dumb. I quote. Well, this is live. I've told his people the same thing. Remember, we encounter with Lafayl, where somebody, some sly aides slipped Lafayl, got you a question for her, which was, well, do you accept Russian sovereignty over Rostov? And she said, and Vaternezh, yeah. And she said in imitation, that's remote. We will never accept Russian authority over. Yeah. Right. And that was then like a lot of her apologists in the media, a lot of blue checks were saying, oh, this was a classic KGB disinformation technique, you know, asking a question about something that, you know, trick, trick, I mean, it was, it was really, yeah, she is embarrassing in that way. And I mean, if you have Biden who is riddled with dementia, I mean, pretty clearly, like half the time he's shaking hands with the air, he doesn't know what room he's in. And to him, she was really dumb. Like that was amazing. And I was kind of thinking like in those evolution of man or devolution of man, you know, that illustration where the A turns into whatever and downwards. I mean, you have better posture. Yes. You have, thinking about the Tories here, and it's not like David Cameron was any great shakes. He was a complete fucking idiot. He's the one who thought, okay, I'm going to end all this yammering about Brexit by holding a referendum. Who, you know, that worked out well. So but going from Cameron, who could at least speak to then, you know, May, who was, you know, somewhat degenerate from that to then Boris Johnson, who now looks like, you know, pit or something compared to, compared to trust and then down to trust. I mean, there's a clear devolution there. Yeah. It's kind of, it's kind of shocking to see. And it does feel like it feels like things are breaking down. It does have that feeling like we're at nearing the end of something. But then there's another side of you that says, well, this can go on and on for a while. I know. I'd just like to live long enough to see that and to see them bring back the mammoth. That's all I asked. Yeah, they're working on that working on the man. Actually that's a, I think the Russian scientist with American and European. Absolutely. I will, I will die for the Jakut Tondra if they bring it back. Yes. I mean, I'm not sure how usefully I could die. I could wait in place to say, hi, how are you to invaders and then press a button? That's what all I could do. All right. And speaking of Tondra, I guess, Russia, I don't know, this is my sad attempt at doing a transition here. But let's get to our great interview about drone technology, mostly on the Russian side because that's his expertise. That really on just drone warfare in general today and of the last 10 years with Samuel Bendet. Let's get to the interview right now. Okay. We are really excited and honored to have with us today Samuel Bendet. He is a researcher at the Center for Naval Analysis in Washington, D.C. where he works at the Russia Studies Program with Michael Kaufman, who we've talked about in the show. Samuel's fluent in Russian. He specializes in Russian defense and technologies, particularly drone unmanned technologies and AI technologies. And he's advised various branches of the U.S. government on military tech matters. He's also an adjunct senior fellow with the CNAS and listed in your bio, you're an honorary mad scientist with the U.S. Army's training and doctrine command, mad scientist initiative. Definitely going to have to ask about that. He's published in various defense oriented publications, co-authors and reports, which we read and we'll talk about in the show for the CNA on Russian and Ukrainian drone tech used in the war. So first of all, thanks for coming on the show Samuel. Yeah, thanks for having me and I really appreciate it. The mad scientist part, an honorary title. So mad scientist project is part of the U.S. Army trade-docs training and doctrine command. It is an effort to look into the impact of advanced and emerging technologies on U.S. military operations. It's a very interesting project. And so I've spoken and presented there before. We've done a lot of presentations on the development of Russian military autonomy in AI with the mad scientist team. And so in the end, they've given me an honorary title. So I have a little plaque that says I'm an honorary mad scientist. Wow. So you're not a villain who's planning to blow up the world then? No, I'm not planning to blow up this world. No, there's some slip over in that category. You start out with the best intentions in the world. But I noticed that because a lot of our fans are also into science fiction that Greg Brenn, science fiction writer has a lot of connections with the mad scientist initiative as well. And it's good to know the Army is willing to engage science fiction nerds and get them thinking about what might happen or how things might be. They actually have a writing contest when they ask junior officers to write a short science fiction story incorporating today's emerging technologies and their evolution in the future. And I've actually been a judge of that contest and it was really interesting because you have a lot of talent out there. And a lot of these young officers were really describing things that we're starting to see today. Wow. So there's some good quality writing as well. I guess a lot of sci-fi fans in your program there, is that right? Well, so I'm not part of US trade-doc. Right. Or the program that you were working in. Yeah. So, well, okay. So, yes, there are actually a lot of science fiction fans within the mad scientist team at the doc. Right. But within my CNA Russia Studies program, yes, we have a lot of science fiction fans. There's always a very interesting discussion debate about Star Trek and Star Wars. And other franchises where a lot of interesting military trends are displayed and discussed. So, yeah. So CNA Russia Studies program, as I'm sure you've heard from Michael Kaupin before, where we were stood up officially some 20 years ago, but it was a low level effort. We expanded in 2015 with the advent of Russian military threat in Eastern Ukraine and Syria. And today, we are nine full-time staffers looking specifically at the Russian military technology, Russian military doctrine, how Russia fights, why fights, what kind of technologies it uses and why, where it prioritizes its development. And within that team, I am looking at the development and evolution of Russian military autonomy robotics and artificial intelligence. And I've been doing that since around 2017, 2018. Right. Well, your program, I mean, it just has to be said here, your program was one of the very few analysts who really got the invasion right. I mean, I know you guys are pretty surprised by the actual, like, the way Russia actually conducted its invasion and its military tactics and strategies. But you guys called the invasion right. And so that just has to be pointed out here. And I'm sure that helped the, you know, the credibility of your program in a pretty big way. And you guys have been calling a lot of stuff right since the invasion as well. So. Thank you. Yes. A lot of our work is with the open source information. So we do a lot of open source analysis, a lot of public data analysis. And now, obviously, with the word Ukraine, there's an absolute explosion of information and multiple data points on different types of Russian military warfare aspects and how Russia fights again, white fights, what it does and what it doesn't do. And of course, looking at the Ukrainian military and Ukrainian capabilities and tactics as well. Right. So I think without having to go actually, you know, far back into the history of drones and what the US developed in the first Israeli use, et cetera, et cetera. I think and you talk about this also in one of your reports. A good place to start really is sort of is the Syrian war. I mean, drone use and the way we're starting to understand it today. A lot of it seems to have come out of the experience in the Syrian war where on the one side, the rebels were able to take real sort of like commercial low tech drones and use them for everything from surveillance, you know, and reconnaissance to actually dropping munitions and stuff. But with really cheap drones. And then of course, the Russians, when they came in in a big way in, what, late 2015, but I think after that, they started testing out a lot of their drone technologies there. And I would imagine the Iranians who were now talking a lot about because of the Shaheed 136. I would imagine they probably tested a lot of their drone technology there. So can you tell us, you know, what lessons, what went on in the Syrian war in terms of the evolution of drone warfare and sort of, you know, what lessons were drawn? Yeah, you're right. And pointing out that Syria really was kind of the youth rush for Russia's use of and application of UAVs in combat. There are several sort of major trends that Russia traced there. So trend number one was Russian military was able to get battlefield video feed for the first time in real time because they had a persistent UAV presence over Syria transmitting information. And that phrase in real time was really new because if you go back to the pre-2015 reports about Russian ISR and reconnaissance capabilities, that phrase isn't really present a lot. And of course, satellite imagery is more expensive. It's more fickle. If suddenly Russia has the capacity to get data from a range of different UAVs from very close support range, UAVs like LRON-3, to UAVs that fly further out like Orlan-10 and Zastava or Zaladrones. And then drones that range out up to 250 kilometers, the four post R and different other drones that were also trained out in this conflict. And the lesson Russia took from this war is that it could have a relatively permissive environment for its UAVs and ISR in general. Of course, that was one of the lessons, but it was the wrong lesson to apply to Ukraine. Because in Syria, Russia really didn't have a lot of countermeasures directly against their drones. By the Syrian rebel by the anti-SF forces, those forces did not have sophisticated EW electronic warfare. They did not have sophisticated air defenses. They didn't have sophisticated radars. And even though Russia did lose some of their UAVs from possibly to ground fires, it really wasn't until the start of Ukraine war when it became clear that Russian UAVs are actually susceptible to the adversarial countermeasures, especially to a technologically advanced adversary that Ukraine has become. And so in Syria, Russia learned how to fly different types of UAVs that were flying them around the clock. At one point, they said they had something like 70 to 80 UAVs in the air at any given time over Syria, which was another first for them. But again, they did that in a relatively permissive environment. At the same time, Russian military bases and military key sites were under attack by the anti-SAD coalition. And so there were multiple attacks on the main-meam air base by relatively unsophisticated simple drones which were launched in the group at the Russian base. And back then, they claimed that they're echelon defense. Defends that combines early-warning radar, electronic warfare, jamming capabilities, and anti-aircraft systems like Ponset and Tor were able to deal with all of them. Of course, not a caveat is that these were very simple drones. They were not sophisticated. They were certainly not the drones that are manufactured in Turkey or Iran today. We also have to mention that EW as an anti-drone or counter-drone principle works very well. Because in 2018, US military publicly complained that American drones flying in Syria were buzzed by Russian EW systems. And Russians were able to track and interfere with that operation as well. We mentioned Iran. Obviously, since Iran supported the Assad coalition, I believe later on, and some of the Assad forces were flying their UAVs in Syria as well on behalf of the government in Damascus. But I don't have a lot of information about that. It really wasn't well publicized. But we were aware from all kinds of sources that Iranian proxies, Iranian allies in Syria were also there to combat anti-SAD coalition. So basically, bottom line, everybody had drones in the air at one point or another at different lengths and different ranges and in different altitudes. And so Russia basically claimed that their drone age has arrived with the application in Syria. Russian top brass like General Gerasimo and Shogu were saying how drones are absolutely essential to modern warfare. The modern warfare does not exist without the application of drones as ISR, as common elements. And of course, starting with 2015-2016, there was a realization in Russia that having ISR drones is not enough, seeing the target is not enough. You need immediate capacity to strike the target once it's been identified and tracked. And so, Russians noted back then that they don't have enough combat drones, like the ones that are flying in the American and Israeli and Chinese military. And emphasis was placed on development of those drones, so 2016 going forward. Right. So, we went forward six years later and Russia invades Ukraine. What is clearly visible, and I'm sure this was discussed earlier, and I'm not going to belabor the thought, is that this was a very different military execution than the ones that we as analysts have expected. And then the ones that Russia itself trained in different engagements, drills and exercises. So, when everything was so different, having ISR drones really... ISR for our listeners, ISR's intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, right? That's correct. Yeah, okay. Yeah, so the main difference is ISR and the USAV, which can strike as well as they can look down and strike. Yeah, and many combat drones are also ISR drones. In fact, a combat drone by definition is going to have a sensor package that will include camera. Right. And so, it will be able to act as a significant or relatively powerful ISR platform as well as a combat platform. Right. So, Russia's execution of the war in Ukraine early on in the first weeks and the first months, obviously, have revealed a lot of problems and issues. Those issues were really... I mean, those issues couldn't be helped by lots of Russian ISR drones that they finally deployed after several weeks out. This war exposed the fact that Russia went into this conflict without a significant number of combat UAVs and with a very small number of loitering munitions. But also for Russia, it wasn't just Syria that was a big lesson. Nagorno-Karabakh War of 2020, which was fought right on their doorstep, was also a major wake-up call because it displayed two relatively small countries with relatively small budgets compared... One compared against, so, significantly larger budgets of Russia and other major powers, countries like Azerbaijan are able to acquire a very significant and capable drone line. And so, one does not need to have a big budget to have a very effective UAV force. And obviously, several major lessons from that war that Russia has wrote about a lot was, first of all, any military power of fighting and modern conflict must have persistent and plentiful ISR platforms, combat platforms, I mean combat UAV platforms and loitering munitions. So, coming country drones. And obviously, to counter that, a military force that may be in the receiving end of these technologies used must have counter UAS and robust air defenses. Sorry, it's not like these are new lessons. It's not like there's like, you know, it was like described in the Gilbert comics, the blinding flash of the obvious. These are obvious lessons. As the technology evolves, you need defenses against the technology, as aerial capability like UAV's evolve, they become more sophisticated and branch out into different types, such as combat, such as ISR, such as loitering munitions. And so, Russia, you needed to have all of that. And it had that in very small numbers. Its defense industry was just starting to sort of manufacture this technology in any capacity. And of course, again, when it invaded Ukraine, a lot of things went wrong. A lot of things went wrong for lots of reasons. Reasons that we're unsure discussed earlier. But Russia ultimately started fielding its UAVs, but it started fielding its UAVs, especially ISR UAVs against the very capable adversary, very well prepared. The very adversary that was taking a lot of notes and was learning from Russia's own experience in Ukraine, in Syria, and obviously from other wars as well. And so, Russian UAV fleet encountered very capable counter-UAS capabilities. And so, Russia started losing a lot of their ISR drones. And its very small number of combat UAVs was relegated to providing ISR capabilities at a distance where drones like Fort Post and Orion were flying basically a thousand or two thousand kilometers out. Wow. Providing persistent coverage via the cameras and sensors. Right. There were a lot of videos they predobinated in the early weeks of the war showing Russian convoy's just rolling blind into ambushes with anti-tank weapons. And the obvious question to ask was, well, why weren't they using drones? And especially after Nagorno-Karabakh, I know there was some resistance in the Armenian and Nagorno-Karabakh upper ranks to the importance of drone. There's a famous quote by one Armenian officer saying, those things are expensive. You can do the same with cheap weapons. Was there that kind of resistance in the Russian command? You know, I asked that question also as kind of the first hours of the invasion turning to days and as the days turn into several weeks, I asked, well, where the hell are the drones? You know, Russians have them. They drill with them. They practice with them. They constantly write about these UAVs as absolutely essential ISR elements working together with artillery units working with ground force units. And I don't have a good answer why those drones were not utilized. Again, I think, and this probably was discussed before, Russians were preparing for a different type of adversary. They thought they would just roll in. And this would be a very quick conflict and in Russia's favor very quickly. And by the time they rolled out their ISR drones, mostly ISR drones to really observe the battle space and to provide information to their own forces, the initiative passed to Ukraine as far as capable defense force that was able to significantly atrit and degrade Russian military capabilities. But yes, those were the questions a lot of people were asking as the column is rolling into the enemy territory. You need aerial capability at a few kilometers above. And such capability could have been provided even by commercial quadricompters. But Russians didn't have that for whatever reason and for lots of reasons. So for many reasons, the reasons that I don't doubt we will be discussing for years to come. But Russians were able to reorganize a few weeks out to like a few months out. And they finally kind of brought out their Orlantan, Eleorant 3 and other ISR drones. They started to slowly roll out their forepost R. And they're very, very few Orion drones. They started rolling out Zalodrones made by Kalashnikov. And this takes us into another evolution of this conflict and another sort of major evolution of the use of UAVs in war. And that's the use of commercial technology in commercial quadricompters. You alluded to that early on when you mentioned that some of the anti-SAT Syrian rebels started using commercial technology to provide reconnaissance, to scout the territory to drop simple bombs. When Ukraine, this capacity really exploded and no pun intended. Because Russians very quickly found out that despite availability of some ISR drones, they really didn't have enough. So Russia went into the war with about 2000 or so UAVs, all UAVs, all classes. And that wasn't enough because they started losing them at a significant scale and a significant rate. I understand there's been a sort of race between Ukrainian supporters and Russian supporters to contribute these. The one I hear about is the DJI Mavic series drone. Just hear it. Send them a drone. Exactly. Exactly. And so Russians very quickly found out that despite only official statements, despite only official press releases, despite some of the highly publicized war games and drills and exercises, they just did not have enough tactical drones. These are drones that can range just a few miles out. The drones I could see just above that hill or beyond hill, just in the forest or even just around the corner. And Russian soldiers were very public in these complaints. And frankly, I was surprised that these public complaints made it into the official Russian media. Not if media like Rianovistia or Zvezia, but regional newspapers, online publications were very vocal in highlighting the fact that many of their soldiers who were sent to the front were quote unquote, blind as kittens. Right. Because they could not see just a few miles out. And that contributed to major intelligence failures, possibly leading to Ukrainians, a very successful counterattack around the market that pushed Russians out. And so Russians really enabled to sort of fill the tactical gap from their official state military order from the official state military coffers. They turned to fundraising. They turned to volunteers. And this is where you get this raise for DJI drones, Mavic series, Mavic 2, Mavic 3, Mavic Pro, DJI Air and multiple other models, which are really very simple to use, very cheap, very robust, highly expendable, but provide excellent capability, excellent tactical capability to see a few miles out to basically cover a given area, a few square kilometers, a few square miles. And then of course, both sides started essentially turning these UAVs into combat UAVs by attaching munitions grenades and bombs. I remember Islamic State was doing that in Mosul, even as the popular mobilization groups were pushing into Mosul. They would just get a quadro drone and attach a grenade to it and just have it release. And I bet that didn't make the news as much as the use of commercial quadricopters as ISR and combat elements in this war because this war is playing out on social media in a time. So if you go to TikTok, if you go to Twitter, if you go to other platforms, if you follow certain telegram channels, and especially telegram channels, that's where a lot of Russian and Ukrainian bloggers are and that's where a lot of the activity is taking place, especially fundraising for these commercial drones. You can get updates literally by the hour and you can have the war brought on your smartphone. And so this capability using social media to fundraise and to have people who want to donate literally select the unit and the battalion and the division where this will go is really unprecedented, especially in the Russian side. This is what I'm tracking as part of the work. There are certain telegram channels that have millions of followers, millions of subscribers. I wanted in leopard skin print. Obviously jokes aside, they are requests coming from these channels for very specific DJI models that you can donate to. And they give you the banking amount or any transfer money transfer information and you can donate however much you can. So on the Russian side, this isn't just the LNR DNR, the militia groups from the break-away area, but these are actual Russian units. It started with LNR and DNR. They became the trailblazers. They opened a training center in Donbass, the train drone operators and the MOD initially, it's not like it resisted but it didn't really interfere with that either. So this evolution and this application of commercial drone technology in the war became organic bottom-up movement with soldiers using these technologies and finally Russian and MOD and saying well of course it's a very useful capability. Are they influenced by Ukraine in this way? Because I've seen this happening, volunteers buying drone technology for the Ukrainian side since I feel like almost the beginning of the war. Absolutely, they absolutely are. In fact, they noted earlier that the American advantage and quadrucopters early on in the war has since been level because Russians were able to fundraise and buy plenty of them as well. So what the volunteers have done closer to the end of August of December is they actually organized the MEDA, a hackathon of sorts. And Ukrainians were doing that on their own, bringing together military civilian experts and drone operation, drone technology to really develop successful solutions for the Ukrainian military. The Russian volunteers have done the same on their end and they called the event Dronyetsa, which is obviously a play of words on the word drone and they met in the condition of the North American region in Russia. 300 people showed up civilians in military and they were testing out drones. They were running military drills based on experience in Ukraine. They were really trying to come up with ideas how to better and fast the train drone operators but also create a train-the-trainer program where individuals could train other trainers who can then take this exponentially outward and train multiple drone operators at once. And there is evidence that some of that is finally becoming part of the Russian military's doctrine and tactics because I'm tracking multiple drone centers across Russia offering this type of quadrucopter training to the newly mobilized forces and it looks like some of that training is finally done under the Ministry of Defense's auspices although it's not clear how these efforts are still interconnected because it looks like they're not. I got to say, so first of all Samuel, are you a drone hobbyist at all? Well, I don't like one. Certainly, hobbyist. I mean, I look at this information daily and it's really something as far as... So, well, I was just going to say, so my wife got me a drone, a really cool drone with the camera that, you know, and it hooks to an app in your phone for Father's Day a couple of you during the pandemic when everyone was locked in. And I've used it a few times. It was too addictive almost. It was like gaming. Yes. I don't know if other people describe it as that but you could hit it. Okay, so it's like gaming but it's kind of more intense because it's real rather than on a screen. And so I want to seize that on that because for the Donbass volunteers, they actually want gamers. Right, I was going to be part of the drone workforce because drone racing, drone operations, video games is young people's game. Yes. And so some of those efforts involving drone training, quadrocopter training in the Donbass actually involved, involved gamers of different types, cybersecurity professionals, involved military combat veterans, but especially gamers because these are the people who are very familiar with this technology. It's totally organic to their lifestyle. Yes. And of course, when you donate a quadrocopter to, let's say, Russian Ukrainian military, don't just donate the quadrocopter, you have to buy batteries, you have to buy a phone or an iPad of some kind, right? You need to buy other accessories, you need to buy a flash drive. So it's an entire high-tech ecosystem and the more familiar you are with it, the more comfortable you are with it, the better drone operator you're probably going to be. And I think both sides are banking on that. Right. God, are we going to have child drone operators? You know, like this new, yeah. Drone racing is a very popular sport world-owned. Right. Yes. Including Russian, including Ukraine, including United States. And again, the more comfortable an individual is with this type of technology and usually that tends to be younger people, right? The more successful they are. Actually, I do want to know that on fundraising for quadrocopters, Russians actually said, please don't send us racing drones because those are different drones from the regular DJI Mavic 2 or 3 and it takes a long time to master the operation. But they're more Ukrainian. Right. On the Ukrainian side, we see evidence of people using VR goggles and flying these drones as kamikati drones and Russian target. Wow. Yeah. That's crazy. So what we have, right? So what we have is this sort of overlapping complementary developments, military type drones, which are built by the military industrial complexes of all major belligerents, as well as commercial drone technology, which evolved in many cases separately from the military industrial complex. Right. DJI controls more than half of the commercial drone market right now. Wow. And no matter how much DJI can say that they're not selling their drones officially in Russia or Ukraine, there are probably tens of thousands of these drones available in global market places. And this is where the Russians and Ukrainian volunteers go to acquire these drones for the world. I was going to ask about that. So DJI officially says we don't sell to belligerents on either side. Right. And once that a couple months ago, they said they're not going to sell these drones officially in Russia or Ukraine to which the Russian volunteers, especially said, hey, go to Eastern European, Middle Eastern, for a Soviet and South Asian market places, especially online platforms and just get those drones there. Right. That makes sense. So let me back up a little bit here. So going back to the Nagorno-Kutabakh conflict in 2020 between Azerbaijan and the Armenian forces. One thing I remember from Russian patriot, nationalist, pro-military, social media was, correct me if I'm wrong, but I have this memory of it, was outrage, this realization and an sense of outrage from the Russian side, that they felt that Russia was actually the war that exposed that Russia was actually way behind. Not just because the Armenian side didn't have anywhere near Azerbaijan's technologies, Azerbaijan was using Israeli and Turkish technologies and drones, but there was a sense that just kind of exploded out of that. I don't know if you remember this where they were saying we were actually way behind on some of the key areas. Do you recall that at all? I do actually. And this kind of made for some very interesting media analysis because one sentence is the date we're saying yes, Russia is behind because it doesn't have those capabilities at scale. In the other side, usually state commentators were saying no, no, we're not that far behind because we have combat drones, we actually have loading munitions, we have the Lancet and the coup and we have all that stuff. We just need to essentially expand the production. For some reason they just never did. The lessons of Nagorno-Karabakh were clear because the same lessons were applied all across the Middle East in wars and conflicts where drones were utilized. And so what the Nagorno-Karabakh war highlighted was a country that highlighted the fact that a country need not have a very large defense budget in order to have very capable aerial unmanned capabilities, both for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, information gathering for combat as well as loading munitions. And nations with even smaller budgets than Azerbaijan because Azerbaijan has a lot of revenue from oil sales. Right. Even smaller countries today looking at the conflict in Ukraine can say okay, we can maybe make a different selection, maybe we should go for cheap loading drones. The ones that Iran is selling to Russia, the Shaheib 136, 139 and Arashdu and others because those drones could cost as little less and you were between 20 to 30 thousand dollars. That's the number that's cited for Shaheib 136 and Shaheib 131. I mean what's 25k that type of capability, right? How much cheaper is that than procuring even a light aircraft or light ground attack operations? Now we do have to know of course and this is important that oftentimes such drones don't have equal capacity to a light aircraft. That the amount of surveillance or the amount of bombs or munitions that a light aircraft can carry is significantly larger than the same amount or the amount of munitions that could be carried by a drone, even a big drone. But drones are cheaper, they don't involve people if the drone crashes, so be it. Right. Don't lose a pilot, you don't lose an aircraft. It doesn't create political and other issues related to the loss of the pilot, the loss of humans in the war. This is what the Russians basically have been saying for many years. They want to develop this a man robotic autonomous technology because first of all they want to make their missions more effective and second they want to save guard human lives. Their soldiers lives first and foremost and presumably the lives of civilians who could be caught in a conflict because presumably autonomous technologies could be more precise. Of course we're seeing right now in Kiev an attacks on the civilian infrastructure by living drones shows a different side of this technology's application as well by the Russians too. Right. Well, one of the implications of I guess what you'd call the economy of scale is swarming and that seems to be an obvious advantage of cheap drone warfare. You can take right back to, I forget whether it was the Six Day War or Yum Kippur where the Israelis just use very early RPVs as they were called then like the Fire B just to exhaust the Syrian air defenses. When we were referring to the 1982, the drone basically bust all of the air defense batteries that's here in Ted and the drones were followed by aircraft that just destroyed them which led to a very lopsided tower. 1982, not long. So this technology is not new and Soviet Union during the Cold War was one of the major drone flying powers except these were different types of drones. They're more like flying missiles and these drones would fly over a certain area and then they would have to come back and jettison the camera to be procured by operators. So this wasn't acquiring data in real time. The evolution of high tech of commercial microelectronics is enabled smaller, lighter platforms that can now do this in real time via a commercial quadricopter that can cost just a few thousand dollars and provide a very significant capability to an entire platoon or even company of soldiers on the ground. Right. One of the problems is that the weapons, especially when you're using something like surface to air missile, it's a very expensive weapon and very precision oriented and you're sending an intense that's cheap twenty thousand dollar junker. Well, yeah, and there's two ways of looking at it. So obviously, yes, the cost of shooting down these drones must come down if this were to become an effective defense at the same time at the same time. The cost of letting that drone through, it also be quite horrific. So sometimes expensive munitions is used, expensive missiles have to be used against these drones so that it doesn't penetrate the civilian aerospace. Right. Which creates a real dilemma for the defender. Right. Going back to that similar world of Russian patriotic social media or pro-military social media, I recall, I think from one of your Twitter threads as well, I think you quoted and translated somebody when Russia started having some major losses, like starting at the very end of August beginning of September when the losses are starting to become very clear. And there's been this sort of weird period, like a kind of glassnost within the pro- you know, online anyway in the last few weeks from the Russian side because they've had so many losses talking about what's going on. And I remember you quoting this one big post that went into detail about Russian unmanned, the whole failure to deploy proper drone technology unmanned systems and that they had actually the infrastructure for it. They had the money allocated for it sort of like a scope of a sort of internet or high tech park sort of thing. So that a lot of it was just stolen or it just be like there's a lot of talk about, you know, the Russian military corruption. I think probably a lot of it is sort of overdone. But in the high tech area, I don't know, it seems like there might be more truth to it. Do you recall what I'm talking about? Yes. And this critique came from multiple Russian telegram channels where they end with a significant following, significant influence that really kind of were raging because they were on the ground in the Dombas basically yelling into their phone to their followers. What is going on with a domestic defense industrial complex? And how is it that I ran was able to manufacture these loading munitions from literally mud and dirt. I'm using a word for mud. They use something else. Right. From mud, dirt and sticks, that's what they said. And put it out in the field and huge huge defense enterprises like like Rostek, for example, sitting on their billions of rubles, trillions of rubles, weren't able to do so. And of course, this begs the question, larger question, again, something that we will be looking at in more detail as to what actually happened to the defense and industrial complex. When it comes to the responding to the speed of the necessity, right, the speed of need. How quickly can this defense industrial complex turn around and deliver something important? There are indicators that some of that may be turning around. Yesterday, there was news that Russian defense industrial complex probably Rostek itself delivered up to 1500 Landsat loading munitions to the front. And that's a significant number. But Landsats fly at no more than 40 kilometers. And even though they can strike targets at a significant distance from the main contact line, it's only 40 kilometers, right? Shahads can fly several hundred kilometers. Anywhere from 200 to several thousand, although I'm not sure about that higher end. But for the war in Ukraine, a range of 250 kilometers would place most of Ukrainian civilian industrial military infrastructure within the range of these drones. And so there's going to be a lot of questions, probably about a finger pointing. Russian state doesn't like to air out its dirty laundry. So the state media is kind of lump on some of the issues. What they do like to talk about is how many Ukrainian drones they've shut down and how many drones they were able to send into the field. So if, in fact, that claim of 1500 Landsats is true, then that's a significant capability. The one that we will start seeing very shortly. But if it's not true, then again, it exposes a significant issue in prioritization. And high tech development in Russia can general, especially as part of the state armaments order. And of course, Russian defense enterprises are manufacturing drones. They are developing them. They are testing them. The question is at what scale? And I think when Ukraine exposes the problem of scale because suddenly, both belligerents need very large numbers of different types of drones. And this is where international partners like Turkey and Iran were able to step up for Ukraine and Russia respectively. Yes, so it seems drones are a great opportunity for mid-range powers like Turkey or Iran to compete with bigger power like the US. I mean, they can't compete when it comes to something like fifth generation fighters or whatever, but they can compete in drones. Well, actually, when it comes to Turkey, I think the question whether Turkey can manufacture a lineup similar to that of the US is, you know, it's a much more interesting question because Turkish baraktari and TAI companies are manufacturing drones that are basically on the part with many of the more advanced US-Israeli and Chinese drones. And this development is only going to continue. So the Anka, the Axelengur, Long Range, high altitude drones, obviously Turkish baraktari and some of the cheaper and smaller ones that they offer have become kind of the go-to drones from any powers. There are like two dozen nations, I think, around the world right now, which are in the process of acquiring or testing or possibly talking about acquiring these drones, including US allies in Eastern Europe. And now, Iran is bolsting that two dozen nations are also looking at their drone lineup. Possibly the Shahas, the cheap, loiting munitions. Meaning for example, their ally Venezuela, which already operates Iranian drones and quite possibly Armenia, as an Iranian ally against Turkey and Azerbaijan. So the question of the cost and proliferation, I think, is a different one than a decade ago because a decade ago there are only so many countries that were manufacturing this technology. And really there was no choice but to go to the United States or Israel and maybe China. Now there are recent choice. There's Turkey, there's Iran, and maybe there will be other nations as well. A quick question about the Barak tarz. So we heard a lot about them in the first weeks of the war and they seem to be very effective. Russia claimed that they shot down a bunch of them and I've heard red even, I don't know, potentially somewhat convincing claims that they were vulnerable to certain, they were vulnerable to being shot down by certain Russian capabilities and systems. So I guess the question is what happened to them. We just don't hear about them much anymore. Like what are the Ukrainians relying on if they're not using the Barak tarz as much as they did? Well we actually do hear about them and Ukrainians are using them as stand-up by a Sarc capability. They're not front-to-top drones because as you have indicated, Russians did learn how to shoot them out of the sky because the Barak tarz applied very high, from a relatively large radar signature and they could be a relatively easy brake for sophisticated air defenses. So once Russians got their air defense in EW in order, they started tracking and shooting down Barak tarz, which is why sort of Barak tarz went off the front pages of where I called them. I see. And yes, Ukraine did lose a lot because Russians stepped up their defensive capabilities. But they're still flying, they're still there and Ukraine is still procuring more. And Barak tarz and ISR platform can guide other sensors and packages to Russian targets at a distance. Right. Another question. The success, the military success of the Shaheed 136. Doesn't that show potentially that because one would imagine that the sanctions, particularly the sanctions on technology transfers to Russia would harm their ability to produce good quality drones and to upgrade their drone warfare capabilities. But the Shaheed 136 as far as I know is pretty basic technology. I mean, they buy their tracking systems, their GPS systems from, or guidance systems from Ali Baba, apparently. So does that show a way for Russia to get around or to adapt to the sanctions? I mean, does it mean that the sanctions may not be as effective or I don't know what I'm just wondering what lessons they might be learned from the success of the Shaheed 136? Well, Russia, obviously, turns around because Iran had a ready and available product for Russia. But Iran has been under U.S. sanctions since the mid 80s. Exactly. And they were able to develop a domestic drone industry with mostly domestic parts or parts they could easily source in the international marketplaces, street civilian products. And they were able to turn that into a relatively capable and really scary U.A.D., scary in the sense of what it represents when you use the large numbers. So Russia looks at that experience. And all Russian major announcements about the development of high tech military systems, especially drones and robotics in general, usually end with the same statement that all of that must be developed domestically. Russia can no longer rely on international supply chains for key technologies, especially microelectronics and sensors of computer and hardware. It all must be developed in Russia just like Iran has done with its drones. Right now, sort of at this point in the war, how would you sort of assess, you know, the most recent sort of developments? As you pointed out, you know, in the beginning of the war, the Russian side seemed to be pretty absent in terms of drone and, you know, autonomous technologies at all. And the Ukrainians seem to be doing quite well. And then the Russians seem to have adapted. And then the Ukrainians seem to have adapted. And at this point, I mean, how would you rate each other's capabilities at this point in the war? I think Russians have a very interesting chance in front of them, strictly objectively speaking, trying to force an issue, trying to force an outcome with the use of important technologies. And the US intelligence indicated that the first transfer was several hundred drones. So far, we've seen Shahead 136, 131. We've seen one Mohadjir 6. We have not yet seen Shahead 129 and Shahead 191, which were also named in the package. So we haven't seen a lot of the capability that Russia supposedly has. Russia is supposedly buying over 2000 additional drones for Iran, presumably the Shaheads as well, to continue extracting sort of high costs from the Ukrainian economy, on the Ukrainian civilians, and against some of the military targets as well. Now Ukraine is able to shoot most of them down. I think the official numbers are anywhere between 60 to 85% of these drones are now true. Is that true, you think? I think it is. These drones, the Shaheads, are slow flying. Low flying, they're very loud. And once you kind of triangulate what the sound is coming from, and once you actually sight it, it isn't that difficult to shoot it down in that sense. But it's all about mass. It's all about numbers for these drones. That's why they're cheap. So Russia will continue to send them and waves against Ukrainian targets, civilian and military to force an issue. For Ukraine, they continue using their drones. They continue using both Ukrainian drones, imported drones. They also have their loading ammunition like the Polish made war made, like the switchblade provided by the United States. But switchblade is ultimately a different scale and type of weapon because as I've indicated, Shaheads can fly for hundreds of kilometers. Right, there's a range of like six kilometers or so. It's a very tactical, very powerful, but very tactical weapon. And so obviously Russia's use of these Shaheads isn't going to slow down Ukrainian advance. But it can extract a very high cost from the Ukrainian civilians and from the Ukrainian economy, and especially if they continue striking Ukrainian energy. Energy extraction. Right. Right. Interesting that there's a pattern like a lot of advocates in the US, what used to be RPV world, because I go way back in this as a military nerd. They grumbled that no one was interested because it wasn't glamorous. And you don't get promoted for flying RPVs or UAVs. You get promoted for flying fighter jets. And that changed a bit with the global war on terror where you needed loitering munitions. And it was kind of unglamorous war in general and nobody much wanted to be on the spot. So these were more useful. But in general, there was a real prejudice, at least these people claimed against weapons that were too cheap, too cheap and too ordinary, not flashy and high-tech. Right. This would track well with some developments in Russia, for other. Again, I keep turning to Russia because this is what I study. Right. It would entail a cultural change also with the Russian military to trust and incorporate these systems in an appropriate fashion at appropriate levels. Incorporate the UAV quadrucopter operators with company and battalion commanders, right? Integrate unmanned ground vehicles, combat unmanned ground vehicles, with combined arms forces, and integrate unmanned underwater surface vehicles with surface and underwater combatants and aerial combatants and network all of that into sort of the Russian version of network-centric warfare where all these sensors are talking to each other and to the operators and to the HQ. And of course, this is where swarming comes in. Russians were working on different swarming applications. We haven't yet seen the actual swarm from the Russians. We may not see that for a while because swarm implies parts of the swarm communicating with each other and sort of analyzing the situation as they fly to target. We have mass application, group application, but they're not actually a swarm yet. And so this cultural change is already taken place in the United States. We can see how different branches of the DOD are experimenting with different unmanned and autonomous and robotic vehicles, how they're involving young soldiers at the very sort of low level, at the very tactical level, who will be using these systems, who will be fighting alongside of these systems to figure out what they need and don't need from these systems. And the same was supposed to be happening in Russia this year prior to the war. There were a lot of announcements from the Russian M.O.D. that they were going to experiment with unmanned ground vehicles, combat unmanned ground vehicles. And UAVs in groups. So this year was supposed to be the year of a lot of experimentation. It's not clear if that would actually result in some kind of large scale integration of these systems. But they were supposed to do that at least according to their own announcements. And of course war happens. And it completely saps Russian resource system, reallocates a lot of the pre-ordins. Quick question on autonomous AI sort of warfare. If I remember correctly, I think it was last year in Libya. It was the first, I think it was last year. It was the first sort of known use of an unmanned drone using AI to sort of autonomously target enemy, you know, its enemy soldiers and kill people. Is that being used at all in this war as far as you know? And not as far as I know, we haven't seen the use of autonomous systems to target either adversary. And, you know, there's some sort of conjectures and maybe people jumping to conclusions about Russia's coup and lands at lowering munitions because Kalashnikov implies that there are some level of autonomy in those drones, especially the civilian applications of these drones. And so there were a lot of questions raised whether Russian lowering munitions are truly autonomous systems. And I think the conclusion is they are not. There's still very much human operation and human control. What does the semi-autonomous versus autonomous, like what makes it semi-autonomous? I've seen that. Well, I mean fully autonomous UAB would basically take off on its own, it would fly to target on its own, select the target, analyze the target, determine its an adversarial target and strike it. Right. The semi-autonomous system can take off on land on its own, but a human controls how it reflects the life of target and how it fly. I see. Okay. Okay. So to get a real going back to science fiction, to get a real nightmare scenario going, you need fully autonomous. Yes. Well, actually it's interesting. It's interesting that the Russian military in the writings, and we've highlighted this in our CNA Russia Studies Forum research into the Russian AI and Atomini, a Russian military Russian military academia writes about future conflict as one involving robots. That eventually this would be the conflict of machines with humans sort of far removed from the battlefield, possibly with a finger on the trigger, maybe human on the loop, but certainly not a full human in the loop cycle that is evident today. Right. Terminator. Let's have one more question, since we have here. When you report, you guys published a sort of illustration, and I'll post links to some of this when we post our show, that shows the concept of Russia's reconnaissance fire and reconnaissance strike. The integration of the battlefield with drones, with Orland Tens and Eleoran III's, and then communicating first of all spotting adversary targets, and then communicating with command and control vehicles or people who then communicate to a larger vehicle that is some kind of command center, which then communicates with either how it serves or MLRS systems. It's a pretty complicated network battlefield. I know the US has developed this and used it in Afghanistan and has been around for a little while, but I don't know to what extent this actually describes what goes on in the Russian side in the battlefield, but it also seems fairly vulnerable to counter systems. There's so many links in the chain there. If you were on the Ukrainian side or the adversary side of this chain, what would you want to target first between the drone looking at you, the initial person or vehicle that it's communicating with, the command center? You want to target the drone. You want to take out the drone first. Okay, I always get the drone first. Which is the key link in the chain here, because the whole recon fire, reconstructing the contour that you're referring to really depends on UAVs as persistent aerial assets, which track the target, identify the target, and correct artillery or MLRS or other systems to target. Once you take out the drone via electronic warfare or any other countermeasure, it's seeming jamming basically. Jamming, yeah. Those ground assets lose ice meters basically. Right. Yes. Yes. Oddly like the urban insurgent theory, like kill the spies, take out their vision and then you've got a blind giant to deal with. Exactly. We can probably go on on, but this has been a great interview. Really. I know. Really described a lot. I think our subscribers and listeners will be really grateful to get all this knowledge from you. So, but we don't want to keep it too long. And really thank you, Samuel, for spending the time with us. Thank you, Samuel. You're really appreciate. It was fun. Yeah, it was a lot of fun. Really appreciate it. Okay. All right. Thank you again, Samuel Bendet. I'd like to close the links to his reports and to his Twitter feed, which is always really useful and educational to watch. You learn a lot about the war from following him. Thanks again. Bye-bye. Thank you, bye-bye. Okay. So that was a great interview with Samuel Bendet. I will be posting. We will be posting some links. Should also follow his Twitter feed. John, what stood out for you from what we discussed? Well, it was a great interview. And I think it will be really useful for our listeners. But what struck me above all is something that keeps occurring to me. And that's that there will be a reckoning between cheap swarm versus expensive precision, one of these days. And expensive precision piloted 20th century is going to lose to cheap swarm remotely piloted. And some power, and I can name that power in three letters, is going to pay a terrible price for having backed the wrong technology. Yeah, I mean, you could see like trying to imagine what the corruption was that led Russia to, I mean, look, they had a total, a total of 2,000 drones going into this war. Very few combat drones, mostly more of the, and very few loitering munitions. And mostly, you know, basically surveillance reconnaissance drones, ISR drones. And that was obviously not nearly enough. And when you think about the corruption there, I mean, you can think of an analogous version of it in the US, which is that no one's going to want to produce really cheap drones. No, they want gold plated. Yeah, stuff that can be produced in small numbers with a unit cost through the roof. There's just much more profit that way, not only in the, the unit itself, but the wonderfully lucrative repairs and add-ons that you're sure to get. Whereas when that goes up against cheap drone munitions, you will shoot a lot of the amount of the sky and then you'll have nothing left. Yeah. And what are you going to do then? I was kind of surprised that the Bay Rectars, so they are still being used and effectively, but just not anywhere close enough to where they can get shot down. I was kind of surprised when they really were getting shot down. I mean, I had read about it, read some convincing reports on it, but you know, he seemed to confirm that. Yeah. Every war in the recent past and past few decades really has shown that inventories of munitions get used up much faster than anyone's allowed for. Yeah. Yes. And that's, I guess, another thing that's sort of surprising about how poorly prepared Russia is, but as he's, and his colleague Michael Kaufman, I think of, you know, the Russian side thought they were going to do this sort of lightning campaign. It doesn't everybody think it was going to be sure to go your way in a 20 minute adventure. Yeah. What could possibly go wrong? And yeah, and here we are now month eight and nowhere near, nowhere near ending this war at all. So anyway, that was a great talk with Samuel Bendet. And I think we can wrap up the show. Thanks again, everyone. Thanks, John, Brendan and Samuel and talk to you again soon. All right. Thanks, everybody. Bye.",
