    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. Today today is October 12th, 2022. This is episode 349. I'm the Cosmort Games. I'm here in Rochester, New York, right on the Erie Canal. I'm on the line with the Warner Gary Brichadio, aka John Dullin, and you would now be in Treesd, right? Treesd, yeah. A Treesd, okay. Right in the very southeast little pocket there next to, well, in Sk\u00e5nsd, within sort of you know, former Yugoslavia just about, right? I mean, are you on the board? Yeah, yeah. A lot of the ads that we see are in some kind of Slavic language, which I take to be either Croatian or Slovenian, not sure which. And that's a bit of a surprise because what people speak here is Italian in public places. But that's been going forth, back and forth for a while. I mean, there's a famous urban legend that at one point I guess before World War I, James Joyce, Joseph Djugasvili, Slash Stalin, Adolf Hitler, and some other, I, Owen Freud, I think we're all, they did or they could have, in Triesta, they were all here. Wow. I think it was an Austrian, Austro-Hungarian city at that time. It still hasn't. It's an Austrian-Hungarian look, but we love it here. I mean, it's cooler than other Italian cities, which after spending always in Calabria is a huge relief. And there's wilderness here on the train coming around the curve of the Adriatic. There's a lot of goods, grubby wilderness with stone as soil. And it's quite a relief to the eye when you've been in a place that's heavily populated as northern Italy, because we went to see my brother and sister-in-law in Fierens or Florence. And that didn't work out too well because we got COVID somewhere along the way, or rather, I got it, and then generous as ever, I passed it on to Catherine. So now, after having warned so many people about the dangers of the pandemic, I guess I'm about to show. On this show three years ago or so, I finally got it myself. How would you describe it? Because, you know, funny enough, who else should have got it, but for another show, Yashal Avine, who made like a harrowing escape from Russia with his baby, and on his way back popped into Italy, not where you are and is on his way out. But he and his whole family, everybody got COVID. And he described it as at least the first day, he said, it's unlike anything, any flu he's felt that it was almost synthetic feeling because he hadn't felt exactly that sort of tenor of symptoms before. Like he couldn't really describe it. Is that anything like what you had? Well, no, actually, I mean, it was very familiar to me to the point that I didn't know was COVID. That is in the beginning because it was just like extreme sinus block, except it was more extreme than that. It didn't respond to any over the counter stuff. And since I'm terrified of doctors, that was that. It was as if someone had smacked my nose, the middle of my face with a two by four, and it just absolutely wasn't going to breathe anymore. I mean, I'm normally one of the mouth breathers. I had a famous scene in catacas and when it was still taught by grim Irish nuns, at one point I was told, shut your mouth. What are you sitting there with your mouth open like you don't believe a word I'm saying? I gather years later I realized that must have been some particularly absurd point of doctrine that she was trying to elucidate. And there I was, you know, far side kid with the glasses in the mouth open. Oh my god. She just thought I was registering heretical doubt when really I was trying to breathe lady. That's crazy. Yeah. I guess so. That's it's not and that's not winning over hearts and minds. No wonder. No, the church never had a very good hearts and minds strategy was like, you know, wack the wrists more than hearts and minds. And that's really what doomed it because when people had better options as they did in the suburbs, the church withered almost instantly. But anyway, so anyway, I went through a day of just extreme block sinuses and trouble breathing. But to me, that's that's very familiar. That's like sadly familiar and it was the second night that things got a little weird or though not too weird because that was fever dreams. But I've had fever dreams before the worst. And to me, this, this is an epic memory was in Kuwait where I had something or other. I don't know what it was. You don't go to a doctor in Kuwait if you can help it. I just remember there were two spheres or hemispheres that were just grinding into each other. They were both planet sized and they were both maligned and they were different in some way that made sense only in the dream. So that when you woke, it didn't, you couldn't explain it, but they they were grinding into each other all night and making a terrible, almost mocking noise. And I think a lot of fever dreams are like that when I tried to describe it on Facebook. Yeah, that's unfamiliar. And so I had that kind of dream. That's like IH-O-A-C-O whatever that shit or the STP this and I was. Oh, I was good. Yeah. Well, I'm not crazy enough to try psychedelics at this age, at any age really. But yeah, so I can't confirm that that's what it's like. This just reminds me, I was really pleased to find out very late, much later, long after I had red Philip Dick. Some quote of his where he basically said, hell no, I don't do acid or psychedelics. It was terrifying me. Yeah. Yeah. He's normal. Right. In speed, you're driving the car. It's just going faster. But I mean, you take a psychedelic and something else is driving the car. I mean, yeah, I could feel weird on my own. I don't particularly want to. I know. So, yeah, I think Yasha also, we've got to get Yasha on the show. As soon as he's settled back somewhere, so he could talk to us about Russia, because he was there before, during and after the whole mobilization, escalation and that whole madness in chaos. But he also, he described his fever dreams as he had something like that and he described them. Was he, he, he liked psychedelics, so he's a little different from this. But he described them as almost weirdly comforting. I guess in a, in an STP kind of way. You know, so I really want to get him on the show and have him describe how that held it. Yeah, how that held that makes sense. I mean, the one, the one psychedelic I heard, Yasha described, I think was DMT and it involved. DMT, that's it. Little, uh, Yes. Electric gnomes sitting on a shelf, sneering at him. And that didn't sound so good. Oh, not just sneering, but they, uh, they're sneering at him like from a balcony. And then they reach their fingers that have long extensions with hooks on the end. And they, and they can get it right into your throat and start talking on your soul. Yeah. And I was like, and you do that voluntarily because that's like a, you pay somebody. Exactly. Like, if I was in the CIA, I'd be like, I'm going to bring the goblins back up. You know, tell me where it's like waterboarding, smotherboard, and keep me away from the goblins. Yeah. But, uh, anyways, so, uh, so you're healthy now. I mean, you sound good. So I don't know. Oh, I do. I know. I've seen work. Yeah. They, they definitely made it. I would think a lot easier. Not that I can swear to that. Uh, but, uh, I don't seem to be much worse than I was. I'm coughing up a lot of junk, but I'm always coughing up a lot of junk. Uh, so who knows. But yeah, seems to have passed without, uh, without leaving me in ICU. That's good. Or long COVID apparently too. Yeah. That's, that's the other scary thing about it. Oh, I'll call it the catching. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, I had chronic fatigue or whatever it is. You know, uh, my algebraic and cephalitis, as they call it now, and for two years, uh, my brain didn't quite work right. And that was the most horrible thing at all. Yeah. You think it'll never end. It's terrifying. Yeah. Uh, all right. So let's talk about less terrifying things, tactical nuclear weapons. Oh, there's a piece of cake. Yeah. Comparative chronic fatigue syndrome. Yeah. Well, this is because they've, there have been a lot of headlines, mostly very ignorant and uninformed of headlines about will Russia use tactical nukes? And so we thought it'd be a good idea to talk about what tactical nukes are, um, you know, uh, sort of giveaway here. There isn't a clear definition. So don't expect one. But the question is obviously will Russia use them in Ukraine? And we don't do Ukraine predictions anymore for obvious reasons, but a lot of other people are doing them. Uh, and the story that I like best was what might Russia do with tactical nukes? And they asked some expert from DC. And the expert said, well, they might use them to kill a lot of Ukrainian troops because that would, that would have a, you know, a real negative effect on morale. You think? Yeah. Yeah. That is genius right there. That's, that's worth the think tanks. I'll be right back. Um, yeah, I've heard different, I've heard different people talking about this. I think, I think first of all, one question, um, and this, all these things are kind of open to interpretation. But one sort of, uh, I don't know, argument is did Putin really threaten that? And, um, you know, what he said was something to the effect of, you know, we have weapons that can cause great destruction. And our, you know, our other enemies are people who have ideas. I don't have the text of it right in front of me. You know, should know that, that we can do it. We will defend ourselves by all means. And this is not a bluff. Right. And, uh, and then the question is, so is he threatening to drop tactical nukes and, um, and then his sort of defenders say he's never once said he's going to use nukes and that is just a propaganda whipped up or not even just Putin defenders, let me say, but also sort of anti-war people or whatever. But, um, Washington is kind of hyping that up to further scare us. And my own read of it is he's, he's definitely threatening. I don't know. Uh, I, I think it's pretty, I think it's pretty clear. Um, and he's kind of got in a way to audiences, but one, or maybe even a few audiences, but one of them is just sort of, look, they're losing. And he's kind of reiterating or restating something that if they start losing actual Russian territory, like this is the kind of the, the baseline. If they start losing or having threatened, you know, actual Russian territory, which would include Crimea, right? I think in this case does include Crimean. I think in the most Russians would probably see it that way too, that he would use nukes and he's reminding those people of that and he's reminding his own, you know, defense establishment of, of that as well. And then the other one is more like the kind of ambiguity thing. Uh, you know, just in case it, the, the threat, I mean, it is kind of a bluff, you know, probably, I mean, we don't know, but it's kind of a bluff as a way to kind of so doubt among the various, um, you know, NATO allies, let's say a G7 allies who would have a lot to lose, especially in Europe, and to make them think, well, maybe we should ramp up talking and force some negotiations and, you know, there's something bad could happen. Um, I don't think that's working, but I, so I think it's just, I think it has a couple of messages in that. Sure. And the, the, the straight, uh, threat for the jingoist domestic audience, because he has one of those, just like we got one of those. And, uh, yeah, they need to, they need, I hate that saber rattling thing because sabers are such terrible happens, but, uh, they need to hear that stuff. And a lot of people really believe that stuff. I think one reason Trump did well is that a lot of people really need that kind of rhetoric from the guy appointed as their war chief. And yet if they don't get it, they feel nervous. Um, but yeah, so that followed too, as I recall, I mean, it's very weird, uh, trying to make sense of the news such as it is on Ukraine. That followed a lot of stories about should Ukraine retake rough, uh, Crimea? Yes. And it sounded like a response among other things to that, like, well, yes, if you do that, yes, I, I think so too. Well, I mean, and then there's that other level, um, that is picking up kind of steam the way the US Empire just has so much, so many damn resources to operate on so many level, on so many kind of levels, like, and kind of the more, the more far out reaching level of destabilizing Russia, you know, through propaganda and I don't know, active measures or whatever is this whole notion of decolonization of Russia, right? And trying to whip up, um, all the various minorities to trying to whip up grievances because they may or may not, I think there's evidence that they are, but, you know, who knows what extent, be getting disproportionately targeted in mobilization, disproportionately targeting in, in being, you know, put on the front lines or casualties compared to ethnic Russians. I don't know that that's true, but that, um, is definitely being put out there and, and militaries and nations and history, you know, do have a history, including this country of putting minorities and basically disadvantaged people of all kinds, you know, on the front lines. So there's probably at least a kernel of truth to that. Um, and I, and I think that's, I don't know, it's partly a response to all that talk to. Um, yeah, I have to say, uh, the, uh, the whole US NATO alliance has been pretty impressive. And I don't say that with any joy, but they have, I'm not on anybody's side here. I think it's an abomination, but, uh, they've cohered for one thing. To me, it's astonishing. Like I heard some German politician actually say, I don't care what my German voters think. Yes. This is for you, Ukraine and, yes, I don't know. There's some odd self hatred in, in all that. I don't quite get it, but, uh, they're, they're more loyal to NATO than they are to their own voters. And people seem to accept this, whereas I can't imagine the US facing a frozen winter or economic collapse and saying, yes, but we've got to do it for our NATO allies over there in Europe. And yet it's happening. Uh, somebody described it. Well, I think there's something visceral going on in Northern Europe, something deep in the kind of, you know, the Union historical genes or something about it, the fear of the, of the hordes, the Russian hordes, number one, coming true. And number two, um, an invasion in their general direction, right? It's going, the invasion going westward and a nexing territory. And, um, I think it touched something pretty deep. The, the, the, if I recall, the politician in Germany who made that pronouncement, I don't care of German suffer, you know, we're going to do this for Ukraine. We're going to give them what they want. I think that was the Greens party, one of the top Greens party. So that's the Greens party and they become more popular since then. So this isn't, like this is popular. And I think I, the way I'm sort of trying to make sense of this is more like, um, look, because they're, they're facing real pain Germany in these other places. I'm not sure about freezing, but I'm pretty damn sure I don't see any other way around it. We're definitely looking at long term serious economic industrial decline. Problems financing their, I mean, they're basically giving up their welfare state. You know, so they're looking at a notch down in standards of living because the whole economy is fueled by below market, long term contract piped in cheap Russian gas. There's no other gas in the world over, you know, decades, like you can, you can lock in at a price over decades, you know, exactly how much you're going to get, exactly how much you're going to, it's just not going to happen. And so that's gone. But, um, think about how air, like all the ideas that, um, if you bomb a country from the air, they're, they're, you're going to bomb away their will to resist or sanctions will, you know, kill their will to resist. In fact, that was supposed to happen in Russia with our sanctions and it didn't happen. I think it's kind of maybe similar. I see the Russian leadership and a lot of their supporters seriously believing that a hard winter and a hard economy is going to break Europe. And I'm, I'm just not so sure. It may break somebody, but I'm not sure about like Germany, which is really the center of this. Um, I think it's going to strengthen their resolve. I, you know, I could be wrong, but I think so. It will cause instability. But I, you know, in one degree or another, but, um, not sure they're going to get the result that they're hoping for. No, well, they haven't managed to get many of the results they were hoping for. And that's, yes, that's what, that's what makes me wonder about this European fear, like invasion from the east, some invasion, or some hordes. I know. They're still, I, you know, I'm sorry, but the Russian troops and Wagner and all their best forces have been trying to take not even Buckmute, the tiny town of Buckmute, but Eastern Buckmute, like, for three galladamans. Yeah. Eastern, but so this is like a town that is around the size of this Rochester suburb I live, you know, and they're still trying to get into like, you know, I, I don't know where the Wegmans is here. I mean, it's, and so, and, and I, I think now we know one of the reasons for this is that. It just unbelievably bad, stupid war planning. They have gone in so massively under man and they took a lot of casualties. I mean, I've seen estimates of the Russian forces at least. They're now revising and revising and there's a lot of one thing that's kind of interesting since the disaster, since like Harkov and since losing Lehman actually. A lot of Russian, pro-Russian social media, military, bloggers and so on have been really open about everything. It's kind of like that period where it's like, okay, all the lying isn't helping. It's actually more humiliating. Let's air it all out because there's no way this is going to turn around unless we air it out. And so you learn a lot from them. And it seems that, you know, they may have gone in, well, at least they're, they're BTGs. They may have had as few as like 55 to 60,000 Russian forces on across a 1,000 kilometer front. Now, the figure that was that was tossed around at the time was 190,000, as I recall. So that's kind of a big shortfall. And especially as, you know, plan a failed plan B, I mean, of course they're getting sliced and nice by by the Ukrainians who did a mass mobilization in March. And they're all, you know, trying to defend their homelands. And it's, it's unbelievable actually when you think about the, the, you know, you, I recall some of the most unbelievable poor leadership and military planning in the first church of war. We went over that in our show. Yeah. And I think this, this is the only thing I can compare this to is that. And again, we're leaving aside the morality of what, you know, we're already said we're against this war and invasion and everything. But it's, it's pretty shocking. And so, you know, and I'm not even sure how the mobilization, the mobilization might be able to staunch this to some degree. It's, I mean, maybe the, the new threat is like a way to make the disengagement a little less humiliating God knows could be. But then there's talk of, you know, that, that Putin might break that to boo because he did also mention about US setting a precedent. And I think that's right that, that Russians and, I mean, Russians who watch Putin were more startled by when he said it's America that set the precedent. It's very late Putin speaking and kind of means I've got this goddamn chip on my shoulder. And why can you do it? And I can't do it, you know. And so, you know, you do, I think you do have to take it seriously. I'm not sure that you, what, what you do about it, but you do have to take it seriously. Oh, you do, oh, definitely. I mean, besides Ukraine predictions, no. Yes. So not, not saying whether or not. Graveyard of predictions. I'm not saying whether will or won't, but just trying to figure out what if it did, what does it mean? So that's why we're going to try to do here with, with tactical news. And as I said, most of the articles and they've proliferated over all the mainstream media are remarkably free of any real information. They don't even talk about what a tactical nuclear weapon is. They, this is just the same stuff. Russia has lots of them. We have few of them. The reason for that is that people decided they had no purpose. They tried to use these things. They tried to invent these things because they could. And then they tried to invent a purpose for them, time and again. And it never really worked out. And some of them are some of the biggest jokes in Cold War history. So that the reason the US has fewer of them, well, first of all, if that's true, nobody's quite sure. Is that most of them were dangerous and clunky and were better phased out. So first of all, let's just get the term right. Tactical nuclear weapon. Sounds like it means something. It's not a clear definition. It never has been. Basically, when nuclear weapons were developed, they started out as city destroying weapons. That's what they were for, terror weapons against civilian population. And those came to be called in a nice bit of euphemism strategic nuclear weapons. And they were the focus of all attention. And tactical nuclear weapons, roughly speaking, are everything that isn't a strategic nuclear weapon. They're the non-ICBMs, the little things that people try to use as battlefield weapons. And that they only exist as a term compared to the Doomsday weapons. And everybody knows a lot more about the Doomsday weapons than about these small, weird, supposedly battlefield usable nuclear weapons. And part of this is the difference in Cold War doctrine, military doctrine between the US and US. It's our, the US assumed that maybe you could use some of these cool little small, new gadgets, and we'll talk about what they were in a minute. But maybe you could use them without vaporize a Russian army or two without making Russia too mad, like mad enough that it would use the big ones, the strategic ICBMs, the ones that would make a glowing lake out of Houston or something. The Russian doctrine was Soviet doctrine was much simpler. That's not going to happen. The war is going to, if there's a NATO war, so a pact war, it's going to go nuclear instantly. And it's going to go nuclear all down the line from cities being incinerated to nuclear, tactical nuclear weapons being used to destroy enemy compounds, enemy armored formations, and troop concentrations. So if anything, the Soviet was probably more realistic because they at least face the fact that it was going to go nuke in a big way, which, as it turns out, is probably why that war never happened. So a tactical nuclear weapon to the extent that term means anything, it's a small, smaller than the Doomsday weapon, more likely to be used on the battlefield, roughly speaking a shorter range, and a much smaller yield, as they call the power to cause nuclear explosions. It used to be one kiloton to 50 kilotons, and those are small, made it tactical. A kiloton is roughly equivalent to the explosion of one ton of TNT, that metric ton, 2200 pounds, a thousand kilograms. So that's a pretty big explosion anyway. 50 kilotons would still be by most people's definition, quite a big firecracker. But of course, we're comparing two things that are not meant to be on a human scale at all, and the other comparison is to the strategic stuff. And those got really scary. And they can go from 100 kilotons to, I mean, some of them are pretty small now, I tried and submarine the missiles on that are 150 kilotons. So they're not particularly big. But keep in mind, the Hiroshima bomb was 12.5 kilotons, and it killed 70,000 people. So these don't need to be giant things, but many of them became gigantic, the strategic ones. And that's why they tended to draw attention away from the little goofy battlefield nukes or tactical nukes. The biggest one was, of course, the Tsar Bomba, which was dialed down to 50 megatons. They had one that could have gone to 100, which is the ultimate 11. It was actually tested in the air over Nova Azemda and caused third degree burns, 100 kilometers away from ground zero. Wow. So that would wipe out. Basically, we have a lot of fans in New York. We wouldn't after the Tsar Bomba. The show would be suffering. Yeah, that way we would lose subscribers. And that's the main problem with these weapons. So can I tell a quick anecdote? Yeah. I knew a guy, wild guy, great guy. Now I can't remember his last name, but it is Sasha Bedokovic. Alexander Bedokovic. Alexander, son of Barricades. His father, Barricades, Buddy God was, you know, he had a classic Marxist name, was a, I want to say, he rose up to be general in the strategic nuclear forces equivalent in the Soviet Union. And he told me his dad loved to tell the story about how he was there for, I don't know, I can't remember if it was the Tsar Bomba. I want, it might have been that one, one of the detonations. And that the bomb went off and they were supposed to be down in their sort of bunkers viewing it. But he was so proud as a Soviet of the Soviet and workers achievement that when the blast wave came and they were far away, it wouldn't kill him, but he could feel the wind of it that he got up out of it and, and felt the whole thing like go right through him. Wow. And, yeah, and his brother who was born, you know, within a year or two after that was born with, uh, defects of some guy. I can't remember exactly. The, the other son, not the father. Another son, not Sasha, not Sasha, the one who was my friend, this is Sasha's father, but Sasha's brother. So another buddy got the bitch son of Barakade. Yeah, that was not patrioticism passing through your body. Oh, he said he didn't regret it at all. No. Oh, did they ask the son? I know exactly. I know. But anyway, yeah. Yeah. So that was 1961. The Soviet Union was always playing catch up with, uh, nuclear weapons with a lot of things really, always playing catch up to the US and, uh, 61, that would have been, uh, when the Soviet Union was relatively assertive. Maybe the only time it was assertive. Uh, the, the biggest US blast was again, and these are all strategic weapons. These have nothing to do with the so-called tactical nuclear weapons. The biggest US, uh, hydrogen mom tested was only 15 megatons versus 50. That is one five versus five zero. Uh, and I was tested in the Pacific. Uh, I think the martial islands. Mm-hmm. And something kind of went wrong there. It was two and a half times more powerful than it was predicted. That is, was supposed to be 15 megatons. It just was. Uh, and there were US troops, uh, who were whose job was to, to beginning pigs basically. And there were also, um, Pacific Islanders, people living in, uh, villages on the islands near there, uh, who were not evacuated until three days after the explosion. Now, I'm not saying everything the Soviet Union did was clean. God knows who got left. Oh, yeah. Nobody is there. Yeah. I don't think they cared much about that either. Yeah. But, um, the, in the Castle Bravo test, a lot of people, uh, suffered the crew of a Japanese fishing boat, 23 men got, uh, extreme radiation sickness. Because it was bigger than they thought. And it was, this was part of the nuclear aspect of the Cold War. It was like we, we, we love these things, but we're kind of scared of them at the same time. Yeah. Because, yeah. We don't quite know what they'll do. Well, I mean, yeah, they were going from theory to practice too. They, um, and they were not exactly sure. Well, so one was fission, one was fusion. Like, they weren't exactly sure how that chain reaction would be contained, you know, when, when they sit some of these off, so yeah, they, they had it theorized down pretty well. They were pretty close, but it could have gone really bad. Actually, that reminds me of a great Cold War story or, no, actually, that's a World War II story. When, when they were, uh, testing the bomb for the Manhattan project, the prototype of what was eventually dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, uh, Oppenheimer, the, the big American physicist was there. And he was quoted as having this really cool, uh, quote from, I think the Bhagavad Gita, one of the, yes, Indian, uh, Holy Texan was, I am become death destroyer of worlds. And, uh, his brother was with him at that site, not inside that. What he said was, well, I guess it works. Yeah, but no one would remember that, right? So it's a good way to rewrite that story. Yeah. Very death metal. Yeah. Before I forget it too, and then we'll move on, but, um, this quote by Stalin, it was kind of surprising to me. I guess because he felt implicitly threatened by 1946. And he had, in remarks, published in Provda, um, so a year after VJ day, uh, September 46, he said the atomic bomb is intended to frighten people with weak nerves, but it cannot decide the fate of war. Basically, he, he professed indifference, um, to the nuclear threat, which, which frankly is a, but I don't know, it's a smart, if you mean it, it's probably one of the smarter ways to deal, especially if you don't have nooks. Because isn't that how, how Mao reacted to Mao? Yeah. And I think Mao did mean it. Yes. One thing he wanted, population reduced, you know, one way or the other. I'm not, I'm not a sure if Stalin meant maybe it did, but, uh, yeah, Mao called nuclear weapons paper tigers. Yeah. Uh, I don't know. Well, first of all, if you attribute the surrender of Japan to the nuclear weapons, which is an arguable concept, then I don't think they were pretty good. I think they could have done with being a lot more weak-minded, you know, than they were. Uh, and it may, it may have made them surrender. Who knows? Yeah. Maybe the Soviet offensive did that as well. But, uh, yeah, I don't know. Russia had lost an awful lot of people. And yes, the idea of losing another double-digit million people in a nuclear war, God, I wouldn't be in the mood for a nuclear war in 1946. I think you understood that, um, that it was a different weapon in the sense that it gave the guy who held it a lot of leverage in the negotiation in the game. And the only way to take away that leverage is to say, uh, it doesn't bother me, you know, and, and then you've got to demonstrate that you mean it and you kind of have to mean it if you're going to gamble well, you know, you really have to be willing to take that risk. And if, you know, if you think it's worth it, then you do. So that doesn't mean, I mean, I don't think he was as blase as he professed. In fact, there are a lot of other quotes more in private where he was definitely not blase about it. Yeah. But, um, that was the position he took. And it's, it's not a stupid position to take. No, no, no. I, I just have the vague feeling that Mao mentored and he didn't. I don't know why I have that feeling. I can't prove it. Because Mao was a poet. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Song was pros all the way. Okay. So basically, um, in the mid 1950s for the US, uh, and by the, by 1961 for the Soviet Union, it's pretty clear that everybody can, everybody in, in those military industrial complexes can build a bomb that's too big to be safe for anybody, including the people who built it. You know, as a science fiction fan, I always wondered if there is any truth to the planet busting bomb theory. And as far as I know, no. Uh, but, uh, the, the Tsar bomb, if they dialed it up to a hundred, that might have had some interesting effects anyway. So people started looking for other ways. And the military in both the superpowers had been looking from the invention of nuclear weapons for ways to use them in battle. I mean, we ran into that in, uh, Korea, uh, or in the very early 1950s, when MacArthur wanted to use nuclear weapons as if they were some sort of artillery made by giants just to blast, uh, the enemy across the river. And the civilian leadership said, uh, no, no, we don't want them normalized in effect. And that was probably a reasonable decision because I've said this before, but I can't think of any other weapon, that kind of weapon that's been available known to be effective around for 75 years and hasn't been used. The, the taboo actually works. So this might, yeah, no predictions, but who knows? There hasn't been a nuclear weapon used for since 1945, which is remarkable. Uh, nothing like it in history. If anybody knows anything like it, we've got this weapon, we won't use it. Let me know. I mean, as you wrote once in your kind of proto-warnerd article of yours, um, I mean, a weapon that isn't used, can you call it a weapon? Yeah. I mean, the, uh, the 9-11 hijackers with the planes, you know, turned planes into weapons because they used them as weapons and they were weapons. Um, but the nukes unused, are they weapons? I guess there are coercive weapons unless you just say, well, I'm not going to be coerced. And that's the thing. I mean, Stalin said, I'm not going to be coerced. It's, you know, go ahead and try it. And in a sense is, well, the West's response, well, Ukraine and the West response to Putin's ambiguous threats, um, are kind of a bit more Stalin-like in a sense. It's sort of, they kind of go back and forth between, we're not going to give into those threats and, and they're not giving in as far as I can tell in terms of suddenly opening up negotiations. They're not, it's not changing any behavior as far as I can tell. Um, but then, but then they kind of leaked that, well, maybe, maybe we are getting close to Armageddon. Maybe we're at a 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis moment. Maybe we are. Maybe we aren't. It's kind of weird, but it's certainly, it's, it's not like when Kissinger and Nixon threatened Newkes and got immediate policy changes from the Soviets. It's, it's not having that effect. And it's sort of like, well, it's a weapon of bluff. It is a weapon of bluff and, and leverage. And, but you don't have any leverage if the other side refuses to acknowledge it. Then it's just either a weapon or not a weapon. Well, then I think it becomes, um, a last ditch weapon. Yes. A defensive weapon. Yes. I think there's, there's this general common place that nobody's going to invade the US because they've launched all the Newkes, which is almost certainly true. Yes. I think they might launch the Newkes in a lot of less desperate scenarios. Maybe Putin is expecting withdrawal and suggesting that if anybody follows withdrawing troops across the proper borders into Crimea or into Rostovov Blast or something, then, then these little Newkes come out. So, right. But, uh, or what's a big newkes? I don't know. So basically, a lot of effort starts to be devoted. And most of it is just because you can get funding for this. I mean, it's not like there's a deep logic behind these tactical and nuclear weapons. It's just that we can get money for them. We can design them. They're kind of fun to design. Let's, let's come up with some plans. And besides, in the 1950s, everything was supposed to be nuclear. We, people tried to design nuclear automobiles, uh, new, well, we got nuclear aircraft carriers, but, uh, everything was newke. So they started coming up with some really improbable weapons, which are just kind of fun to talk about in themselves. And, you know, some people might know of the Davy Crockett, uh, as one of the more improbable ones. Basically, it was a cheap mounted, recoilless rifle, something like a bazooka in common use, with a big forefend blobby nuke at the end of it, you know, in the way that an RPG has the cone-shaped warhead at the front. This had a big blobby, forefend nuke, which contained a W54 nuclear warhead with the yield of 20 kilotons. Remember, Hiroshima, 12.5 kilotons. This was considerably bigger than the Hiroshima bomb then. That's kind of weird because you're firing it from pretty close. I mean, this is, that's where it gets, that's where they should have done a gomer, I don't know. I was, I wasn't allowed to watch gomer pile, but I'm sure they should have done an episode on, on this because I gather gomer was in the hallowed of saying golly. Yes, you would definitely. Golly, sorry, should I fire the Davy Crockett? Pile, you get it there now! Yes, the stats are pretty scary. The range of the recoilless rifle was one and a quarter mile. The range of blast damage was a kilometer. So, you know, you need it to come a cosy infantry, and especially people who really believe we do miles damage, not kilometers. I'm imagining Pile trying to convert kilometers into miles while he's getting screamed at by the sergeant. Yep. Yeah. Oh god, yeah, it's a miles. 0.6 something. No, you didn't, no, I'm going to leave here because I have to go to dinner, but you fire that thing now. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, I know it's and they called it the atomic water melon too based on that shape. I think that was its nickname, right? The warhead itself. Yeah. Yeah. It was a good looking thing. Yeah, it is. Yeah, I did have a good look in the way a lot of 50s weapons had. But one of the interesting things about this and that I can speak to from sort of, I don't know, whatever my weird experience was, you needed kamikaze infantry for this. And contrary to, you know, the picture of the US, well, especially before the arrival of Trump slapped them in the face, contrary to those people's picture of the US, there were lots and there are lots of kamikaze infantry available. That's never been a problem. Guys who, you know, were ready to fire this thing. I mean, when the TOW Jeep mounted system was in practice, it was common knowledge that the expected casualty rate for the crews of the TOW was 84%. And they had no problem finding crews. So the, the crock it was meant to be like so many other weird ideas. It was meant for the folder gap. Like if, if you blast this thing into a Russian tank column coming through the folder gap, then you'll be able to deal with them pretty quickly. But the thing is, are you gonna break the new taboo for that, the Soviet position, made a little more sense. Like the, the new taboo won't hold in the event of a major European war. So everything flies at once. First we make sure to damage the American cities because they're used to being in vulnerable and they won't like it if they get vaporized. But in the meantime, we fire all our so-called tactical nukes as well. We fire all the little stuff. The NATO idea was we can tinker until we've built these little David Crocket style things. And we can use them and it won't make the Soviets too mad. Kind of a lame idea. It's funny that even in the imagined, the most sort of famous, at least in our lifetime, imagine Third World War. So the book, the Third World War. Which I've heard even sort of like pro-military or veteran types, you know, talk about, that book's pretty famous still, I think. You know, well known among, you know, vet nerds and stuff. But even in that book, US City doesn't get vaporized if I remember. It's Birmingham, I think that gets vaporized. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. As a demonstration in a way. But the US does, it's like nobody actually can really imagine. And I think that's, I think that's pretty deeply, nobody can really imagine American cities getting vaporized partially. That's well, yeah. That's particularly important with these tactical nukes because if you were in European Russia or Europe, what the hell was the difference? Whether you got your city vaporized by a tactical nuke or a strategic nuke. But if you were in Omaha, big, big difference because tactical nukes aren't going to be able to reach you. Only the ICBMs can go way up into space and then drop on you. So yeah, the whole tactical versus strategic distinction only made sense from the United States. And I mean geographically, the United States. And that kind of pissed a lot of people in Europe off at certain times. But there were all kinds of other stuff. Like the idea was we got these nukes. What else can we do with them? So some of the things they did with them, nuclear landmines, that is area denial munitions. What's the best way of making a valley that they might come through off limits? Nuket. The US, USSR both had plenty of these. You just make the landscape so hellish, so radioactive that nobody's going to enter it. Or better yet, detonate while they're coming through it. And then they vanish too. They could be set off by timer or by remote control. The full-degap was presumably full of these things. I don't know that anybody's ever released what was put in the full-degap. But the US had great plans to make that place uncrossable. Except the thing is it was a highly populated area of what was then less Germany. And I remember being an American in the Cold War, a very naive and gullible American thinking, what's those Germans problem? I mean, we're trying to protect them. I don't think that way anymore, folks. But I did that. And they lived in these areas. And there's wind in these areas. There's rain in these areas. They would have died in very large numbers. They would have been, oh, millions of Germans would have died. And Dutch and Belgium. So the way the US played, and the Soviet Union really played around with these short-range weapons, was oddly callous about their clients within Europe. And that goes for Eastern Europe for the Warsaw Pact as well. For example, you could take the warhead from the Davy Krocket, which was the W-54 warhead. Small, Newk, about 20 kilotons, without the rest of the weapons system, without the recoilless rifle or the Jeep or whatever. And you could put it in a backpack. And I swear to God, they made these backpacks in camouflage, which is a hilarious idea. No one will see it. Yes, it's invisible, like millhouse in the Simpsons. And yeah, you could pack it in. Yeah, good example of leave nothing but footprints, if not less. So the wildest version of this that I came across was the SADM, which was a bigger, more ambitious ADM area denial of munition. There was a two-man team. They'd parachute from a plane over an enemy harbor. They'd set this bomb because no one would notice them, of course. And they'd put a time on it. And then how do you know your army cares about you? Because the plan was they would swim out to sea to be picked up by a sub when the bomb went off. And so the sub is supposed to surface, you know, over an enemy harbor during wartime while or just before a nuke is about to go off there. And all I could think of reading about this was it depends on whether the sub commander wants to be a kamikaze too because if it was me, I would go deep and far. Oh, you meant that harbor because my plans here I'd like you with the one way over there. Oh, shit. I thought you meant Key West. Well, the real heroes and you know, they gave their lives for the country. Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's I've read the more I've been reading about nuclear stuff and nuclear thinking the more I think these people watch a lot of bad movies. Yeah, you know, yeah. And just internalize them way too deeply. It's kind of kind of scary. Well, they were sort of academics more than anything. And they didn't in a way they they dealt with the most consequential of all thinking. But at the same time, they they were very detached from it. I don't know. There were there were a lot of people who tried to argue about whether and how nukes could be used. Herman Khan got a bad rep for daring to talk about that. Like, you know, okay, there can be a nuclear war. It can be even one. But, you know, it'll be pretty ugly. And then there was Edward Teller who was a real hate object for a lot of people for someone better reasons. I mean, Teller seemed to enjoy it in a way that Khan didn't. But no matter how realistic they tried to be, yeah, there's something weirdly comic book about all these things. Something a Nibale once said in one of our episodes that informs that makes the American kind of ruling class a little bit different. The political ruling class is just that it does make a difference that America's never been invaded. It's just hard to imagine. And this informs everything from sort of the the piss poor COVID response to everything. It's just it's just not in the mentality. So it's not that real. It is actually it's only imagined through books and movies and you know, and then you can sort of manipulate in your mind a bit easier. It's hard to get. Well, one of the interesting literary tidbit on that is that very secure not to say smug cultures love to imagine their own demise, their own extinction. There are a ton. I mean, war of the world is not an outlier at all. Late pre-war Britain pre-1914 Britain love to imagine its own demise in a million different ways. And the US in its 20th century, a Germany was the same. Yeah, the romance lessons as you get closer to it. We will have our 1945 moment one of these days and we won't like it at all and we won't think it was school and things will change maybe if we're still around. But anyway, yeah, part of the fantasy thinking of the weapons designers is based on the fact that these are to be used in places we don't care about. For example, there were a nuclear surface to air or even air to air missiles. That is maybe we can't identify where the target is except in the very grossest way. So we'll blow up the whole sky. Or maybe we can't identify the enemy sub. So we'll nuke the ocean. And maybe there's a lot of tanks so we'll nuke Europe. It's still not our territory. And it was expendable. And the Europeans knew it. It's remarkable to me that they were so patient about it. I mean, isn't also a part of it. I remember this and remember my own stance back then when I was more of a right-wing waffin torpe of my own self. And the basic idea was that NATO, the US, could never field a conventional force like the Soviets could. And never would and never could. And so the only way to deterrence was nuke. And that therefore the only way we could even things out was first strike, first use nuke because we never renounce first use. But we would start with tactical thinking, then a whole theory, I think, developed around our gradualism. All their stupid game theory ideas of how this would really work out. It's basically convincing yourself that there is things can work out your way. And that the Russians, the Soviets would not, would respond, I guess, in tactical kind. So you would launch a few Davy crockets and they would fire back a few, I don't know, I mean, what would it be? Potemkin's? I don't know. And then you'd slowly sort of go up from there and then reasonable men would call a stop to the madness or something. Yeah, that's unlikely. But yeah, it's like, especially like the Soviet Union has somehow decided to put all its stake on a push westward because that's going to be do or die, either if they don't make it they're through. And then suddenly they're going to get a few little nukes, synching their toes and they'll stop and turn around. It's just not likely. But yeah, we keep talking about, and we can't avoid it. But we keep talking about little nukes, for example. You can see what a little nuk would do if you go to something called nukemap, NUKEMAP. It's a site by Alex Wallerstein. And he's done this amazing job. You can just input any location, well, maybe not any, but a lot of locations and then pick a weapon or a kilotonnage and you can see what it would do. It's kind of, I mean, the comic possibility, like the Nerdoid possibilities. Oh, yeah. I'm not saying I used to dial up Berkeley. I know. Exactly. I'd like to see this, but one for example, you know, during yields, yeah, here you go. I mean, Jesus. Yeah, lowest yield in the in the arsenal, the B61 mother. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. They're quite effective little things or not so little things. Probably the most quaves, I realistic idea of tactical nukes or battlefield nukes was artillery because, I mean, duh, you can send an artillery shell, protectile long way away before it goes off. The, there were famous early Cold War designs like the Honest John. They went for those homie names in the 50s, like, I don't know, Gomer Pyle firing and Honest John. Some of those shells became important later because they were the basis for the whole suitcase nukes, craze at the end of the Cold War. Spoiler alert, it's not entirely clear that there is literally a suitcase nuk anywhere that you can fit into an attache case, but you could probably wear a David Crockett warhead as a backpack if you were a pretty big person. It was Lebed who claimed Alexander Lebed, the big six foot six pumpkin headed general, Russian general, who was kind of a prototype for what Putin became actually. He's the one that said that Russia had produced, or the Soviets had produced, I don't know, 300 suitcase nukes and that 100 were missing. He said this back in like 97. I think he said it maybe shortly after he was fired by Yeltsin. But it's been very, very controversial since. I mean, that never came to pass. You remember what a big deal that was before? That was all anybody cared about around the millennium. Like what's going to happen to the Russian nukes, especially the little nukes, is some terrorist group going to get a hold of them. All kinds of mostly pretty cheap movies about that. I think I remember one called The Peace Maker with Cluny and Kidman. There were a lot of bad movies then. But if you remember the big panic was Russia is so unstable and nobody has any control over anything and everyone's poor. That was the big problem. Then Putin brought order to the country and then it was like Russia has too much order. Russia is a danger because it is now of single purpose trying to reconce... Well, then of course Putin did turn into a asshole. But that was the problem before. It was the chaos and now the problem is the command order. Well, yeah, I mean, I looked at one of the persistent hurts of the Russian elite. And it's a legitimate hurt over the last like 30 years is we did a lot for you guys. I mean, it could have gone a lot differently and a lot bloodier and a lot messier. Maybe a few people sold a few things but it's been 30 years and no nukes have blown up that somebody got from us. And, you know, no thanks to us. No, no, nothing. Yeah, it could have been so much worse. I mean, disposing of a whole giant nuclear arsenal, it's extraordinary. And by the way, a lot of those weapons were stored in Ukraine and they got out of Ukraine as far as I know, I mean, you tell me Mark, but as far as I know, there are no nuclear weapons in the Ukrainian arsenal. As far as I know, there aren't. They were the Bush administration, Bush senior leaned hard on the Ukrainian leadership to give up the nukes and then Clinton did as well. I mean, but we got I think it was Bush senior who got the agreement because as far as we were concerned, we just didn't want. I mean, there was there were indications even then that there was the relationship between Ukraine and Russia could be a problem and we just didn't want two states with nukes. Right. But that said, there was an article that came out. I guess it would have been leaked by US intelligence in the New York Times. I don't know, maybe 2017, 18, 19 at the peak of one of those when Trump maybe was going to go to a nuclear war, people were panicking about that with North Korea. There was investigation came out that the Ukrainians had sold the North Koreans ballistic missile technology because they do have ballistic missile technology there. Right. Parts of the whole space and missile programs were based in Ukraine. And so I was kind of wondering today before we started this show because that is a question, you know, how do we know the Ukrainians don't have nukes? There's a push now to give them the nukes. Yes. Yes. If they don't. So, Zelensky before the war as the Russians were massing forces, he had mentioned a couple times maybe we should get nukes because we should not be threatened like this. And Putin used that as one of the causes bellies like, well, we have to prevent this. That's one of I think the four reasons or goals of the invasion was to prevent Ukraine from developing that. I don't know how that's going since the war. I mean, I don't know what the hell they've done with that. But yeah, so I just kind of wondered, well, if this very sort of you know, dark deal was done, I think it was under Part of Shanko. Now he may not have known about it. But, you know, Ukraine is more, you say it's more under control now, but Ukraine was very factionalized and corrupt up until the invasion. So, Part of Shanko, who was president, then may have or may not have known about this deal to sell the North Koreans ballistic missile technology, ballistic missiles, which could presumably reach the United States. But I just wonder if the same people who did that deal may have gotten nuclear something in return from the North Koreans, because they're clearly good at building nukes now. And, and while I'll just one brief quote from a recent article, this was in Al Jazeera, but it doesn't really matter at this point, because they all interview the same people. This is from an interview with an Atlantic, our old friends at the Atlantic Council. This is from an interview with one of their shills. And he says, whatever restrictions we have on Ukraine forces, that is on giving them weapons. And I think we have some restrictions. I think we take all of those off. So, yeah, there's something new. Probably that doesn't extend to nukes at the moment. But I don't know, we'll see. So, okay, so there's this big explosion of sort of weird pre-Cambrian evolution in the 1950s with little handheld and other nukes. It's amazing they didn't come up with a nuclear hand grenade. That would have been hard. I know. And also the Starship Troopers, I mean, it just screams right now, right? When I think of a much better Davey Crockett when he fires up on a nuclear grenade. Yeah. Oh, yeah, right into the big bug. Legs everywhere. This was sort of calming down a bit when Reagan came in. But anyway, nuclear artillery, early Cold War, the honest John. But what could be classed as nuclear artillery was the Pershing 2, which was installed in Europe from 1983 to 1991. But the Pershing 2 was quite a big old deal. It was 35 feet 10.6 meters long. And it carried could carry the W85 warhead, which could carry a nuclear payload of up to 80 kilotons, which is, I can't do the math, but about seven times the power of Hiroshima. This was supposedly meant to counter the SS-20, a mobile nuclear weapon mid-range deployed by the Soviet Union. But there was a strange asymmetry about the whole SS-20 versus Pershing 2 faceoff, which was no matter what happened with it, Europe was going to be a glowing wasteland. But although Russia, or at least most of the inhabited part of Russia, would suffer the same kind of damage, maybe the United States wouldn't suffer anything because these weapons didn't have the range, which was why they were considered tactical nuclear weapons. And that caused a lot of problems. I don't know if you were too young to remember Mark. Oh, I remember this. All the huge protests. I think it was the largest anti-nuclear protest in history of the Cold War in Germany, in Holland, in Britain, I think as well. Oh, yeah, in Britain, it became, there was this sit-in that lasted 20 years at an RAF base, which was going to hold some not-pushing tube at cruise missiles. Greenham Common. There was a women's protest there that became the basis of a lot of right-wing jokes, but was actually pretty determined protest. I should add here that the person, I mean, Reagan came in saying we want to put the person's twos in. There was a massive protest and opposition in Europe. And what finally broke European public opinion in favor or allowing them to be able to put the the person's twos in was, we did an episode on this episode 110 on disinformation warfare, was the the downing of the Korean Airlines 007 by the Soviets and the way the US they did down it, but the way the US manipulated the downing and because we had tapes that we had intercepts of the tapes between the Soviet fighter that shot down this passenger plane that had strayed over Soviet military airspace. And we manipulated the tapes and played it at the UN that gave the impression that the Russians, the Soviets knew it was a civilian and didn't care and they were so cold-blooded and had, as we always said, communists have no, they don't value human life the way we do and the usual stuff. And it was so successful, I mean, the people who were deeply involved in American disinformation at that time and later talked about it. Said it was by far the most effective disinformation program or operation, I guess, like in history and it completely changed on a dime, public opinion and shortly afterwards the person twos were accepted in West Germany and elsewhere. Yeah, it really was extraordinary. Like for Western Europe to accept again being a battlefield, a killing field really because it wasn't going to be any battle. It was just going to be a lot of dying. For the third time in a few people's lives, people who were alive at the time, it's extraordinary and it shows the effectiveness of Anglo propaganda really. So Reagan's administration was a lot of people who weren't very bright individually but somehow were good at PR. Well, a lot of them came from that. A lot of his brain trust were car dealers from SoCal. Car dealers in nursing home magnets and stuff like that. Just the sleaze of capitalism. And they were good at selling. So they sold this and there's a quote that sort of shows exactly how missiles like this pretty damn big, pretty damn powerful. We're intended to blur the whole strategic versus tactical divide. Quote, crews and perishing missiles serve precisely that function because they will couple the tactical nuclear forces in Europe with the strategic nuclear forces. So the US now had a lot of perishings. A lot of nuclear weapons aimed at presumably Russian troop concentrations in cities. But from what was then West Germany, which was very heavily populated, tiny strip of land, it would have been a write-off in the event of a real war. Those weapons were eliminated in a 1991 treaty and we can't even get into the history of the treaties. Most of them, it doesn't matter very much. But they were taken out of service at the same time. The SS 20 and the Persian 2 taken out, although the the warhead from the Persian 2 was well the B61 warhead, the most common nuclear warhead in the American arsenal, had been implanted on some Persian 2s and they took them out and put them on another weapon system. The B61 by the way, 400 kiloton yield, pretty big bomb. The last big noise for US tactical nuclear weapons was probably, well to the moment, was Rumsfeld's obsession with bunker busters. And that involved one version of the B61, the basic warhead in the American nuclear arsenal. A modification called the MOD 11. Rumsfeld wanted a nuclear bunker buster because he was imagining war with someone like Saddam who in his idiotic view of Iraqi society was the sort of brain bug and once you killed the brain bug everything would be fine. And the brain bug would go to ground in its secret underground layer. So you developed this modification of the B61 warhead that could penetrate the earth and then send its explosive force downward. So there were tons of different versions of the B61 and one of them, this MOD 11 thing was a hardened penetration bomb. You remember Mark from the the second Gulf War, lots of talk about penetration bombs. Oh yeah, I have a article here. Here's one article. I went back to because in all this talk I was surprised. It seems that no one really remembers how openly the Bush administration was talking about using tactical nukes. It was big talk. Serious chin scrubbers would talk about whether we should do it or not because no one imagined, no one ever imagined there'd be consequences back then. It was thought end of history. This is how it's going to always be America's as sole hegemon. Anyway, here's a headline. Rumsfeld won't rule out nuclear bomb against Iraq. February 14, 2003, Defense Secretary Don Rumsfeld today refused to rule out the US use of nuclear weapons in a possible war with Iraq while a leading senator told them such a move would trigger quote, a near total breakdown on quote in American relations with the rest of the world. You know, our policy historically has been generally that we will not foreclose the possible use of nuclear weapons if attacked. Remember that hell, that even means. But really what he was talking about was nuclear. I remember he was looking into an ordered reviews to look into making nuclear bunker busters tactical nukes because the Senate, I think, had passed with Clinton a ban on testing or production or research or anything with tactical nukes in like 1994 and Bush resented it. Bush resented that in 2003 with the Senate approval, if I remember right, too. But there were some real articles that came out about how they were planning to use small nukes. This happened again in 2007 or six or seven, Seymour Hirsch reported when they were starting to when they thought, well, Iraq is going so great. Let's get it on in Iran. And they were talking about using nukes to penetrate sort of hardened shell hardened underground nuclear research facilities in Iran and seriously considering it at that time. Well, yeah. And these things still exist. As far as anyone knows, there's about 50 of the model 11 version of the B61 with its 400 kiloton yield. And they're designed to be carried in inevitably the stealth bomber, the B52 spirit. I mean, really name it after a cheap airline. That's a good idea. So right next to the Ryan air, that would be a much better name. Oh, wow, let's not use that. Got to pay $10 for peanuts. All right. But now, wait, before we go on, I forgot another article. I even forgot how crazy this was. And I remember that time being extremely crazy. But here's another article. This 2002 New York lost Angela's Times. The headline is US works up plan for using nuclear arms. I mean, it's the thing like right now, I think everybody thinks no one could even contemplate this, especially since the end of the cold war. What Putin said, I'm not bluffing. You know, this is unprecedented. But here's the article. The Bush administration has directed the military to prepare contingency plans to use nuclear weapons against at least seven countries. There's like Scarface level. And to build smaller nuclear weapons for use in certain battlefield situations, according to a classified document report obtained by the LA Times. I don't know. The secret report says the Pentagon needs to be prepared to use nuclear weapons against China, Russia, Iraq, North Korea, Iran, Libya, and Syria. It says the weapons could be used in three types of situations against targets able to withstand non-nuclear attack in retaliation of our attack with nuclear, which is obvious, or in the event of surprising military developments. That's a pretty broad range. I mean, oh yeah. Yeah, I said, I mean from from Russia and China to I guess you should also leave me off the list now. They took care of that without having to use nukes and one of brilliant job they did on that. Yeah, it's basically every country we don't like. We got a nuclear plan. And we end like if they can if they have targets they can withstand non-nuclear attack. So that's a pretty low threshold. It's like well, we couldn't use something else. So we had to bring it to do. It's not our fault. They shouldn't have built that thing, you know. And the event of surprising. Yeah, nobody nobody is supposed to be safe from the American military. It's a it's a strange notion. So yeah, well, I mean, I don't know, as an old drugie, I always and someone who grew up in the in after well during and after the Vietnam war, I always thought well, of course there are only rules until people get excited and then there are no rules. That was always the rule about drugs. They used to talk about the drugs exception to the Bill of Rights and nobody minded. So, you know, well, yeah, that's good. That means us to Russia because people say, oh, Russian doctrine only says this or that. And like in a sense, that doesn't matter. I mean, whatever Russian doctrine supposedly says, the use of it's going to be decided for whatever political or personal or military whatever freaking reasons at, you know, that arise in warfare if they're used. It's kind of doesn't matter what the rules are. And then we're depending on our understanding of Russian doctrine when they probably haven't figured it out themselves. And I mean, jeez, but anyway, first of all, Russia supposedly has, this is what you will hear to the extent it means anything. Russia does have 2000, supposedly, 2000 warheads on tactical nuclear weapons. Nobody knows if that's really accurate. And the ironic bit is that Russia in 1991, when it was probably at its lowest point, quite ready to grovel to the US, offered to get rid of them with a treaty. And at that point, the US military put its foot down and said because such a tree wouldn't have involved taking nuclear weapons off Navy ships and submarines like no way. To be fair, I'm sorry, but to be fair to the US military people. Gorbachev's negotiating strategy was how about you and I both do this. We say no. And they say, okay, I'll do it unilaterally then over and over. And so it's sort of like, well, he'll probably do this if we say no anyway, you know, with Yeltsin, it was. Yeah, you could bet on that. Things changed after that. Russia got a little less prone in its dealings with the US and also started to realize that in a military plane field that was where it was actually disadvantaged in almost every way for all the talk about Russian hoards and stuff. Tactical nuclear weapons were one of the few advantages they had or one of the few tradable assets they had and they wanted to keep them until they could at least trade them for something. So officially 2000 warheads, what are they and what are they mounted on? This is where most reporting gets extremely vague about this. And I don't quite know why because of Russian secrecy. I doubt that very much. In 1991, you could buy anything in Russia and well, any information anyway. So I imagine the people who know about things in DC and London know exactly what the warheads are and what they're on. The most likely estimate I've heard is that if Russia used a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, the warheads would be probably 10 kilotons that is a bit smaller than the Hiroshima bomb, but still quite a quite a big deal. That is a big deal. It's weird that that's tactical, but yeah. Once again, tactical doesn't really mean anything. So, you know, how would they be delivered? That again is not very clear, but most likely by a short-term short-range missile launcher or mid-range missile launcher. You could start with the old touch-cust system, mobile launcher, normally conventional can carry nuclear explosives. The warhead can be up to 100 kilotons, which is higher officially than the tactical nuclear weapon used to allow for. But again, these things don't mean anything. Both sides have been using numerous touch-custins war. Yeah. Even in the second-church war, I'd love to know what they were used for in the second-church war, but apparently they were used. Ukraine has used them. Yep, against February 22 against the Russian airfield in Rustov. And they might have been used against separatists in Donetsk, separatist barracks, and Russian ship in July 22. When you hear about Ukraine maybe using a scary weapon, it's soft-pedaled for obvious reasons. You don't hear much about it. The follow-up system to the touch-ca is the Iskander system, named after Alexander. I hate to think what touch-ca was named after, but we won't go into that. And capable of delivering tactical nukes as well as standard explosive warheads, conventional warheads. And by the way, these things all fire conventional warheads, but most of the time that's not what they were designed for. And if anybody cared about budgeting in the big war establishments, hours or theirs, they'd be screaming at the idea of a missile like this being used to deliver a little conventional weapon. They're so expensive and they're so fancy that it's just not what they were meant to do. Right. And these cruise missiles, like especially now that Russia's been essentially cut off from a lot of high-tech, or it's going to be really hard to get the high-tech that they want to get. I would think these missiles are even more valuable to them because it's going to be hard to produce new ones. Yeah. There are Iskander missile systems in Ukraine. They can fire nuclear weapons, but they haven't so far. And that's where things stand. I mean, the real issue would be, what would you gain if you were putting from that? It's possible you would tear the NATO alliance, which has been incredibly lockstep and effective so far, that you would rip that apart. But I don't think so. That was one of his initial calculations, Putin, was that there's no way when he wanted to flip the table as our, guess Brian trained, I would call it, that there was no way Germany, German business elites, let alone political elites, would be willing to sort of commit economic suicide on behalf of Ukraine. And that turned out to be a wrong assumption, a really bad assumption. Putin kind of understood that on the economic side, at least, that he had something kind of like mad capabilities that mutually assured destruction capabilities that the West might be able to knock down Russia, a generation, but Russia with its energy could knock Germany and therefore, you know, rich Europe down a major notch. And the way where they risk that, and it was wrong. Yes. So, it had a lot of bad calculating calculations on, especially on Putin's part in this war. Yeah. I shouldn't predict anything. I know. At least if there were a successful or partly successful attempt to retake Crimea, maybe they'd come out then. They might. But what's been talked about is sort of tactical nukes used as strategic nukes, you know, again, use these, these are such kind of ridiculous differences. A demonstrative explosion. They're saying like maybe he'll launch a sort of demonstrative explosion over a demonstration explosion over the Black Sea somewhere, over Snake Island. That would maybe kill a few Ukrainian, I don't know if Ukraine has any but in Snake Island now, to show that he means it and that he's not bluffing. Because it is kind of a problem. If this is a weapon whose a lot of its value is as a as leverage to coerce your enemy and no one's being coerced, then it has zero value, actually zero value, unless you use it. So then then the only use is actual military kinetic use, right? I mean, right? And then or maybe kinetic use in order to build up that leverage, you know. But then the thinking is I've heard I've heard this explain. It was kind of scary I have to say. I was listening to a New York Times science reporter, William Broad, right? I think he's their main science reporter. I was listening to him talk about this old tactical nukes and will put into it. Being a New York Times guy, it means he's very well connected with the sources and power and they tell him they're thinking when they wanted out there, right? I mean, it's a lot of these access journalists are about. And the scenario that they foresee is that Putin might set off a tactical nuke to demonstrate he's serious and that if he does that, and this is the thing, this is like, this is how they've gained it out. If he does that, what he will find is that he will lose every friend he had in the world that suddenly China will say, you've crossed the line, you've broken it to boo. And you know, the administration may believe that they've had those sort of assurances. That doesn't mean they've actually had those assurances. They may have heard them because they want to hear it. But he loses India, he loses China, he loses South Africa, basically everybody except I don't know North Korea and Assad says, you've crossed the line and we've turned our backs to you. And at that point with no friends, Putin realizes his whole war effort is collapsing in front of him. And then I don't know, dark brand in walks in the room and takes off his sunglasses and sends it to the hog or something. I mean, like the thinking it's really, it was creepy to me because it's so Michael Bay movie, end of Michael Bay movie. Fantastic. If everything happens in the right way, in the right order. Yeah. I mean, here's a scenario and it's not a good scenario at all. Putin sets off a demonstration nuke and other countries that are to one degree or another backing him or not turning back on him and trading with whatever. They are freaked out. They're bothered by it, but they don't cut off relations. And that it does actually nothing at all. Yeah. I mean, to me, that's the most likely thing that happens. I don't know that he sets off a non-demonstration nuke at a purely military target. Yes. A large Ukrainian base. And that would be a different PR calculation. Yes. That would seem to me to be more likely because why would you break the taboo and get nothing military? I don't know. It seems pretty stupid to me. I mean, you're still basically showing you're afraid to use them. So if you're going to prove you're not bluffing, you've got to use it. And he does that. And nothing happens except the US and NATO massively ups military support. One, I don't know, we give them planes now or I'm not sure what else we can. Missles that can reach into Russia. We station US nuke in Ukraine in a purely symbolic way because we're not going to send them over the border. It doesn't even necessarily do anything. It seems to me a very possible scenario. I mean, it's possible. Everyone turns their back on and it's really like the end of the movie. And in all the ashes, he sits there and says, my empire's crumbling. And why? Why? And then dark Brandon comes in again. It takes off his sunglasses. Send him to the hog where you can think about this for the rest of his short life. I don't know what the fuck these guys are thinking. I tried this. It's like you said, it's actually hard to find any real meat on the tactical nuclear story anywhere. It's kind of strange. Then I went around to different podcasts and it was also kind of a wasteland. And I found this one. So it was some podcast with again, named Dr. Peter Pry. And he is like a made man in the US sort of national security state apparatus, director of the United States nuclear strategy forum, congressional advisory board. He was like a top CI analyst on Soviet and Russian nuclear capabilities and so on and so on. I mean, he's got he's got all the credentials. And I listened to him talking. And the first 20 minutes were him saying, the Russians don't think like us. We have different values. And Americans are very optimistic. I mean, it was like every frickin' cliche in the book, whereas Russians, you know, that leadership are paranoid. They don't think like us. Basically, their barbarians were civilized. And saying like, we have to get into their minds. It's very hard for us because we're also good decent people who would never do anything bad. And he's implying like he's gone, he's gone to the dark side. You know, he's gone in that place where Luke Skywalker went into. It was a genetic disease. And it finally got him. Yeah, I know. You went in with this calpers and measured Putin's head. And you know, I mean, and this is a top guy. I mean, yeah, I would think if you were really going to be a critical thinker here, if nothing else deciding to invade Ukraine with that army proves that Russians can be optimists. That's a great point. It is a great point. But, you know, this thinking, I think, in that pampered boardroom, highly credentialed Ivy League, Georgetown world of foreign policy and national security state elites, like I'm just thinking of Kissinger now. And we need to show the Soviets that the Chinese, they'll be, they'll respect us more if we threaten the nuclear world. And the Chinese are like, what the hell is wrong with these guys? This is horrible. Kissinger muttering through his blubbery lips every racist cliche you can think of about Indians. Yes. Yes. And I think sort of like what might Putin do? What would Putin do? You might do something stupid. I don't know. Okay, I'm going to predict, as we said. I would think that there is a there is a real chance according to doctrine and everything. If they try to retake Crimea and Russian proper of something nuclear. But my my fear is the mentality in DC. And this actually there, they're and it's just like endemic going back decades. They're completely inability to grasp other peoples in the world and thinking we have to do X to show them why to get behavior Z when that's not at all what was needed ever. You know, and then. Well, you know, that may be related to to the tactical aspect of the tactical nuclear weapons debate. Like maybe that will actually mean something in that maybe DC is so obsessed with these tactical nuclear weapons because they can't reach the continental US. Whatever happens with them, you know, a few millions or tens of millions of Europeans might die. But that's never really bothered those people very much. Yeah. I think we can end it on that note, right? Yep. Absolutely. Perfect note. All right, that was our episode on tactical nuclear weapons, which we all may get to become a little more familiar with in the coming months. All right. Thanks again, John. Thank you, Brandon. Thank you again, everyone. Thanks everybody. Bye. you",
