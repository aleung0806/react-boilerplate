    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. The day today is August 29th, 2022. And this is episode 344, but John, I think we can say this is seven years. Wow. Seven years of Radio Warner. Anyway, I'm the coast, Mark Ames. I'm currently in Los Angeles, California. And of course, I'm on the line with the A.K.A.'s, himself John Dolan, a.K. Gary Brecher, a.K.A. the Warner in Tropeja, John. How you doing? Yeah, I'm, you know, dealing with Tropeja. We're back at a hotel. We've had to go to a hotel every time we want to do a show because there's still no internet. And Catherine was supposed to go to the Questura, which is basically the police to get our six months permission to be here, which would enable us to get real Wi-Fi. And apparently the application we, we mailed to them, never got there. So we have, we have an update for another appointment, but basically they said, ah, wait till you get to Trieste. And, you know, maybe I'm just being a negative, not only here, but I kind of think they're kicking it down the street to Trieste. Yeah. Kicking the can up the peninsula to Trieste. Wow. Sorry to hear that. Yeah, I mean, it's, yeah, it's summer. When you need a visa, when you need to deal with any of that, you're out of luck, you know, just, yeah. And countering people whose job is to say no. Yeah. And especially in the summer and the heat and all that stuff. Yeah, it's like double no. All right. Well, just real quickly, you're in Trieste. What at the end in beginning of September or end of September, end of September, end of September. Okay. I've had a couple of people say, oh, I hear John's going to be up in Trieste. Like, I think some of the folks from the Empire never ended podcast. The, you know, that we did this, Serbian, Roman, I think somebody's near there that wanted to get in touch with you. So I should be. Yeah. That's what we got to get a car when we go there. Right. So seventh anniversary, lucky number seven. So hopefully this year's going to be a good year for everybody. Looting us. Anyway, we have with us popular radio Warner guest, armor. He did the Arab conquest series with us, very popular Arab conquest series. That was episode 246, 249, 251, 255 about the early Islamic Arab conquests. And then we did another infamous show, episode 279, in glorious, Katari Buster, it's about the Katari Buster with armor. That was fun. And we did also a show about his other homeland Bahrain. That was episode 268. And today, thanks to armor suggestion, we're going to do something that's one of those, oh, yeah, that's obvious. Of course we should do it, which is Saddam Hussein, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. We talk much more about the Gulf War. That is the American version. We're going to actually talk about the Iraq invasion of Kuwait, which armor has some intimate knowledge of. First of all, armor, welcome back to the show. Thank you for having me, guys. I appreciate that. No, no. I mean, good job, your point on my episode with Bahrain, really putting the first astragity and now as far as my background. Because this story about Saddam's invasion of Kuwait was, there's so many moving parts in all of them are so stupid in so many ways. Yes. We were talking about how we start this off. And we sort of agreed that first of all, probably because so little is really remembered about the actual, you know, the Iraqi invasion and occupation compared to, you know, the big giant Gulf War and George Bush and Norman Schwartz, coffin, all that stuff. So I think what we want to do is start off briefly with the Iraqi invasion occupation. And then we're going to go back, right? And sort of trace how this war, how the invasion and occupation became, I don't know, the logic to it eventually became almost inevitable. It's our life cinematic way of doing things. We're going to start in media race or in media invasion and then go back to how it happened. Right. It's like starting off the Spielberg movie with the invasion of Normandy beaches and then you kind of slowed down and okay, maybe not. Anyway, so, Um, Um, Um, Um, how do we want to start this off? Well, I mean, I can tell you how, uh, my mom heard about the invasion or found out that that Kuwait was being invaded. She wasn't Kuwait at the time. Was your whole family in, in Kuwait at the time or maternal? Yeah. Well, not all of them. So I'm going to get to that because, um, the Iraqis invaded on August 2nd in the early eight AM, um, two eight, they crossed the border at about one, um, one or two AM, four brigades, uh, two mechan, two armored one mechanized and one motorized. Um, uh, interestingly enough, they sent the, the Republican guard, not the regular army. Um, and I'm going to get to that as well. But anyways, my mom had woken up at five AM to pray, the dawn prayer and right after she finished, uh, my, her sister and lost all my uncle's wife. Because so just to go back a bit, they all live in one big house. Um, it's kind of, uh, I don't know how to describe it, but, and it's not popular anymore, but back in that generation, like multiple kids of, of the parents would live in the same house. So my mom, her siblings and then grandma and grandpa lived in the same really big villa, like multiple, uh, sweets and so on. Um, right. So her sister and law barges in at five AM and tells her the Iraqis have arrived. Uh, they've invaded. Uh, she had found out from a family member who had called her and my mom said that she remembers, uh, running up the stairs to her elder sister who was there and telling her and she was just in pure shock. Like no, they had no idea this was going to happen as far as the regular Kuwaitis went. Um, so my mom, my mom says, that, uh, like an hour after that, they started hearing the planes, um, like, uh, Iraqi planes on, um, at low, low, uh, altitude. Um, and as far as, uh, her first thought was, um, like, worst screw because, uh, the, the, so this was August 2nd in the AM, which was summer, which John can testify can get to ridiculously hot in Kuwait. Yeah. Um, um, it was the day, the beginning of the Islamic New Year. So a lot of the police and soldiers were off on, on a stat holiday, like it was under, everywhere was understaffed. Uh, there was no preparation for the invasion. Like there was nothing. She has, um, six sisters and four brothers, um, and mom and dad, her mom, two of her brothers and three of her sisters were away in Egypt at the time because this was like the peak of the tourism season. Um, and Kuwaitis at the time, like if you're a middle class cosmopolitan Kuwaiti, they loved going to Egypt for the summer, every summer. That was like their, their long island or whatever. Um, so half the family was away, which left my mom, her elder sister and her dad as the sort of three elder people in the, in the broader household that would run, run the house for the next six months. Um, and she said that, um, it took about a day for the entire invasion to be complete. Like there was this, there were done. There was no, um, uh, really, there was no battle really. There was two battles that could become strut as battles, but it wasn't like, there was no border of resistance or front really. There was no front. Did Kuwaiti people, did your family, for example, expect the Kuwaiti armed forces to do anything or did they accept that if the Iraqi army wants to come in, they're coming in. They accepted that because I talked to someone in the Kuwaiti military and officer who described that first of all, besides being understaffed because of the tourism season plus the Islamic New Year, um, the Kuwaiti army was like, they had, they had good air force and good armor in terms of chiefs and tanks and Mirage F1s, but the numbers, the numbers just weren't there. Like the entire Kuwaiti army at the time was about, um, 18, 20,000 that includes the army, the air force and the navy, all of it was 20,000 people. The Iraqi army that, the, not even the Iraqi army, but like the four divisions that attacked the two armored one mechanized and one motored or 88,000. Wow. Yeah. So that's a four to one, uh, favorable ratio for Iraq without including the regular army, which was coming as like, you know, um, behind them. And, uh, the Iraqis also launched preliminary, um, sort of Israeli style attacks on the Kuwaiti air bases as the invasion was happening. So um, the Iraqi air force mostly Sukhoi's and, uh, mix, um, carpet bomb, the two major Kuwaiti air bases put them out of action. Um, actually, my, uh, talked to another person who, who was a pilot who said that they, they, they managed to get away about 70% of their airplanes, like, like, flee with them, like make sure they weren't falling into Iraqi hands, but they had to use the highways to, to fly because the, the runways were completely destroyed. Um, but as far as like resistance was concerned, I think, I think a lot of the people I talked to echoed that first of all, in terms of numbers, they were overwhelmed. In terms of armor, vehicles, aircraft, they were overwhelmed. And the Iran, Iraq war was very fresh and people's memories and they were, there was a sort of understanding or not understanding per se, but a recognition may be that they did not want Kuwait to be another Hora Mshar, which became like, you know, the site of a hellish battle in the Iran-Araq war. So yeah, it was easier to surrender. There were some pockets of resistance in particular, um, Desmond Palace, which was the royal residence of the Emir, the Emir was jobber at the time. He had fled with his retinue and family to Saudiia, um, which I will get to later because that there was like some alarm bells over how early he knew about the invasion, but his half-brother, Prince Fahad, had led a detachment of, uh, royal guards, um, in a sort of resistance in that palace that lasted like several hours, but eventually Iraqi APCs basically blasted all of them. And, uh, yeah, Fahad comes across as, uh, a brave guy. Yeah. He didn't take the easy option of flying out. I mean, I remember once being told by a senior academic that I was, I was so proud of, you know, constantly 11th and dying on the walls and all that. And he said, yeah, well, Constantinople didn't have an, uh, an airport. And, you know, but so Kuwait did that, Kuwait did have an airport and Fahad still chose, I guess, to, uh, fight it out, but he was, he was an athlete, right? He was, uh, he was a, it was a macho kind of guy. He was a jock. Yeah. He was a jock. Like, he was the ideal person to like put them at palace to like, delete, for delaying tactics because jocks like him. And like, I respect the fact that he resisted and died and there just had to you, uh, near Desmond Palace now that's basically a fist with blood, uh, pouring down, um, the wrist of that fist, which was, um, sort of like a symbol to Fahad's, a sacrifice along with, uh, like several dozen, uh, troops, um, so we're with him, mostly national guard and royal guard. Um, but I mean, what, what I found interesting is that it wasn't like he was buying time for the emir to flee. The emir had already fled. Like Fahad could have fled with the emir, but he chose to die, I guess, standing in the palace, which fair enough, my respect. Um, and the other aspect of that was the Iraqis. So the palace is on the sea. It's on the Kuwait Bay. So the Iraqis, while they were attacking with the APC's from one front, they sent a detachment of naval commando officers from the sea to outflank them. And you know, they were all doomed. Like there was not going to be, yeah, zero chance. I mean, yeah. Yeah. So it's pretty, it's impressive. I mean, I wouldn't have thought anybody would have fought for the royal family with, were they fighting for the royal family or honor or the nation? I mean, how much of a sense of nationhood? I guess we'll get into all this, but, uh, we can get into that. But I mean, it wasn't so much nationhood as a sort of purely nationalist concept, but I mean, it's the same. So I mean, the, the, the, the, the farcical nature of this war is that Saddam continued to make the same mistakes he did with the Iran-Iraq war, just repeating over and over, like slipping on a banana peel. Like when he invaded Iran, he had expected the, uh, Arab population of Huzistan to join him in a sort of like Arab, Arab brotherhood against Persian speakers, but they didn't. They resisted because if one thing can unite the people against and outside force, it's an invasion. Like, that's how you, like, that's a really good way of building. Greed with flowers, I believe, is how the Neocons called it with the Iraq invasion. Yeah. Yeah. The only flowers they got were flowers attached to IEDs on the side of roads in Falujah. Right. Yeah. I mean, it's the same thing here, like, maybe there was not a lot of nationalist identity before the invasion, but like, Kuwaitis now, like, all the Kuwaitis I spoke to are extremely nationalistic in the sense that that invasion forged a Kuwaiti sense of people. Yes. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. I think we're seeing versions of that in Ukraine. Like, Ukraine was a kind of a mess, um, and its nationhood is being forged by the Russian invasion a lot, but, um, certainly at least in the middle and west of the country. Were many Iraqis killed at all on this, do we know? Or a few hundred, at least. A few hundred, wow. Yeah. Um, so, yeah, it's somewhere between a 200 to 300 killed and wounded total, less 200 to 300. As opposed to the Kuwaiti casualties were, um, I think I've heard somewhere between 400 and 450 killed and about 12,000 captured. Yeah, they did use the Chieftain tanks, at least for a while, in the Battle of the Bridges, right? And they worked. They were blasting away at Iraqi armor and killed a fair bit of it, but it didn't matter. Which is exactly what the Iranians did, by the way, the Kuwaitis did exactly the Iranians that which is, use the Chieftain tanks as stationary artillery. Wow. And, uh, basically just, because the Battle of the Bridges, so it's called the Bridges, but these Bridges were, um, I don't know how to describe them. I mean, John, you're, you're in Kuwait. Do you, do you recall like a big Kuwaiti highways, the ones that are four lanes as high? Absolutely. And I recall that landscape once you get out of the city because, you know, Kuwait is basically a big city with very, very flat mud, dried mud planes around it. Yeah. And, uh, you don't have much reason to go out of the city, but I remember we had to go to some smaller airport that takes you to Dubai or something and that, that airport was way out there on the mud planes. And the only way I can imagine a bridge in territory like that is like an overpass over a, uh, wadi or something. This one was an overpass, over an underpass, that kind of sense. Right. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that was the bridge and the battle of the bridges. But, um, and there were multiple points where that was like an overpass over an underpass and multiple points where, um, the Kuwaiti troops fought delaying tactics using the bridge as a choke point, um, and, uh, using the chieftains as artillery in those choke points. But I mean, it was, it was bound to fail, especially with the, um, 20% of their air, air, power done and the other 80% going to Saudi Arabia. There was like air superiority was entirely Iraqi and the mechs and the Sukhois had a field day with, with destroying their armor and then the, the Republican guard just came in and mopped up. But they did, I mean, there, these different like pockets of resistance, um, held up, uh, for several hours. Like, it, it didn't take until August, the late August 3rd for, um, the all of Kuwait to be occupied without resistance, like for the resistance to be crushed entirely, which like for a country like Kuwait, as small as it is and as limited in its geography in terms of resistance as it is, it's quite impressive in my opinion. Just to set up the scene here, um, Kuwait in 99 ages looked this up. The total population was two million and I would guess that at least half of that was foreign, um, one more, okay. Two five million of that was foreign, only seven hundred and fifty thousand were Kuwaiti. Right. Okay. And, um, it is about 17,000 square mods about the same size for at least for American audiences here about the same sizes as the state of Connecticut, maybe slightly larger. And it is, um, at the mouth of, of the Persian Gulf, right? I mean, it's, and it borders both Saudi Arabia and Iraq and is very close across the waterway from Iran. Okay. So I, now that the setting is basically just set again, let's go back to where we were. So, um, Kuwait is basically fully occupied, takes a couple days, a day, a day or two for Iraqis to completely subjugate Kuwait. And now let's talk a little bit about the occupation. I thought we'd start armor with your family if they told you anything about this because I'm trying to imagine their house and I've seen houses like that and I imagine there's a wall around it, right? So you, um, yes, you just try to stay inside. Yeah, my mom said that she only left the house during the entire six months occupation once. Um, and she described it as, and I put this as quotes because I thought it was very poignant. Um, the one time I left the house, um, the entire like air and land felt depressing, like everything felt sad. And like the country and the soil felt, um, a sense of grief. And there was just no reason to go out anymore. Like we just need in. You went out only for, um, emergencies or urgent, um, uh, business. Uh, and, uh, yeah, I think you can imagine the house, John, big house wall, um, a sizable yard. Um, and the Iraqis search the twice, um, once because, um, our neighbors, at the time was a high ranking officer in the ministry of interior. And, uh, he had fled into hiding and had, uh, returned back home once. And the Iraqis, I guess, had gotten wind of that and barged into his house. And he had jumped the fence over to our house. So, and they saw him. Oh, so they barged in our house. Right. Yeah. I mean, we were just biting our own business. I never got the chance. I never even met him before. But these, these houses also have like an annex, like an outer sort of a wing that includes like maybe an outdoor kitchen and area for, for the driver and the meat to sleep and, um, some storage area as well. And he had fled, he jumped into the, uh, our house. Um, he fled into the annex and then by my uncle who lived at the house at the time, managed to get him out of the house just before the Iraqis came. Wow. They saw him. They came to come and he had, he fled, um, even though he was like leading from his legs and so on. Wow. Um, and so it was, and these Iraqis were the Republican guard. And again, I just want to emphasize everyone I spoke to. I spoke to about a dozen people in researching for this because, um, I started researching this two months ago because I had this big sort of epiphany. I was like, was the invasion contingent or not? Was it, was it at any point, uh, inevitable or not? And so I was talking to all of my family members, family friends, et cetera. And all of them made a point of distinguishing between the Iraqi Republican guard and the regular army, the conscripts. And the conscripts were like wearing tatters. They were very poor. Um, they would like a lot of Kuwaitis would actually help them out in terms of giving them food because they were always hungry. And so there was a sense of like, there was actually an informal bartering system, a sort of black market bartering system between those soldiers who would bring things like vegetables from Iraq and exchange them for things like, I don't know, small goods and so on. And the Republican guard who would come into the house and maybe steal your car, maybe find all your gold, all your furniture. And there were the Republican guard were the ones responsible for enforcing the occupation in terms of suppressing the any resistance, torture, executions. They would execute an entire family if they, if one of their relatives was found out to be in the resistance, which, you know, it was par on course for being a Republican guard. Kuwait was initially proclaimed to be the Republic. Saddam tried to prop up this sort of figment, the first, the first free provisional government of Kuwait under a dual, a dual Kuwaiti Iraqi citizen named Al-Aharusain, who was supposed to head this sort of provisional government that Saddam said he entered Kuwait to back against the sort of tyranny of the monarchy, which was a complete figment, was a complete Whoever, again, it's very similar to Ukraine. A lot of people may have not liked the monarchy before the invasion, but they were certainly not going to accept this government. It's like Chichenyatsu when Yeltsin went in, you know, that Dudaev was not popular. Things had just totally fallen apart. Then he became the hero, I mean, to this day, after the Russians invaded to restore order and install a real, you know, leader. Well, that did it, yeah, the first time around the special. Yeah, exactly the same thing here. Like the monarchy became a symbol of resistance in a way that even I think that Emir had no, no, like, did not think would be possible ever. Like the Emir himself, Jabber, I think he thought this was a gift from God. Like this invasion was delivery from God. And meanwhile, as far as I understand, he was in Ta'ith enjoying the nice cool mountain breezes. Yeah, the prick didn't even have the balls to be near the border, like in some sort of desert village in like 40 degree heat. He high-tailed it all the way to Ta'ith to enjoy the sort of, yeah, like you said, like a resort to it there, basically. Yeah, he set up a government in exile there and immediately went ahead lobbying the US, the UK and Saudi Arabia for plans to liberate, quote unquote, Kuwait. But the thing about the provisional government was it was so unpopular and they couldn't even find people to staff the bureaucracy. That's something my mom and others I interviewed mentioned that short of the, like, very urgent jobs like doctors, nurses, people who work the electricity and water systems, everyone went on strike. No one went to work, which was their way of resisting the occupation was just shutting down everything. What about getting sued and things like that? There was still, there were markets, everything was working that way. Yeah, I mean, there were markets in a sense that after the invasion, first of all, the first couple of days after the occupation, all the supermarkets in Kuwait were giving out all the food for free. It was an effort to like make sure every house was stocked with specifically non-perishable. So rice, lentil beans, dry pasta, flour, things like that. My mom said that the Iraqi women would come from Basra because Basra was very close to Kuwait to trade vegetables for goods or money. One of the chief jobs of the resistance, the Kuwaiti resistance, which I can talk about by the way, because there was a fairly decent resistance in terms of both military action and logistics. And the logistics aspect included smuggling goods across the Saudi Kuwaiti border to support the Kuwaitis and smuggling money to pay for goods like food specifically from Iraqi markets. But my mom did say that it was like they ate on very little. It was mostly rice and beans. There was no meat, there was no fish, there was no eggs, there was no milk, there was no vegetable, like vegetables were very basic, like onions, tomatoes, etc. There was not a lot of fruit, a lot of dates, they ate a lot of dates in addition to the rice and beans and water basically, that was it. Yeah, it's good that the water lasted though because you're really hyper aware of that in Kuwait, like there's massive number of people and there's not a lot of water there. I don't want to end up on a list, I'm probably going to regret that I'm going to say next. But if you ever want to take over the Gulf, like if you really, like you could take over the Gulf in about three days, if you just launch a salvo of scuds at their desolination plants, like the desolination plants are what keep these places from being like the surface of the moon basically. Yeah, I think John's made that point. Yeah, to your point John on that, actually my mom said that the water kept coming until the end of December, early January and then the water treatment facilities shut down because of the sanctions on Iraq limiting power, like electricity, both the Iraq and Kuwait, because being occupied Kuwait was experiencing the same result of the sanctions as Iraq proper. So my mom described that after that, the way they would get water was cars like tanker cars with like a tank at the behind the truck, would bring fresh water from Iraq once a week and they would have to like really ration their water, like really, you line up with sort of, well, I don't know, containers, right? And then they just come into your containers and you bring it home. Yeah, and the containers, you have them, you don't, the thing is what really was, what really hit home from the people I talked to was, you didn't know when the next tanker was going to come, it wasn't like consistent. So you had your containers of water and that could, you could need to that to last a week, maybe two weeks, maybe 14, like 15, 17 days. And it included everything from drinking to bathing to cooking. And the at Exorcite was knocked out in January as well. So they would just eat and candlelight, basically. That was, that was what was there. Like oil lamps was the only thing left, like using cooking oil, she said to light up the oil lamps at times. And yeah, just staying at home at most times, if not all times and just waiting really. Like, what really touched me that I don't think people, I think people imagine in the boredom you must have, like just sitting at home. Like sometimes I think I'm like, oh, it'd be fun if I just stayed at home and played video games all day or whatever. But like, I would probably lose my mind within five days and want to go out or something. Yeah. But if it's the only thing you can do, then something that's like, you start going crazy. Real quickly also though. So because your family, your mother side family, your co-80, but as you said about, I don't know, almost two thirds of the population are foreigners. How did they, I remember a lot of them were Palestinians, guest workers. How did they respond to the invasion? And the initial, like Saddam was saying, PR, this is actually an anti-imperialist invasion, although he didn't even bother with that for very long. Then he just said, no, actually we're swallowing it. But yeah, go ahead and tell me the story about that. So Saddam, Saddam really played into Saddam's hand was the Saudis inviting the Americans into Saudi Arabia within a couple of days of the invasion, which really helps Saddam frame this as an anti-imperial action. But with the Palestinians in particular, Kuwait had a massive Palestinian diaspora, massive. I mean, Yasser Al-Arafat himself was born in Kuwait. And the PLO had had quarters in Kuwait for a long time. And in terms of Al-Arafat himself, like the official PLO organs and Al-Arafat, they immediately expressed the port for Saddam. Now, this is a very dark memory, I think, and something that even I was surprised to hear a tone of regret with my mom and stuff. Because there were a lot of Palestinians who either participated in the resistance with Kuwait or just actively fled because they didn't want to support the Iraqis. And I think I don't know if it was Leyla Khaled or someone else who in decrying the invasion said that it would be hypocritical of us to fight the Israelis against an occupation and then support an occupation of another people. So a lot of Palestinians were quite brave in that sense. But a lot of the PLO types, especially head, back, Saddam because Saddam was paying lip service to being an anti-imperialist and had at various erratic times when he felt like he needed to shore up support, launch Scott Missiles at Israel. Just the fact that he launched Scott Missiles made him to the PLO at least a reliable ally. And at that point, the PLO was in its last legs. I mean, they were kicked out of Jordan after Black September. They were on the edge of being kicked out of Lebanon during the civil war. So yeah, the PLO had been fucked off the tunis. And I mean, I don't want to say I understand out of thought. But like given that Saddam was one of few people at the time who looked like he might be a threat to Israel, he wasn't like objectively. There was no at all no threat to Israel from Saddam. But just the rhetoric alone would have appealed to out of thought to support him. We should explain to people, most people will know this. But I mean, the Lebanon War, the Lebanon invasion by Israel in 1982 was officially designed to force the PLO out of Beirut, which had been its headquarters. And then force them all the way over to Tunisia, which was considered a great humiliation. I mean, it was a double humiliation because that happened almost less than a decade after the PLO was expelled from Jordan after Black September. Right. It smells like a lot of casualties. Yes. Yes, a lot of casualties, a lot of casualties. And so I mean, Saddam offered weapons, he offered money, he offered rhetorical support, political support in a way that the PLO at the time was facing so much humiliation that you take what you can get, I guess. But the dark side of that is that after Kuwait was liberated, tens of thousands of Palestinians were expelled from Kuwait for collaborating with the Iraqis or being suspected of collaborating with the Iraqis. And then the case for was it that all Palestinians were expelled? It was not case by case, it was all Palestinians except those Palestinians that can have at least two Kuwaitis vouch for their integrity, which ended up being like a couple of dozen people at most because even the ones that weren't or didn't support Iraq, didn't collaborate at all were, you know, just they stayed and create, but they didn't collaborate. They left at the end because my mom's description was, well, who was going to believe them? You know, there was very strong anti-Palestinian sentiment, like general anti-Palestinian xenophobia among the Kuwaitis that it was on, it became an unwelcome environment even for those Palestinians that didn't support Saddam. And it's very sad and depressing and a very dark side of the Kuwaitis, the result of the Kuwaiti occupies. Even in Saudi, I couldn't help seeing the humiliation of the foreign workers and their resentment of it. So it's pretty easy to understand why when they were seeing the discomforture of the people who'd been their masters basically, that they would jump at the chance. But again, it's not smart. I mean, when you're dealing with an invasion or a complete apparent overturn of normal relations, you got to think hard. You got to think who's going to win this thing? Who's going to end up in power? I mean, from a purely moral perspective, like I said, the Layla Khaled, quote, text to me, which is the one where she says that, you know, we can't be hypocrites about fighting one occupation and supporting the other. But you're right in the sense that on a pragmatic perspective as well, like Kuwait was also funding Palestinian activities and Kuwait was much richer. But also the fact that Kuwait was much wealthier, also bread resentment, like you said, John. Saddam played to that where even before the invasion and the lead up to the invasion, one of his, the drums he kept banging about trying to resolve disputes with Kuwait was, how come this small country with such a small population has all this oil wealth and is refusing to share it with its Arab brothers and sisters and refusing to use the wealth to liberate Palestine? Right. Right. And that found a very receptive audience and a lot of Pan-Harab corners. Absolutely. Quick question. I remember from that time too, that also King Hussein of Jordan, at least publicly, made a big show of supporting or sympathizing with Saddam Hussein, if I remember correctly. Whereas the Syrians joined with the American coalition, invasion coalition. Was that because of Jordan's Palestinian population or is it more complicated than that? Part of it is that throughout politics of the Palestinian population, the fact that Jordan got something like 70% of its oil from Iraq. Iraq was Jordan's biggest trading partner. The Iraq paid Jordan to use the Akhaba port on the Red Sea because again, and we can go back to this as one of the reasons of the war was Iraq had no access to deep sea ports. So using the Akhaba port, the Jordan's Akhaba port, they would pay Jordan to use that to these parts of it. That was a lot of money for Jordan because Jordan, there's nothing there. There's not on the economy. It's not an oil rich country. It's a nothing rich country. There's no foreign, there's no oil. Well, people, they export a lot of skilled people and export them to some of those countries where it's built on remittances. Right. Right. Okay, so getting back to the occupation, how widespread was the resistance? And I know you're going to have some personal stories to tell here. Do we know much about the resistance or the scale of it? The problem, as John described earlier, Kuwait was just one big city. It wasn't like a very large country in terms of having the geography did not facilitate a guerrilla campaign. Right. The way it would in other places. You can hide out in the mud and the dried mud flats. Yeah, yeah, just there while blowing up. Gains yourself with mud like being nude like Arnold Schwarzenegger in the first predator movie. But I mean, there was a resistance in a sense that when the invasion first happened, those delaying actions by different pockets of resistance helped others basically ransack the armories in the sense that a lot of small arms were taken and hidden by people in their houses to be used in the case of a general uprising. But until then, the resistance had two tasks. One was ensuring the well-being of Kuwait, he's in terms of smuggling food and money. And the other task was basically making life uncomfortable for the occupier. And their methods involved car attacks, like driving into checkpoints and crashing into soldiers, knife attacks and occasional rifle attacks. And the response was brutal. Initially, there was also a public face to the resistance in terms of, quote unquote, non-violent rallies, gatherings, protests, things of that nature, where Kuwaitis would go gather and wave flags and things like that. But the Iraqis immediately cracked down on that. So just to underline what I'm going to say next, when Kuwaitis initially became the free republic, whatever it was called, that lasted up until August 28, which was yesterday, by the way. So if we recorded it yesterday, Otis said, happy birthday to the republic. The briefs had re-gray in the republic. The republic, yeah. Yeah. And then once I don't realize there was not going to be a buy-in, he managed to just annex this to the 19th governor of Iraq and put his cousin Ali Majid Al-Hasan on to be the governor of occupied Kuwait. And you might know Ali Majid for a very particular, Ali Hassan Al-Majid, sorry, not Ali Majid. This is not chemical Ali, is it? This is chemical Ali. Wow. He has a jolly nickname of chemical Ali and I think you can get cards from him. The cards remember him, the Shia remember him because he was also in addition to the NFL campaign, which included the chemical attacks on Halabja. He was responsible for the dojil massacre, executing about 200 Shia men in dojil in response to an assassination attempt on Saddam by the Dawah party, which was the sadrist group in Iraq. And so Saddam put him in as governor of Kuwait and you know, how do I say this? When Saddam puts him as governor of place, he means business. It's like sending a luca barat. He's like the luca barat of the back party. The rallies stopped because the Iraqis cracked down the sort of nonviolent rallies and it became a matter of Republican guard trying to identify resistance members and entertain them and the resistance living in underground and launching sort of single attacks on checkpoints and small groups of Iraqi squads. Like I said, usually with cars, knives, some sort of riot. And were these suicide attacks or were they intended to get away? They weren't suicide. They tried to get away but when they didn't, they weren't planning on suicide. They were just detained and tortured. But there was a sort of, it was very much a self structure in the sense that if you were tortured, you can only give up so much information. You were only told very little information. You know. But your family, you know, was going to think about it. Which goes back to my story about my uncle because he was a kid. He was not part of the resistance. He was a college student at the time and he was thought to be identified to be a member of the resistance. But because he was really young, so what they did, the Iraqis, they detained him. They take him to a local police station. They keep him waiting in a room for three hours alone. No water, no food, no one to talk to. Just to like build out attention. And then according to him, one of the chief officers of the Republican group in that area comes up to him, takes him out of the room and walks with him down a hall and shows him in each room in this hall different members of the resistance being tortured. Usually with cables, with electric shock, he said there were people hanging from screaming and they were hanging from types on this roof by their hands, stress position type situation. And basically at the end of the hall, the colonel turns to my uncle and tells them, if we see you again, you're going to end up in one of these rooms. Now fuck off. What would make an impression? Yeah. Yeah. He only told this to the rest of his family years after the invasion. His parents, his dad, his mom was in Egypt. We talk about the Quayte diaspora in Egypt as well. I have stories there. But he told my mom and her dad, my granddad, years after the invasion. At the time, they were really worried because he had disappeared for the entire day and came late at night. And he just said that he was out running errands and he didn't tell them what he saw until way later. Wow. God. How old was he, roughly, do you know? He was 19. He was lucky. Yeah. He was 19. Maybe like, yeah. Yeah. If it wasn't for this one colonel who thought he'll just put the fear of God in him. Like if it was another colonel who was maybe more bloodthirsty, maybe there was a quote to it to be filled for the week in terms of detaining people, numbers, etc. He could be in one of those rooms. And there's still, I think at this point, there's about 500 people that remain unaccounted for in terms of disappeared from Quayte and no one's found their bodies. The Iraqis have not released any documents to show what happened to them. Sort of 500 people. Yeah. Well, yeah. And if we're talking mafia movies, there's Joe Pesci's line about it. And then you have to dig another hole. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look at Lake Mead. Yeah. Frankly, though, I'm disappointed. I thought there'd be a lot more than five bodies on the meat. I'm a lit. Give it time. Give it time. Give it time. Yeah. One question that occurs to me, and I think it's occurred to a lot of people who worked in countries with a large emigrate or guest worker population. Why did, well, or did the Iraqi occupiers try to use the Palestinians in particular and other guest worker groups as collaborators? Of the expat population. The Palestinians and some Egyptians were collaborators, Jordanians, Palestinians, Egyptians, the rest, not at all, Indians, Pakistanis, Filipinos. These people just wanted to get home. And there are countries put in a lot of effort in convincing Saddam to release them, which she did after a month. He opened the land border just for expats, but not for Western expats. So he kept several dozen Brits and several dozen Americans as hostages, which I think he ended up releasing at the end of the war. Did you famously have some expats, young boy or children, and you sort of like they're safe here? He did not have Hill and Nolton working for him. He had a bad PR agency working for him. He had an intern. It was a summer intern. It was responsible for him. Yeah. There was a lot of photo ops, yeah, with like young blue eyed blond kids running around. And it's like, no, they're guests the same way that the kids in Game of Thrones were guests. Like, they're guests, but like, they would be short ahead if anything were to happen. But nothing, he didn't do anything because he realized very quickly he was fucked. And that was impressive was like how quickly he realized he was screwed and tried to negotiate a deal in which he would withdraw his, he was open to withdrawing his troops by the end of August. But a lot of, a lot of things were like, like, once that tree and left the station, there was no going back. Like, HW Bush and his people were already like just salivating at the idea of like, you know, big like TV show of like showing off the new planes, the new bombs, the new troops. And and what, like, whatever deal Saddam was trying to make, he was trying to save his life. Because he was just going to withdraw without some compromise. So his biggest thing was, right, I'll withdraw a few end sanctions. And if you facilitate a way to negotiate with Kuwait over the disputes, and we can go into this now about like the background to the war. But there was no, for HW and the Americans, once, once UN resolution 660 passed and then 661 and 662, there was no going back. withdraw was going to be unconditional and without any sort of, you know, prerequisite. You withdraw and then we talk. And Saddam for a long time tried not to do that, understandably given his position. But yeah, it's, it's interesting that so many countries tried to act as middlemen, Jordan, Gorbachev and Sharzada, the, the, the, the, the, the, the future prime minister, well, foreign minister, Premakar, he's an Arab, I think. Yeah, he was, he was the Gorbachev Arab, Arab experts. So he sent the Baghdad, the French as well, Meterand, had his own efforts to, to negotiate with Thrall. But HW and the British, those two parties were the ones that were just, just like, you know, like, like a dog that teases a steak, like a, like a lunatic, a dog seeing a steak that are like, this is perfect. There was a story. And I'm not sure how true it was that Pappy, George Bush senior, at first, kind of, um, was caught flat foot and didn't really know exactly how to react. Or it was a little wishy washi and that, uh, that sure had a talk with him. And the quote was something like she, um, implanted a spine in him. And then after that, he was just absolutely gung ho. See, I don't know about that because I feel like Poppy, um, did really well to portray himself as this like, I know, bumbling sort of, you know, not bumbling per se. That's his son, but like a sort of weak bureaucrats, hands kind of person, but like his, his role as a dog, he was a psycho. Yeah. Yeah. He was one of those wasp oil, oil, uh, people, you do not mess with their bone, you know, and the, and Kuwait was a bone. I agree. I'm just saying that was a, that was the story that went around a lot. Maybe it was a, I remember, yeah, I remember a quote that she supposedly said, like, don't go wobbly on us now, George. Yeah. Something else. Yeah. But maybe that was just British. The Brits had their own hill in Nolton, you know, to make them so it was out to be the, the real hand behind it. But, um, uh, yeah, I, you know, another thing is, look, the economy was starting to go, this is like the savings alone crisis was starting to really spread. This is like the, the preview to the 2008 crash in a sense. And, um, uh, so there was the 1992 eventually elections to look forward to. And I remember again, I, I mentioned last episode from reading a Woodward book about, um, Bill Casey's time. There was another Woodward book about the, the Bush senior administration. Puh. This went up to like 1990. I think it went up to before the Iraq war. But I, I just never, we'll never forget this one quote. This is about the Panama invasion, um, that when they were discussing what to do, when that when the Bush administration top brass people were discussing what to do about Norega, who was the big bad evil Hitler guy before said, I'm saying, um, Bush had said, and it was like a truism in Washington, or at least among some psychos, that you're, you're never a real president until you've had a war. And it, once you've had a war, like basically your, your next election is secured and your place in history is secured. And it's funny how that doesn't really work out for him, but they believe it. Yeah. It didn't work for him. It, well, I guess W got reelected, but you know, ended up like the most failed president ever. And, um, I mean, W got elected in no small part because the Democrats pretty much fumbled the ball at every opportunity in 04, no? Yeah, I mean, you know, that's, that's also part of it. But, um, I mean, the Iraq war invasion of W's invasion is not what won him the 2004 election. Let's put it that way. Um, so yeah, it's, but that, that was definitely the thinking. And so, um, uh, you know, yeah, they love the idea. You got all these freaking weapons that were bought in the Reagan years. I mean, there had never been a peacetime sort of build up of, of, of weaponry before. And it looked like a good bet. I mean, there was talk. I remember about, oh, the Iraq has the fourth biggest army in the world and they have these sand berms and, and they're really good with tanks. But at the same time, the, the US armed forces of that era were designed to handle, uh, armor heavy opponents fighting a Soviet style war. And above all, they were designed to fight in desert slid. There was a joke in that, uh, what was that John Woofilm, um, broken, broken arrow or something like that, where, uh, Christians later says to John Travolter, if we ever go to war with Utah, we are going to kick ass. This was like the nearest thing to go into war with Utah. At your point, John, I just want to mention that first of all, yes, the, uh, if the Iraqi army was very much modeled on Soviet doctrine of armor heavy movement, but it's also important to remember that this occupation and, and the response by America came just two years or three years, um, after the end of the Iran-Iraq war. And the Iraqi army was decimated and depleted by then. Um, the occupation, my mom describes like, the, the, the, the trucks and their cars were falling apart. Like, they were relying on the 50s era T 55s. Um, and, uh, they're the only good thing were their planes. Um, most of their armor was old armor. Most of their, uh, uh, uh, uh, trucks, um, mechanized divisions were using like very, very archaic, uh, uh, machines. I would have thought they would steal, um, the Mercedes. There were a lot of Mercedes's in Kuwait. They did. Eventually they did, but, um, I mean, the Mercedes were like, like, like, they stole the Mercedes to flee. And then, of course, the highway of death happened. So, right, right. Which I have an interesting, uh, several notes from, um, uh, a friend of the family who worked, um, uh, at the time with the Red Crescent, like the Muslim Red Cross. Um, and he was one of the first people to arrive at the highway of death after it happened. And his description of the smell was made me dizzy just hearing about it. Yeah. The highway of death was when, uh, the US, uh, caught large numbers of Iraqi forces. Supposedly, mostly Republican guard, I don't know if that's true. They were trying to, that was not true. Okay. Trying to flee back into Iraq and, uh, incinerated them. They're mostly conscripts. The Republican guard had successfully withdrawn several days before the ground invasion. We're talking tens of thousands killed, right? And it was large numbers. One quote that sticks out to me and my notes here is, um, he says something along the lines of, at some points, you don't know where the corpses end and the cars begin. Oh, wow. That took a while to come out in the US press. I seem to remember when I finally came. It was sort of the, I mean, the real descriptions of it came out later in the 90s. I think it was Sy Hirsch and the New Yorker wrote about it. And people were sort of, were genuinely appalled. But one thing I wanted to say also about the, the thinking of the, but of the US and London about what had to be done with St. Amesain was, um, I mean, and to your point was that there couldn't be a negotiated withdrawal. That basically, St. Amesain could not be allowed to get away, not even, he could not be allowed to think he could get away with it was the thinking or else, you know, the liberal global world order, the new world order as, as Poppy was calling it, you know, would be, um, forever threatened. So a lesson had to be taught that he had to be, he had to come away from this totally defeated and no mistake about it whatsoever. And the reason I think that has kind of relevance to today too, because the strategy, although it's becoming a little bit more muddled now, but the strategy of sort of NATO, G7 countries, about what to do in Ukraine. I mean, there's been no diplomacy, right? I mean, no real, or at least, uh, no, no hard, like attempts at diplomacy. And there's been a lot of talk that we can't, this war must end only one way with Putin so defeated that he can never do anything like this and everybody else understands that they can't do anything like this. So then, you know, with the idea that, well, that's how it worked with Saddam Hussein and I guess in their minds that worked out well and kept the liberal global order intact. But um, they're applying that strategy to Russia and Russia is not Iraq. There's this weird brain bug, uh, in the beltway and the sort of the acela corridor that the way, the only way to resolve a war is always, there's always that sort of world war two idea that you have to like march into Berlin or whatever the equivalent of Berlin is. There's no like, there's no understanding that you could resolve a war through negotiation, through compromise, through some sort of, uh, deal where people can save face like your enemy can save some sort of face and, and, and present this deal to his because when you have a war, right, each, each person, like whatever you call them, or a G, my guess, whatever leaders, Saddam, whatever, I don't know what you call them, but they have a constituency. They have an, uh, an audience to answer to. And if you can't give them something to break back and spin it as a sort of a good deal or at least an okay deal, there's no incentive for them to, to negotiate and I'm just going to make everyone suffer. But who cares because, you know, for the acela corridor types, all they do is they get to write op eds and make fucking, uh, 200 K a year and then build them a dimension in Virginia. They're not the ones suffering from this. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's, uh, it's, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's something you messed up thinking and, um, deeply ingrained. Go ahead, John. No, I was just going to say a lot of destroying certain countries has been a long-term goal for the beltway. I mean, uh, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, er, You're destroying a nuclear armed country is kind of dangerous, but I think they absolutely do want them, and they absolutely wanted to destroy Iraq as well. Okay, I think at this point let's just take a quick break, come back and get into the background of the invasion. Okay, we are back, and I think now we're going to get into the background, the whole history of this, and, you know, because too much of the world, and certainly to Americans, I don't believe in the war. The war, the Iraq's invasion kind of came out of the blue for a few reasons. I mean, one was Iraq, throughout the 80s, Iraq was kind of considered a sketchy, but nevertheless, pretty much our friend because Iraqis were killing Iranians, and if there were one people that Americans viscerally hated and wanted to see hurt after the hostage crisis of 7980. I don't mean all Americans, but a lot of dumb Americans, and I would have put my younger self in this category would have been they wanted to see the Iranians and the I told them any hurt. From that humiliation, and so Iraq, so, you know, the US, the US back pretty much back to Iraq, you know, in that war. In a lot of ways, actually, I mean, we've talked about in the past, the US gave us, the Dhammussians military intelligence on where to gas, where to use poison gas, knowing poison gas is going to be cursors to the gas, like the pre-cursors. So here's the precursors. Here's the intelligence, you know, we don't know what you're going to do with it, but here's the gas, and here's where you could use the targets, and, you know, hope nothing happens. And so, but like when the Iraqis bombed one of one of the US naval ships in the Persian Gulf and killed a few dozen Americans, I think the Americans responded. This is 1988, I believe the Americans responded that by shooting down not Iraqis, but an Iranian passenger jet and killing 300 people. And so it was kind of odd, then suddenly have Saddam Hussein turn into Adolf Hitler very quickly. But anyway, that's my, my intro to this. So if you could talk about the background, like where did Kuwait? Yeah, what is Kuwait? Yeah. What is Kuwait? What is Kuwait? What is Kuwait is a good start because the term Kuwait really betrays a sense of its history. So Kuwait is the Arabic diminutive form of the word Kuwait, and the word Kuwait is an old Hindi term that means afford, a mud wall fort. And the Kuwait of the say 1700s was a fishing village. It was engaged in fishing, perling, shipbuilding. They were really good with the ships. The Kuwaiti ships were sold across the region. And trade with India was a gateway to India. And it was considered very important in terms of access to the British large in India. And in the 18th century, in the mid 18th century, a certain clan, the Sabah clan arrive in Kuwait. They're of the same, the Benny Ortebaq confederation as the Khalifa of Bahrain and the Sirouds, the House of Siroud. They're the same tribal confederation, the Benny Ortebaq. And the Sabah that Sabah branch arrive in Kuwait as this Bedouin raiders. And they make a deal with the mercantile elite of Kuwait because Kuwait again was a mercantile city or town or village really. And that the mercantile class would support the Sabah as a government, as a ruler, as sheikhs. And would pay the money and exchange the Sabah, would use their tribal manpower to defend Kuwait from raids by other tribal Bedouins. So like a protection racket, you know. I got to quickly ask Sabah because I have some relatives that are Sabah that's like Sephardic Arabic Jew basically. Is that it means that a very common Arabic last name as well, Sabah? Yeah, I mean Sabah. Sabah is quite common because Sabah ultimately means morning, like it's Arabic for morning. So yeah, I mean, the Sabah are Eastern Arab, Najdi, Najdi Bedouins. But I can imagine there are other like, you know, unrelated Sabahs that are townspeople or Sephardic Jews. The mercantile elite pays the Sabah money and Sabah used the money to build a mud wall around the town, which is where the term Kuwait comes from, Kuwait being a demilator because it was such a small village that it wasn't even a coup, it wasn't even a fort, it was a little fort. The Sabahs were really good when governing Kuwait. They managed to carve out a sense of autonomy. If not entirely an independent state, then definitely there were autonomous enough to deal with both the Ottomans and the British because at that time Kuwait was governed as part of the province of Basra, like the Ottoman province of Basra. But the Sabah, like their arrival and emergence, allowed them to negotiate deals with regional powers outside of Ottoman approval. And in 1899, Britain formalizes their previous transactions by making Kuwait a protectorate. And this is funny, John, because I know you mentioned before, you know, the naval base in Dunedin being built to protect against Russian attack or whatever. So apparently the reason the British signed the Treaty of protection with Kuwait is because at the time there were a lot of rumors flying in London that the Russians might build a railway through Iraq that terminates in Kuwait. The Russians again, the Russians and the British, you know, it's just every damn story. Yeah, I grew up with the the firm belief that what every Russian dreamed about was a warm water port. Oh, a warm water port. They was like genetic with them. That was their lifelong fantasy. And of course they had, I don't know, maybe it's not so much a port, but I mean, they had Sochi, which is a very subtropical, you know, it's a subtropical climate, not really a port city. No, no, no, no, that a seasca, I guess would have been their warmest port, but I guess not warm enough for the minds of the British. I don't know, I was like, I don't know, you guys know more than me about like, you know, I guess Russian history like was Sars Russia, even in a position to build that kind of infrastructure project through Ottoman land? No, no. Well, the British would have intervened anyway. Yeah, it would have been the British plus the Ottomans, and that was settled in the Crimean War. But there was no way on earth that they could have done that. Yeah, but somehow those rumors sort of terrified people in London enough to sign the deal with Kuwait to make it an official protectorate. Even though like it was understood that it was a protectorate in a sense that Britain produced its naval facilities as it pleases and controls Kuwait's foreign policy, but officially on paper it was still considered part of Ottoman territory. It was like a quick pro quo. A district within Basra, right? Or something like that? Yes, it was a district within the province of Basra, the Wailaiet Basra, which is where the Iraqi claims to Kuwait all stem from. Right. And then of course, after the Ottomans collapse because the old man of Europe, etc, etc, etc, World War One. And after when the mandates were being handed out at Versailles and then Savr, the British got Iraq and, you know, Iraq up until then was just a geographical term. But the British managed to combine the provinces of Basra, Baghdad and Mosul into Iraq, the mandates of Iraq. But they cut off Kuwait from that. They sort of lock off Kuwait and they're like, right, Kuwait is no autonomous kingdom. It's a protectorate, but it's not part of the mandate of Iraq. So it's an entirely separate political entity. The problem with that because the British love nothing more than partitions that involve a lot of violence. They just draw a line on a map that is supposed to separate Kuwait from Iraq, even though, you know, the mercantile class of Kuwait at the time was very much embedded in Iraqi, politics, society and culture. Like all the elite Kuwaitis had holiday homes in Basra where they would go to flee the sort of awful climate of Kuwait. Like they would summer in Basra and the weekends would be in Basra. And it was also more cosmopolitan. And as far as the mandate of Iraq was concerned, the British decided that they weren't going to manage it as a colony. So they wheel out King Faisal from ICE because they had put him on ICE after they supported the roads against the Hashemites in Arabia. And they're like, hey, you said you wanted the kingdom, don't you? And he said, well, yeah, I want a kingdom of Arabia. And they're like, well, how about the kingdom of Iraq? It's kind of like Arabia, isn't it? And I guess, you know, if you're facing a good... You're like, this is a good... Yeah, I'll take that. It's all like he had any other options to be fair. I mean, you know, so they put him up on a throne as the British mandate becomes a monarchy in 32. And since 32, one of the biggest issues was when the mandate ends, which was in 1932, the Iraq was going to apply to the League of Nations under British endorsement. But in order to enter the League of Nations, that's very effective body that we all know and love. You needed to have both sovereignty and well-defined territorial borders. Iraq had two border issues that were big question marks. The Shaltala Arab with Iran, which prompted the Iran-Iraq war. And the border with Kuwait, which was very much undefined. At the time, a lot of Kuwaitis, especially the elite, they had a sort of, let's say, leaning of unity with Iraq because Iraqi at the time was very prosperous in terms of oil. It was cosmopolitan. It was culturally significant. Whereas Kuwait was considered a backwater. There was no oil discovered there yet, right? That comes later. Yeah. And then it comes in late 1930s, oil is discovered in Kuwait. And that's when the Kuwaiti sentiments flip entirely because they're now there. Well, we don't want to share the oil with those people. Like it's not more the fuck off. And this creates the border disputes because a lot of the oil fields of Kuwait are in that area between Kuwait and Iraq. That no one has any idea what belongs to whom. And at this point, Iraq makes the claim that Kuwaitis part of Iraq because of the Ottomans. The Ottomans include Kuwaitis part of Basra. Therefore, if the province of Basra is part of Iraq, then by definition, Kuwaitis part of Iraq. But being diplomatic, the Iraqis left a lot of room for negotiations in terms of like, well, you know, we consider you part of us. But if you're willing to negotiate the borders, we won't claim sovereignty over the entire country. In 32, the prime minister at the time, General Nureus Saeed validates a previous exchange between two British agents of the crown, one, by the name of agent Moore, and one by the name of agent Cox. Cox was in Iraq as the high commissioner of Iraq. Moore was advisor to the Kuwaiti Sheikh, the Sabah Sheikh. And they had exchanged letters in which the border was delineated. And in 32 Saeed approves of that. But the problem is that unlike Kuwait, which was a Sheikhdom, so whatever the Sheikh says goes, Iraq at the time was a constitutional monarchy. And any foreign correspondence that involves a treaty or a deal would need to be approved by a parliament and ratified by the king. And neither of that happened for those correspondences in the thirties. In 38 Kuwaiti Sheikh Ahmed was the Sabah Sheikh at the time, his name was Ahmed. He was pressured by the merchants to accept a legislative assembly, the first such legislative assembly in the region, with actual like very, very robust powers in terms of controlling the wealth. So like control the budget and it had the budget including the oil income, the very lucrative oil income. But it takes about a year and Ahmed realizes that this is not tenable. So he calls on allied tribes from Saudi and within Kuwait and dissolves the parliament. And then there is a period where like, you know, a lot of a lot of conflict, like, you know, internal conflicts between the Sabah royal family and the mercantile elite. This ultimately results in world war two during world war two in the Sabah being pressured by the British to accept some sort of concessions to a legislative assembly because the British wanted stability in Kuwait as a way to ensure access to India. And especially because of the time, you know, al-Alamin, etc. etc. there was some certain genuine fears that the Suez Canal was going to be shut down. So one of the big issues then was Iraq, due to the way the British drew the borders between Kuwait and Iraq, Iraq had only one deep water port and it wasn't really a deep water port. There was a lot of limitations to it. It was called on Hassan. Okay. So the biggest port city in Iraq is Basra. And Basra is about 200 and some kilometers up the Shatul Arab, the river that drains into the river that is a result of the Tigris and Euphoraties combining into this massive estuary that drains into the Gulf. And it's 200 kilometers up that. And so ships, the problem is that the river, there's a lot of silt. It's a eluvial plain. I noticed that when I was trying to check out the site of Ur, you know, the Great Sumerian city. And it's near Baghdad or at least Najaf. I mean, it's way up there now because the river has been filling up with silt for thousands of years. So Basra, even though it's on the Shatul Arab, it doesn't have access to deep sea ships because of the silt. And it has to be dredged all the time too, just to normal, like small ships through. And Iraq needed a port because it needed to ship out oil. Currently, it had to pay Jordan to use the Aqaba port or have a pipeline to Turkey. And Turkey, of course, would take a cut as a middleman. So, you know, you look at Kuwait. Kuwait has Kuwait city, which is a very, very good port, very well situated. And ships could anchor there, including like super tankers. And after World War II, the Iraqis rebuilt a port that the British had used and demolished at the site of Umkasa, which is right on the border of Iraq and Kuwait. And this in this area that actually I wonder if I can send you guys a map if you can include it in the episode notes to describe this area because it's like there's two sort of estuaries that go off Shatul Arab, which are Hore Abdellan, Hors-Ubaer. And these two small estuaries drain to an area of the Gulf that the part where they drain into the mouth of their rivers, it's bordering two big islands, Uwarba and Bobyan. And most two big islands, Uwarba and Bobyan are considered part of Kuwait, Kuwait, Lee, Sabar, and T2. And Umkasa is built on the mouth of the rivers. But if Kuwait chooses strategically security wise, they could easily block off access to Umkasa through those islands by just stationing a force on those islands and being like, well, this port's out of service now, why buy? And so as far as the Iraqis were concerned, building a port and Umkasa was a temporary solution until they could find a more a more reasonable compromise with Kuwait over security concerns. And the British being, you know, as we all know and understand that British love to resolve conflicts between different parties. Multi-confident, they've created. Yeah. It's for the good of mankind, that's it. The great business model of creating conflicts and then coming back 100 years later and being like, right, we can resolve this now. So they say, okay, look, we'll draft an agreement between the Sheikhdom of Kuwait and the Iraqi government in which we'll let Umkasa be built despite Kuwaiti objections. Warriba will, the island of Warriba will remain under Kuwaiti sovereignty, but Iraq can lease it for some amount of money that you guys can agree on for security purposes. And the demarcation line of the border will be moved a thousand meters south, which favors Iraq. But in return, Iraq must guarantee fresh water supplies from the Shutal Arab for Kuwait, because Kuwait, you know, like we said, it's like the surface of Mars. There's normally water supplies. And then of course, 50, this happened in 55 and then things happen in the region outside of both parties concerns. And then, you know, the U.S. crisis, you know, and the British role of the Suez crisis makes them completely untenable to mediate anywhere in the region. And at the time, Iraq was an ally of Britain, because it was still the monarchy. It was like a NATO that brought the Baghdad pact. There was supposed to be a counterweight to the, what's it called the thing between Syria and Egypt, the United Arab Republic. But really the Soviet Union ultimately, because that's all the Russia. Yes, the UAR was backed by the Soviets. So in return, the British managed to corral Iraq Jordan, both ruled by Hashemite kings and formed this thing, the Baghdad pact, also known as the Arab Federal Union. That was supposed to be like the U.S. and the UK's outpost in the region. And then three years later Kuwait gains official independence. The protectorate treaty is ended and Kuwait becomes an Emirate instead of just a shake them. So like they have an Emir now. As soon as they're independent, this, at this point, I should note that in 1958, Ku occurs in Iraq. The Abdul Karim Qasim Kuh. Yes. And Qasim is like a pan-Arabist, but he also is a rival of Nasr. He really is like Nasr and Waisar hated him. And one of his, in order to bolster his pan-Arab Bonafidez, Bonafides, I don't know how you pronounce that. Bonafides, you can say. Yeah, Bonafides. As soon as Kuwait declares independence in 1961, he leaves Kuwait. He's like, Kuwait has always been part of Iraq, Yariyariyara. He moves troops within Iraq, but doesn't make a move for Kuwait, which really discredits him to the military. And is one of the several reasons for the coup in Iraq, the counter-Kuh in which Qasim is overthrown by his lieutenant, Arif. Abdul Salah Arif. And so in 1963, when Arif overthrows his former mentor, Qasim, he recognizes Kuwait. He realizes that having a claim on Kuwait, it's not a fight he was willing to fight. So he recognizes sovereignty of Kuwait. And they agree on the deal that the British had negotiated. Not the whole deal. The war-ball islands were still up in the air. Qasir Pors were still up in the air, but the general border as delineated in the 50s was agreed upon. And then, of course, the Iran and Iraq war happens in, I'm fast forwarding. No, it's good. I mean, you're doing a great job here because I know you're probably missing stuff, but it's... You're doing a great job here. Yeah, I don't want to go into the weeds, but I'm just trying to cover the important things. So, you know, Qasim, and then Arif overthrows Qasim, and then the bath party comes into power in 68. That's the one thing I want to point out. In 68, the bath party comes into power, and it's under Ali Al-Bakir with Saddam being his number two. And Saddam, at that point, was like a Muslim for the bath party, like a Luka Barasi figure. But imagine if the Corleonis were led by Luka Barasi, which would be very interesting movie, actually. But I mean, yeah, I'm trying to like underline a lot of what Saddam's logic will be later on in the sense that he was always a Muslim. He didn't have the mind for geopolitics and international relations, how to deal with Soviets, how to deal with the Iranians. And then Gorbachev hated him. Gorbachev despised Saddam. Gorbachev loved Fatcher and Reagan. So, you know, that's Gorbachev. Yeah. The Soviets in general were very skeptical of Saddam because when Iran, Iraq war happens in 1980. At that point, Iraq was supposed to be an ally of the Soviets. They had signed several treaties, including a 72. I'm part of that treaty included that the Iraqis would inform the Soviets of any major foreign policy decisions. And Saddam didn't inform the Soviets about invading Iran until after the invasion was happening. Well, yeah, I mean, he didn't think it was a big deal. Oh, yo, you wanted to hear about that. But this is just, this is going to be over in three weeks. It's the big deal, right? Yeah. Which at the time really made a drop of livid. But the Iran-Iraq war, what's really important in the context of this episode is that in 84, so the Iran-Iraq war drags on Saddam gets pushed back. There is a sort of World War I slash World War II style, like, you know, changing of the front a few kilometers left, a few kilometers right across the entire front from south to the Iraqi Kurdistan in the north. And in 84 Iran launches a major counteroffensive that captures the southern peninsula of Faou, Al Faou. And Saddam realizes that his entire army could be encircled. If Iran uses the Kuwaiti islands of Bobeyan and Wadaba to launch a flanking maneuver around his troops. And so he calls up Kuwait and says, don't you dare let the Iranis use the islands. So the Kuwaitis, you know, have to publicly announce that they will not let the Iranians use the islands. The Iranians make a smart move of not doing that because they don't want to alienate. Or, I mean, obviously at that time the Gulf countries were back in Saddam to the North. I was going to say that the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the Saudis and the, well, in the Gulf countries they were back in Saddam was saying that they had to take the Kuwaitis. Yeah, to the right to the tune of billions of dollars and loans. But the Iranians were very smart. Like at the time they were being led by Akbar Hashem Yaraf Sanjani. Yes. Yeah, he understood that even though they were backing him financially, he didn't want to drag them into this kinetic war because then America would get involved because of oil. And, you know, he, it would be too messy in terms of support by other countries. They liked Iran less, but they were also not comfortable with Saddam. Because he represented that, well, that, that fading threat at that time of people didn't know. But, you know, sort of, well, Saddam and a much more degraded way, but left wing Arab nationalism, which was a threat to Gulf, like the Gulf monarchy system. Right. So, but, but it was like, well, but we'd rather have him than, then, then, Khomeini went basically. Because Khomeini, when he first came to power was openly talking about exporting the revolution to the region, like the Islamic revolution. But at the same time, yeah, I mean, you could say that they didn't like Saddam, but they were also scared of Saddam, to be honest. Yeah, exactly. The Gulf countries were terrified of Saddam because, again, to go back to what I said earlier, he's a Muslim. He's a Boor. One of the reasons half of the Assad, he said, hey, Saddam was because Saddam was like very much a vulgar sort of Boor who only understood violence and military might. And so the Gulf, Gulf monarchy is all new. They didn't have none of them had the capacity to resist the Iraqi army or they thought they didn't. I mean, maybe, but so they were willing to fund him as a way as a sort of protection rocket. Like, hey, here, have this money. Go fight the Iranian. Hopefully this war will last the next 100 years and you can keep yourself busy over there. And we'll be over here selling oil on the cheap and making a lot of fucking money. Because oil, you know, on the cheap in a sense that they're increased supply, but also it wasn't cheap because the price kept going up because of the degraded oil capacity of both Iran and Iraq in terms of export. It was basically like that scene from arrested development where the Lucille, Lucille Bluth gives the Aniyang Amaniang says, here's $10. Go see a Star Wars, except it's go go fight with the Iranian. Yeah, it's basically to echo the great Mehrachim Begi in Israel when he found out about the start of the war. He's like, I wish the best of luck to both participants. Yeah. Well, these rallies helped arm the Iranians, you know, which is one of the weird side stories. No, if you guys want, we should do a review of, I know you guys did an Iran Iraq war, but there's so much interested stuff like this. Yeah, there's a lot of them. They do know Mousad assassinated a Canadian scientist in Brussels that was working with the Iraqis on nuclear. Yeah, it's an amazing. Imagine if any other country did that, like their intelligence. Fucking the Russians botched the surji's scrupal thing and everyone lost their fucking mind. I know. Yeah, no, there was there was a Franco Israeli film about that with that I saw the patriots, I think. Yeah. It was celebrating this as a wonderful coup for Mousad. The Iran Iraq war ends in 88. And at this point, Iraq was 80 billion dollars in debt, 10 billion of which was to Kuwait. And all of its oil infrastructure was destroyed because most of it was in the south and the Iranians had had fucking smashed it to bits. And so much like the scene from Goodfellas, Saddam didn't understand that if you take money from the Gulf minorities, you need to pay it back. It's like your house is on fire, fuck you, pay me. The structure is destroyed, fuck you, pay me. He opens talks with the Kuwaitis about oil because the Kuwaitis were pumping way over their quota, their OPEC quota. Their OPEC quota was 1.03 million barrels per day. They were pumping 1.7 million barrels per day. To the point where the cost of a barrel was 18 billion dollars and just to break even the Iraqis needed at least $22 a barrel. Why would Kuwait do that? Not that I understand the oil industry, but why? Money. It doesn't matter because Kuwait had a lot of capacity, they could sell it for cheaper and still make a lot of money. Knowing who was in the White House at the time, HW Zapata Oil, etc. There are a lot of theories and I'm inclined, and again, my opinion here, not necessarily fact, but I am inclined to believe that, and we're going to go into it just a bit, but I'm inclined to believe that the Kuwaitis were given a lot of encouragement by the US to continue over pumping to maintain cheap oil for US markets. When the Kuwaitis told Americans, well, Saddam is threatening us, then they must have gotten some really solid security guarantees about what the Americans are willing to do in the backing Kuwait. Like you said earlier in this episode, I think you mentioned something about the economy wobbling at the time. Because of the servings of the loan crisis was really spreading, real estate was crashing. I mean, it was a pretty big deal. And James Baker, the Foreign Secretary of State, and I mean, really the Consulity to the Bush family, he famously said in the lead up to the war when they said, what's the war about? The war is about jobs, jobs, jobs, and you know, the cheap oil for that. You need cheap oil. But I mean, we still find you need \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e for it. But back then, it was absolutely axiomatic that you need cheap oil for that. That's what helped power the Reagan to the extent that there was a Reagan boom, you know, in the 80's was cheap oil. So yeah. Yeah, I mean, Saddam, Saddam to his credit understood that the Americans were playing a game. He just didn't understand what the game was. Yeah, because I remember in 1990, I remember because I was on board then, but reading, I was floating up in the universe. I was, I was just selling my dad, but I remember through his memory, I guess, 1990, the US Senate delegation led by Bob Dole had gone to Iraq. And Saddam was trying to build friendship with the Americans at the point because he needed to rekindle friendship with the Americans, especially because the Soviets were on their way that like, you know, the Soviets were out for lunch at this point. Yeah. So he was showing them that, okay, I don't have nuclear weapons. I don't have bio weapons. I do have chemical weapons, which by the way, you guys sold me. But I'm willing to negotiate a deal in which I limit my army, I guarantee that I won't attack Israel in return for you guys to go to Kuwait and make them fucking stop over producing oil. And Bob Dole and the senators that he was with were like, yeah, sure, whatever. And then obviously HW, which wasn't going to listen to them. Poppy was too busy trying to get the oil to just drop even less. Wasn't George W around this time involved with like Spectre 7 or, you know, our booster, one of those like oil firms that was actually in Bahrain, I think set up Bahrain. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, that's a whole nother story we won't get into, but yeah, you want to have another hour I could get it. I know that another time. Yeah, okay. Soros was involved in that too, by the way, but yeah, it's all these names come up over and over. Never get rid of them. So Saddam's trying to get the message out that and it's pretty well known, I guess at this point that the Kuwaitis are basically cheating and essentially stealing money from the Iraqis and the Iraqis are pissed off. And they're stealing money while also demanding that their debt be repaid. Yeah, $10 billion worth of debt fuck you pay me. Yeah, oil barrel $15 fuck you pay me. Yeah. Also, the other problem was that, well, the problem was that Kuwait was over drilling, yes, so were the Emirates, by the way, that was the other problem. The Emirates were up there with the Kuwaitis over drilling pastor quota. And even just to clarify at this point, there was no slant drilling, okay. Slantering could not have happened. No technology to allow slant time at the time. Was it weren't the Kuwaitis blame for slant drilling or the other? Yeah, that's what I want to clarify. Yeah, the Iraqis also accused the Kuwaitis of slant drilling into Iraqi oil field, especially the South Romaila oil field, but that wasn't physically possible by the technology they had at the time. It was just a way to like, you know, post-Hawk, Cossus, Belay, you know, whereas overproducing, they definitely were $1.7 million. So, $1.7 barrels a day, $700,000 barrels over their quota. That's a U.S. at this time. In the summer, there's an Arab summit in the summer of 1990 in May 28. Saddam brings up the same issues to the Arab League, but the Kuwaitis basically ignore him at this point, they're under a mere jober. And in July of 1990, we're just a month away from the invasion. The U.S. released several memos to all their embassies in the region titled a new policy guidance on the Iraq Kuwait dispute. And basically, the three highlights are that all the screws should be settled by peaceful means, not intimidation and threats that use a force. The U.S. takes no position on the substance of bilateral issues concerning Iraq and Kuwait. And this is the key one that I think Saddam didn't understand, you know, you have to read between the lines and also read it as which one is the most important to the three bullets. The U.S. is committed to ensuring the free flow of oil and independence and integrity of the Gulf countries. So Saddam, someone's April Glasspie and on July 25th, that famous Glasspie meeting. So he tries to see, to gauge at this point, how much effort the U.S. are willing to put into propping up Kuwait. Like what's how far will they go? So, you know, he tells our things like, look, we don't want war, but if you push us to war, we'll do war with Kuwait. We just want to live proudly, provide a good standard of living, not true by the way they just want the money for his clique. A lot of Iraqis, you know, if you ask the average Kurd or the average Chean on the south, what the standard of living was, well, you know. Glasspie does agree that the U.S. did not want higher prices for oil, but agreed that a cap or not a cap, but a compromise, let's say, between Iraq and Kuwait in which the price per barrel could be $22, $23, $24 would help you as oil producing states, i.e. Texas. But she also says that, look, I know, she, I mean, so that quote, by the way, from the WikiLeaks cable that she, that is released, that a glasspie cable. Quote, I know you need funds, and our opinion is that you should have the opportunity to rebuild your country, but we have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflict, like your border disagreement with Kuwait. And then when asking him about the build up of troops on the Kuwaiti Iraqi border, she says, quote, normally that would not be any of our business, but when this happens in the context of what you said on your national day, i.e. like his claims to Kuwaiti sovereignty, then it would be reasonable for me to be concerned for this reason, I received an instruction to ask you in the spirit of friendship, not in the spirit of confrontations regarding your intentions and quote. And he reassures her and then reassures Saddam reassures her and then reassures Husni Mubarak of Egypt the next day that no military action would be taken until the Iraqi delegation meets the Kuwaiti delegation in a planned summit in Jeddah, where King Fahad of Saudi Arabia is acting as mediator. And it's led that both allegations are led by each country's second and command, the Crown Prince Saddam Abdullah of Kuwait and Iraq's vice chairman of the revolutionary command council, Azat Ibrahim Abdul-Arab, that guy who ends up joining ISIS and becoming a major ISIS lieutenant. Wow, okay. Yeah, he comes he comes back later in our story for another episode maybe. Yeah, so they the plan was supposed to meet on the July 31st in 1990 to negotiate, but here's where things get interesting and where I, and again, this is just my personal opinion based on everyone I've talked to and the stuff I've read. I think that the Americans basically put a banana peel and Saddam just walked on it like they were baiting him into doing something stupid and he did because this is this is a mere job as instructions to crown Prince Sad on the night he left for Jeddah, quote, and he wrote this to him, okay, quote. We attend this meeting under the same conditions we agreed on, whatever you may hear from the Saudis or the Iraqis about the brotherhood and Arab solidarity forget it. Every one of us has his own interests. The Saudis want to weaken us so that it can process in the future to give them concessions in the neutral zones and by neutral zones they mean the area of the town of Khafji on the border of Kuwait and Saudiia that has a lot of oil, okay. The Iraq, the Iraqis want to compensate for their losses in the war at our expense neither of those should happen that is the view of our friends in Egypt, Washington and London insist on your discussions. We are more powerful than they imagine with all my wishes for your success job. I want to underline that is the view of our friends in Egypt, Washington and London, okay. So they must have had some very very solid guarantees that whatever the US ambassador is soft, sooping Saddam saying, you know, we're cool with everything. And meanwhile the Kuwaiti and Meir has been told, now we're going to back to you no matter what. Also, if you look back, like when the Iraqis invaded Kuwait, they invaded August 2nd at 1 a.m. Yet somehow the Meir and all of his family and high ranking ministers managed to get enough of a heads up to flee to Saudi Arabia without any interruption because the Iraqi Air Force had already launched its campaign against the airports and so on. So like, you know, how early they know about the invasion, how well prepared they were. And we've raised a lot of eyebrows within Kuwait afterwards. Like how did they know to get, you know, to take that vacation just before? Yeah, everyone I talked to has their own theories about who knew what when. There are some skepticism of the official narrative that the Kuwaiti government spouses. No one wants to go on record to talk about that for obvious reasons. But I mean, again, my opinions based on what I've talked to and what I've read. There was at least a guarantee by the US to Kuwait about the security. There was definitely a heads up to the Meir and his people about the invasion at least several days before it happened along with troop movements and so on. Whether April, GlassP was sort of telegraphing, putting a banana peel in front of Saddam out of like deliberate malice or whether she was kept in the dark by the HW Bush administration in terms of plausible deniability, that I don't know. You know, they could have just not told her. I think through a non-conspiratory and I'm someone who, you know, I like and I also believe in some conspiracies. People do get together and do bad shit. But there's a way of interpreting this I was thinking of, which is that the US position might have been sort of like what she said that the Kuwaitis should scale it back. The price of oil should be a bit higher. Texas, for example, was really hurting Texas from the savings and loan crisis. Like it got, when real estate collapse and the savings and loan industry collapse and the Bush family was, well, they got bailed out, but you know, I think it was Neil Bush owned famously owned one of those savings and loans. So that state needed higher oil prices. They may have thought that, you know, we want that we want this negotiation to go on Kuwait needs to be sort of like Kuwait needs to know that we will of course back them if they're actually fully invaded. So sort of that Kuwait needs to be pressured because these guys are kind of being greedy sons of bitches. And they should like we shouldn't just fully go on the side of Kuwait publicly, we should sort of be in between so that Iraq can apply enough negotiating pressure in order to get a better deal. I'm just trying to be devil's advocate here. And like this blew up in the Bush people's faces because Saddam as you said is a goon like I mean, you know, I was thinking about this like in the 90s in Russia, when you were when you had a racketeering group and you had a territory. And then you a new business was there, whatever you were going to bring a new business under your wing. I remember talking to a guy who ran like furniture and computer sort of trade in the kutuzuki prospect area. And basically the group of the representative will come to you like they won't just attack the first come to you you'll have meetings and you'll discuss like what sort of deal they want. And really what they're going to do is they're going to find out how much muscle you have and what would happen and like because ultimately they want to take over without a fight. And sometimes you wind up having to get into a fight or sometimes a fight is really worth it. But generally you just want to take over turf, you know, you show the people how many guns and people you have and who's backing whose politicians in your pocket and then the other group leaves. And then you get to be the racketeer of this business. And I feel like, you know, so Saddam tried to feel it out like a gangster. What sort of backing do these little shits and Kuwait have? How much are they going to be back is obviously I'm not scared of them. I'm only scared of the people who backed them. And he misinterpreted. But maybe you know the American should have known you would have misinterpreted that because they had a profile of him. And you know how you get messages across to him. And I'm trying to go either way, but I just feel like I think you bring a good point. I mean, on your point there, I mean, I wonder if maybe the Americans also may, I don't know if they miscalculated or maybe they thought that Saddam may have only wanted to use force to resolve the border disputes like to occupy the border but not go all the way into Kuwait. Exactly. So maybe they thought, okay, maybe he'll go onto the border, take it to islands. And then we as Americans will come down, sit at the table and manage to have shot a deal for everyone. But the fact that, okay, so what the other part of that delegation that went to Jeddah was as a Tebrahimidur, the representative of Iraq. And so the dumps instructions to him and I find these hilarious actually. If the Kuwaitis were to reveal their well-known obstinacy, then you may well tell them that we have pictures of Kuwait when it was a mud wall town. And the only border we are ready to recognize are those walls. So I mean, okay, so after after the Kuwaitis and the Iraqis meet in Jeddah, the meeting only lasts like 20 minutes because a parent from what I understand, the Iraqis were instructed to just leave if they there's no room for compromise. And based on what Jabr told Sad, there was not going to be any compromise. So the Iraqis just leave and then the next day on August 1st, the revolutionary command council meets in Baghdad. And so dump surprises actually the meeting by saying, we're going to annex all of Kuwait now, not just the oil fields and the islands. And his gamble, there were several levels to this. One was that he gambled that the Saudis would not allow the landing of foreign troops on its land, okay. They would not allow Americans or British troops on Saudi soil. And so if you occupy all of Kuwait, then there is no way for the Americans or the British to repel such an invasion unless they do an amphibious landing on Kuwait itself, which would be very heavy in terms of casualties. That's quite an assumption, man. The Saudis are like two principal to bring in foreigners like, yeah, well, I mean, there was going to be blowback if that happened. That's what that's what. And Laden says. And Laden, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they have been Laden. The reason he was set off was because he went and was like, he told Turkey been face all the head of the Saudi intelligence. Listen, I can liberate Kuwait with my Mujahideen and he was laughed out of the fucking room. So yeah, I mean, there was going to be a lot of blowback, but that comes later. But it was, I think it was an educated guess in the sense that he must have thought that Saudis were aware of the blowback and were not willing to risk it. And to an extent, he might have been right, but Turkey been a face all and Ben Darbun Sultan managed to sway King Fahed into accepting Dick Cheney's proposals of deployment. And the other gamble was that it was ideological. You know, he, he wasn't going to lose face like he did against Iran because whatever you could say at the end of the day, the truth is Iraq did not win the Iran Iraq war. It might not lost openly, but it did not win. It was sad as quote. And eight years of just losing men in the material and a shambalic economy over nothing, he needed a win. He needed a win for his constituency. He needed to look good in front of his constituency. And so I think in his mind, he was going to take occupy all of Kuwait and then maybe, suppose the withdrawal on the conditional withdrawal on negotiations. But, you know, I guess he has underestimated a W bush stubbornness. Well, at the very least he could have expected a little debt relief. Like, hey, I just took over your country. You want to, you know, give me a break on that debt you've been trying to collect. Yeah, I mean, that backfire spectacularly because after the war, Iraq ended up having to pay reparations to Kuwait for the six month occupation that during a 54 billion dollars, the last installment of which was paid in late 2020. Wow. You know, you, you try your best. You win some, you win some, you win some, you win some exactly. Strikes and gutters. Yeah. Okay. All right. Yeah. I'm not happy. No, I think we can wrap this up. Thanks again. You know, we might want to do a part two at some point because there's so much else. I mean, the guy, the whole insanity of the, it's kind of a template for all future wars with the, you know, with the fake babies in the incubators. Yeah, which never happened. It would never happen. And yeah, again, I want to put this on record. Everyone I talked to said it's happened to someone who knows someone who knows someone who talked to them. Not a single one of them. I'm sorry to be cleared or audience here. Everyone you talked to who was lived in Kuwait during the occupation said they knew someone who knew someone who knew someone who knew someone who knew that babies were thrown out of incubators. Gone to their head. They'll tell you it happened. But I could not find a single person. And for the life of me, I tried who can tell me upfront ice either. I saw it happen or be. I know a family that that happened to their baby died like that. I could not find a single person. And there were investigations into it too by people thinking they were going to find it and realizing holy shit. This was fake. But anyways, that's that that would be for another episode of we do the whole war the American, you know, led war to expel Iraq from Kuwait. But this was also great. So thank you so much, Um, or again for another great episode. Thank you for having me. Yeah, thanks again, everyone for a good month and happy seventh anniversary to us. Yeah, yeah, okay. All right. Okay. Bye bye. Bye. Bye. Yeah.",
