    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. The day today is March 28, 2023 and this is episode 372. I'm the coast, Mark Ames and you're listening to Radio Warner at patreon.com-flash-radio-warnert where you can subscribe, support the show, get newsletters and so on. Anyway, I'm on the line with John Dolan, aka Gary Brecher, aka the Warnert himself. John, how's it going? Okay, yeah, I've finally had a, you know, I'm not in pain as much anymore from the stamp tooth, so I've been able to get around Glasgow and it's been really illuminating. When I met up with a bunch of RWN fans a few weeks ago, they talked about the battle of George Square. In fact, to do a Thomas Friedman, the taxi drivers talk about the battle of George Square. And it's, most people seem rather pleased with it. Basically, it was in 1919 the, there was a general strike in Glasgow, which was at that time a really big industrial city. And as everyone says, this is like the one fact that everyone remembers about this. Churchill put up machine guns in George Square, which was the... That's so Churchill. Yeah, that's Churchill. There could be a sitcom called That's So Churchill. Yeah. So I finally walked down to George Square. It's a nice square. But the main impression you get is that this city and Scotland in general had a very impressive 19th century, because it's like, there's Robbie Burns, there's Walter Scott, there's, I don't know, all these other Scottish heroes. And you move away from that square and the statues diminish. But this was clearly the, kind of the intellectual center of Britain in the 18th century, and to a large extent in the 19th century as well. The general strike in 1919, though, didn't... It wasn't as bloody as Churchill probably wanted it to be. There were only a couple of deaths. I think one cop died a couple of weeks after getting a brick thrown at him. But there was a general strike in Liverpool at the same time where there were a lot of deaths. In that sense, Liverpool was always a more disposable part of the UK than Glasgow. The empire depended heavily on the loyalty of at least the middle class of Glasgow. Liverpool was a very Irish in the centre of slave trade too, right? Yeah. Liverpool was... I mean, it still gets that kind of treatment. I mean, there was a big scandal when a football crowd stampeded because they'd been pushed into a small corner with a fence. It was 1989. The Hillsboro disaster. But yeah, there were 97 dead. And the worst of it was, I think, for Liverpool people, is that all the, well, not all the tabloids, but some major tabloids said it was their own fault. Because most of the people who died were from Liverpool and just read it out here, right? Yeah. And they were dumb yobbs, they were drunk. That's why it happened. And it turned out that was wrong. They were just ordinary football fans and they got pushed into a hopeless corner and they died. The sun, for example, had a story called The Truth. Some fans picked pockets of victims. Some fans urinated on the brave cops. The brave cops. Some fans beat up a constable giving the kiss of life. Wow. So yeah, Liverpool is like the red-headed stepchild of the, not coincidentally, red-headed stepchild of the proverb, getting much the worst beatings. But yeah, Scott, the good thing about Glasgow is that it's very proud of standing up to Churchill in the 1919 industrial problems. And the great part was Churchill supposedly wanted to bring in troops, but he was told by people who knew Glasgow. No, there's a Scottish regiment, at least one in Glasgow. And if you send in English regiments, they will march against you. And you'll be glad he didn't do it. Why did they stop them? I know. I mean, I'm just surprised he didn't want to use poison gas right away. Because that's the most Churchill thing imaginable. Yeah. Well, I guess it wouldn't have been politics called them primitive tribes. He said, poison gas was best against primitive tribes, meaning the Kurds in that case. You know, he also used him in Russia in the Civil War when the Brits came in on the side of the whites in the Civil War. He did? He was a little known. Yeah. He used poison gas and actually opened up the first concentration camps, where they kept Russian soldiers, you know, in some of the red... Well, that was the red army guys. ...like this is a good idea. We're gonna give him this someday. Take a sneak in a piece of paper and take notes. Draw a map of this thing. Yeah. Well, there's the Boer War thing, but... I know. I know. I'm just saying, yeah, he had that reputation already. But God, good for Scotland then, you know? Yeah. I know. Yeah. In general, I like Glasgow a lot. I mean, the weather's pretty amazing. I mean, I'm too old for this weather. You know, if I was young, I'd still have that wall of Stevens attitude. Cold is good. Yeah. It's bad, but I'm way too old for that now. The cold gets to your bones much more easily now. Yeah. The clothes don't do as good a job as they used to. No. Look at me in my overcoat with the collar out, you know? Yeah. Looking serious. I sometimes feel like the pilot light has gone out. You know, somebody, you know, just take a lighter back there and see him. But, yeah, I think most mornings, it's like three or four degrees. It's supposed to get warmer in a couple of days. But if, you know, if you stay indoors, it's okay. Sounds like it could be even chillier than in Rochester, where I am. I don't know. Yeah. I think the spring comes late because it's a very marine climate. Yes, that's the difference to marine climate. So Iraq, I mean, we can't let the month end before getting in our last shots about this for now, the Iraq war. You know, it's kind of surprising. I think there's actually been fewer retrospectives on the 20th anniversary. So almost like the people who've been, the people who've been on this, on just, you know, trying to remind people of the horror that was the Iraq war and how much it's still present in our, in our elite political intellectual DNA, you know, media, DNA. I think, I think they feel like have defeated because it hasn't, I don't know, it hasn't led to anything. And it is very frustrating in that way. It nobody paid. I mean, we've said this before and you just got to say it again. Nobody paid no matter how many times you remind up. It just, you know, I would just say this. I mean, it just, it does help in some small degree at the very least to always remind people of this and who was doing this. It does help. And even if they don't collapse, I mean, John, you know, we've talked about this a lot too. Like, there was this, what should have collapsed is the idea, which was very strong and very hard to disabuse oneself of. That if you prove somebody wrong, prove somebody important lied, you show them up as hypocrites. That it will have some kind of magical effect of changing things. And I think by this point, we understand that it doesn't, you know, and so we kind of have to rethink what the whole kind of structure of like of the relationship between, I don't know, media policy. The elite layer to the rest of the country is like and just our myths that we've had about accountability and. Yeah, well, I think hypocrisy shaming as people have said, isn't that effective? And I've been trying to think about why and I remember what someone who was writing, I think, for the Christian post said in response to a question about some. Some pastor who'd been caught doing something sleazy and the response was, well, that doesn't matter. Christian values or Christian values. And the fact that person A or person B or person X didn't live up to them has no effect because the values are not incarnated permanently in one person. And it can only exist as a sort of ideal and you can shoot down any number of people who claim to exemplify them, but the belief in them won't be affected at all. I mean, I remember thinking, ah, that's a scary story. And if you proved like half of the people who were claiming those virtues were bad people, that wouldn't affect it. But yeah, I kind of think not. If you, if you have American nationalism or American exceptionalism as a key value, you can probably live through any number of hypocrisy revelations. And it's worse than that because preachers who were caught with their pants down or snorting coke on, you know, with their gay prostitutes, I mean, they actually, they're, their business is suffered, their reputation suffered. And the media people, not only not, but they all advanced. They're the only ones that advanced. So it's almost like something else is going on as well. I mean, yeah, but calling it just to, calling out hypocrisy though is, I mean, the weakness of it is it kind of merely is calling out like a moral failing. This is kind of more worse than a moral failing. And on so many levels. It was definitely an intellectual. And for me, at least, this is something else I wanted to say. Like, it was an aesthetic failing. I mean, maybe this is just a very snotty Berkeley response, but I was reading when we were preparing for the show, I was reading Maureen Dowd's article on Bush's mission accomplished speech. And it was all framed in terms of like top gun. And it was, it was supposed to be sexy or something. I don't know. And the idea that you would quote top gun, make Bush into the Tom Cruise character and make it all seem sexy and exciting. That was just very embarrassing. And I realized that there was a gap of sensibility between me and. And many of the people who had previously seen themselves as liberal because they bought into a lot of this. I love a man in a uniform thing. Yeah. And I remember it was Rob Reiner who made that movie a few good men, which for me was a big gap opening point. Like, if that's your idea of a nationalist military movie, then you guys are crazy. And I'm getting off. And lame. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I was to put it a bit lame. Yeah. And anyway, we'll get into something because it, like I said, just because it didn't have the effect one would want, it doesn't mean you then give up or stop talking about it. You got to keep, you know, throwing rocks at that castle anyway. One of those rocks might bump one of them in the head one of these times. And it annoys them at the very least. I know it annoys them being called out. They hate it. And it doesn't affect them, but they I'm sure it annoys the hell out of them. They want us all to forget. So we shouldn't forget. But yeah, it's that again, the lack of the the the earnest kind of major premise that a lot of people, I mean, and myself to some degree, but others to a much bigger degree, kind of carrying to this. And it's like, I remember I reviewed this book for the New York press back in the 2000s. It was called the record of the paper by Howard Friel and Richard Falk. What's the subtitle? How The New York Times, Miss reports, US Foreign Policy actually found an old copy here. And so I did a review on it. And it was like, everything the book was right. But except for their therefore assumptions, like basically the main case that the book makes is that the New York Times, being the most influential newspaper, is not adhering to international law on its editorial stances for the Coast of a war. And, well, I mean, it kind of brought things back to Vietnam and, you know, and Nicaragua reporting, but it really focused on the Iraq war and the Coast of war. And the idea is if they had followed what is international law and sort of base their arguments on the on the kind of moral certainty and legal certainty of international law, they would not have made these mistakes. And they would have done things differently. And then we wouldn't have had these wars. See where the therefore get really weird. Like, first of all, they're not going to follow international law. If the political and intellectual elites are not following it, they're not going to either their whole job is to come up with all kinds of rationalizations. And what are they going to punish themselves? I mean, it's the idea that like we can scold you and you will change your behavior. And it really, it goes back and it raises a question like, I think a lot of the reason why people believe this will and should happen when you're called out for lying and failing, there should be consequences. Because there were some cultural consequences in the semines for getting Vietnam wrong and getting some of the worst kind of like excesses of the empire wrong. A lot of those people seem to get moved up, but it only you know, then we had Reagan a few years later. So like, well, when you consider the difference in the way centrist liberals think about Trump and George W. Bush now, it becomes clear that for them, Trump is as condemned as he would be for a Calvinist minister. And he is bound to hell. That that is his eternal destiny. Whereas Bush in their weird, weird minds has become somebody who can be redeemed because he wanders around being nice and showing up at presidential pancake breakfast, you know, and helping to make eggs for people. And he does it with an idiot grin on his face. So there's something about what does and what doesn't get you out of the club forever. Yeah. Something about crudeness norms. I mean, that's the thing they kept talking about norms. And yeah, norms, it's everything else, league, you know, international law and all this other stuff. Bullshit, it's norms, it's norms because I guess if you look at it again, if you or I were in the ruling class, like in the heart of the ruling class, really powerful, sensing that power, you know, like children of nepotistic, you know, wealth and power. But it would the rest of the country, they had a 330 million people who aren't part of my group. It would be kind of scary. It would be kind of like, how do you keep them enthralled? And it's sort of by the magic of the office and the magic of the, quote unquote, dignity of the office. So that's I think that was the thing that Trump is really so deeply. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cause he had no dignity and they love that. They love that. I mean, I think a lot, a lot of people who are maybe if you like on the left, loved it in a different way too. I admit, there are moments when Trump violated decorum that I was sort of chuckling. Yeah. I think because we all wanted to sensible people were chuckling at certain points. Yeah. We were holding hands across the aisle in one big circle. Even though we hated each other. And it's funny, but that I've been thinking of Russian literature before the revolution. There's a lot of that deep fear of what the provinces are thinking and what's going on in their their heads. Like Sologu, the silver dove where there's, there's secret cults being developed and who knows what they're going to do. And there's a, there's a poem, I think, can't remember who did it. Well, in the sense, Dusty Epski's serfs who get these, I'm right, these kind of serfs who get these like bad ideas, you know, is they start thinking for themselves outside orthodoxy and kind of the hierarchy of things they become extremely dangerous. Yeah. There's this poem that I can't remember the author now, but it's, I don't know, like Piotr Ivanovich, shares that a tree and sees a peasant shaking his fist at him in the tree. He looks again and there is no peasant in the tree. He looks back and there's the peasant again shaking his fist at him. And they, they were having this, this feeling like, am I hallucinating this or something scary up there. And in the long run, they, it may not have been that scary. They managed to bring it on themselves in the most insane possible way by wars of choice. Yes. Because I think it's safe to say that France would not have bled out just to help its ally, Russia, in the way that Russia bled out to help France. But, you know, that was, that was no bless oblige as they saw it. So, yeah, there's, there's this fear that the common people don't react the way we and the elite do. And they can't be predicted. They seem very nice, but don't pat them, you know, just enjoy them from across the way. I sometimes felt like I'm sure this isn't true, but, you know, the first place where I felt like I really saw a total unaccountability was Russia in the 90s. I mean, just, you know, gargantuan theft and degradation of everything and corruption and even getting caught out never led to any consequences globally or otherwise because they were with the right team team Washington DC, team Clinton. And the Clinton people running that had, you know, nobody paid for that giant failure. And I sometimes felt like a lot of people sort of learned at some point, well, if we square everything up, like, who's going to make us be held accountable? Like, what am I going to, why would I hold myself accountable or somebody, you know, who works with me, why would I hold them accountable when I'm also guilty of 10 different things? Because that's how I got here. Like, why would we hold each other accountable when we can just sort of utter some homilies about accountability and move on and talk about how I passed this. And, you know, as long as the money is in a hard currency and it's offshore. Yeah. There, there's not going to be any accountability, which I gather is happening in the US elite too. There's, there are a lot of grumbles from voices among the great unwashed that, you know, Hillary's and Trump's grandchildren are all learning Mandarin and they all go to the same schools and keep their money in the same places. I don't know, but it's if I remember the American elite, I would be tempted at least to put a side bet on collapse. Yeah, they're funny too. They can't help themselves. I mean, again, we'll get back to Iraq, but, you know, again, I just, it's so amazing that the Biden administration, the Biden presidency has gone, you know, as, you know, as poorly as we sort of, we thought it would. It's, it started off surprising, but it was hard to believe it was going to go that way. And basically that faction of the ruling class sort of thought, wow, something's really broken here because how else would Trump come into power and Hillary lose. We really need to do some big things to woo people back. I guess we've made mistakes. You know, there's not any accountability. There haven't, there's been nothing but austerity for all these years, people of several. We really need to change things, make impact people's lives like noticeably better. We got to offer all these things and yet such a huge grand program. And literally within three, four months after he took office, it was like, we can't do that. And we should, because we're going to have to raise taxes on the people who backed it. They're like, you know, we don't need that anymore. And they just dropped the whole thing. And it's like, now we actually don't need that anymore. And Trump, Trump, maybe that was just a one off. And we got it contained. And anyway, you know, who wants to have their taxes raised? I mean, this actually leads back rather easily to the question of media response to the Iraq war because we, we talked a little bit about Bill Keller, who was the editor of the New York Times in the lead up to the war. And I was just looking at his wiki page. He's the son of a chairman of general motors. I couldn't believe it. As Walter, I think as you quoted Walter, saying, you know, these rich fox, they're all these, I mean, it's so true, man, everything. Especially in the media. I swear to God, there's more nepotism in the media than any other profession. I can imagine. Yeah, like poets, for example, were even in my day, I was just real stupid. Either they had a trust fund or they were stupid because there's no income. And I saw an interview with someone, sort of one of these grizzled old guys of the media getting asked, what would you tell a young person trying to go into journalism today? I don't know if they had a trust fund. Yes, yes, if they don't, they're not going to be able to make a living. So yeah, I can imagine that the media now does select for people who already got that trust fund. Yeah. But here's what here's, here's a quote from Bill Keller, who greets the skids for Judith Miller and her co-writer Gordon. In the lying lead up to the Iraq war. And the smugness and calmness of it is really frightening. We reluctant hawks made disagree among ourselves about the most compelling logic for war, protecting America, relieving oppressed Iraqis, or reforming the Middle East. But we generally agree that the logic for standing pat does not hold. This is the old, it's better to do something. Yeah. Do something is as we've said, always wrong. Much as we might wish the administration had orchestrated events so the inspectors had a year instead of three months, much as we just plow the arrogance and binary moralism. That's as if, oh, you know, bush in those people, they have to talk about good and evil to the simple folk. We are above this, but they need such consolations. Anyway, we deploy the arrogance and binary moralism. Yeah, but this is decorum again, right? So that's, yeah, what matters to these people? Yeah. And it fits in with norms. Yes. There is a norm for us. And there is a somewhat looser norm for the ordinary people. But he finishes by saying, much as we worry about all the things that could go wrong, we are hard pressed to see an alternative that is not built on wishful thinking. And the extraordinary thing about this is that they continually invoke wishful thinking as if the peace advocates were guilty of wishful thinking because they underestimated the danger of Saddam Hussein's regime. That was exactly wrong. Saddam Hussein's regime collapsed within three weeks. And when he was finally found, he was hiding in a spider hole with no phone, no communications of any kind. He couldn't have run a neighborhood paper route from that place. But what these people did not think about because of their own wishful thinking was the possibility of guerrilla war. I mean, that's been intellectually the most striking thing when you go back to elite reactions or anticipation rather of the Iraq war. Nobody in that group was thinking about guerrilla warfare after an occupation. It's astounding. I mean, because people were thinking about it. Just not them. No, that's a really good point. The one thing when they thought of a potential downside, they thought it could spark some kind of regional war. But that didn't really sound as scary in a way, right? Because it's like, okay, then we'll have set peace wars where we can defeat other even smaller set peace armies. I mean, when you say you're going to get caught in a guerrilla war and a protracted ugly guerrilla war, nobody wants to be involved in that. There's nothing, there's nothing. I mean, everybody know it just means a, you know, incredible violence, no glory, no sort of resolution. And nothing really resolved. Like you basically just have to kill everybody. And here's, here's from George Packer, big, big figure in this. He's a, he's a big promoter of the, sort of the, the moral imperative to support Ukraine. And today he wrote these big pieces for the Atlantic on how like all of our civilizational aspirations and all of our Western morality are embodied in Ukraine. I mean, he doesn't really change his stick ever. But anyway, here's the liberal quandary over Iraq in the New York Times magazine 2002. And he, he tries to boil down what the, what the sort of pro war versus anti war arguments are among liberals. And yeah, against war one containment work for 10 years to we shouldn't start wars with that immediate provocation and international support three we could inflict terrible casualties. And so could Saddam for a regional war could break out anti-Americanism could get worse. Five democracy can't be imposed six Bush's political aims unknown seven America's will and capacity for nation building are too limited eight war and a rack will distract from the war on terrorism and swell. Al Qaeda's ranks well a lot of those, those against wars were ripe at nowhere. Does he say guerrilla war? No, you know, yeah, it kind of dances around it like, you know, Bush's aims are unknown is reminiscent of the remark attributed to Patreas like it's patreas, supposedly said to a reporter on the ground in Iraq in the early days. You tell me how this ends right because there was no clear ending for it, which we cause Vietnam right when you talk like that it recalls Vietnam right. Yeah, but nobody was much worried about that because I think they were, they were kind of crazy in love. I think this is something we kind of have to talk about they were all of this was and I'm not one of these Freudian, you know, people, but all of this was really sexualized in a weird way. I just want to read some of a Maureen Dowd column in the New York Times from May 4, 2003 just after Bush did his incredibly cheesy landing on that aircraft carrier. And this is this is where intellectual limitations and sensibility problems merge for me because first of all, if you thought top gun was a good model to imitate. I mean, if you wanted to go to war in that era as people out of blade runner, okay, I might have been sensitive, I might have fallen for that. But top gun, no. But anyway, here's what she says, the tale who caught the last cable jerking the fighter jet from 150 miles per hour to zero in two seconds outbounded the cocky rule breaking daredevil flyboy. Now you cannot no one on earth can can string together a set of epithets like this the cocky rule breaking daredevil flyboy just reminds me of a simple episode where where Lisa is sort of crushing on the salon adolescent who works at the library part time. And she says if only someone could tame him. So daredevil flyboy a man navigating the highway to the danger zone out along the edges where he was born to be. The further on the edge, the hotter the intensity, it almost rhymes at the end. I mean, God help us. That's marine dad. That's the New York Times. And she finishes this time Maverick didn't just nail a few, a few bogies and do a 4G invented dive with a mig 28 at a range of two meters. This time the top gun capital T capital G wasted a couple of nasty regimes and promised this was just the beginning. I mean, it reminds me of that moment where our Kindle got stolen on a bus in Albania and somebody used it to buy his painful to it. And a romance novel that was called sealed with a kiss about falling in love with a Navy seal. I actually tried. I figured, okay, this is probably good for the show. I'll remember. But it got too sad. But at the meantime, I read a couple of pages of it. It was like this. This is marine dad. New York Times. My God, that's funny. Oh boy. Yeah, we're doomed. It was, yeah, it was, it was bad. There was that love affair. There was, I think you're absolutely right that sense among liberals. You see this in a lot of old accounts actually in Packers account and in Packers account of different liberals. They're all basically they're trying to ask themselves or openly ask like, you know, we can get, but we can like Bush listened to us because we can make this war better. We can make this more like Michael McFaul all of a lot of his pro Iraq invasion stuff was sort of like Bush's only problem is he needs to be more explicit about democracy promotion. He needs to listen to the liberal internationalists so that like we can be partners, you know, and we can make you better. You need us, you know, just please say you do need us because we're here ready to help. And they were kind of falling all over themselves to prove that they weren't afraid of war, but they were afraid of was doing it wrong in some way, but which meant like not doing it according to their norms, according to liberal norms, which would be like basically putting a human humanitarian gloss on the whole thing. That's why I think when you said decor slash decorum. Yeah, I think that's a very good image for for this like yeah, this war has good bones, but you got to let us, you know, do the makeup. Yeah. But I mean, it all seemed the worst is it all seemed to work out for them and God was their gloating God was their gloating because American troops entered Baghdad on April 9th, the war began March 20th, 2003. And by April 9th, they were inside Baghdad and they staged that toppling of the statue of Saddam in 52 square. So the outpouring, I'm sure you remember it Mark, the outpouring of shut up you on patriotic, you know, they were, uh, naysayers. Yeah, I think the word naysayers actually got got used by somebody famous because, um, now, now it's all done. I mean, Bush has landed on the carrier and said mission accomplished giant banner saying mission accomplished. Cheesy as hell, but they didn't mind cheesyness. And now we have actually taken Baghdad and we have done what had become by that time. I kind of magic right, which was the toppling of the dictator's statue. I mean, you'd seen this in so many wars before that I think many people thought it would have a magical power. I personally think magic is much more popular than it is admitted to be. And I thought, I think people really believe that once you pull down that statue of Saddam, uh, that would be it. In fact, I got to be honest here. Um, I think I visited the, the statue garden in Moscow with you guys. And when I saw the statue of Zerzhinsky, I, I was scared of that thing. I mean, I didn't like that thing. Um, so I kind of buy into this myself. Um, but they're what, what they were not afraid of once again. And this is astonishing. Well, they were not afraid of its guerrilla war. And it started fast. Yeah. Uh, it started what within a couple months. Yep. Just before we get to that, uh, I do want to say before we get to the guerrilla war, uh, I just want to sort of put a cap on the bill Keller part here because you were quoting from, uh, this infamous bill Keller article. This is from this is a month before the invasion, February 2003. The I can't believe I'm a hot club. And, and what he says in here was, and this is repeated by many people in the liberal side. He says here, um, Kenneth Pollock, the Clinton National Security Council expert, who's argument for invading Iraq is surely the most influential book of this season has provided intellectual cover for every liberal who finds himself inclining towards war, but uneasy about Mr. Bush. Um, and Pollock himself, uh, wrote, and so he, he's not the only one. I mean, even like Matthew a glacius, um, who was pretty young at the time. Um, but he had said that he was sort of, um, persuaded to support the war by Paul, by Kenneth Pollock's book. And Pollock himself, I think on the eve of the invasion said basically, some like, this is our only chance to go to war on our terms. If we don't invade now, then there's no more chance left ever until Saddam drops a nuke on America period. Like the kind of argumentation. And then you fast forward, um, about three or four months later, it's June 20, 2003. Um, and here's Kenneth Pollock in the New York Times opinion section headline, Saddam's bombs will find them. And I swear they got yeah, and where are racks, rapids of mass destruction. It's a good question. And unfortunately, we don't yet have a good answer. Uh, uh, it means I'm accusations are mounting that the Bush administration made up the whole Iraqi weapons threat to justify an invasion. That is just not the case. Not that not so. And then one month after that Bill Keller gets bumped up to executive editor of the New York Times. I mean, yeah, I, I know it, it's probably goch to, to cite the onion in a praising way, but, uh, I, I got a, I mean, the onion has done some great. Yes. And this 20 years later, the best description of the discourse on the eve of this war was, uh, I mean, I know it's probably ghost to, to cite the onion in a praising way. And so, the reason why this war was, uh, two talking heads, uh, on the printed page, one on the left saying, well, no, if we invade Iraq, that will stir up civil war between Kurds, shea and Sunni, uh, it will destabilize the whole region. Populations there that want control back if you displace them like the Iraqi Sunni, uh, you will create a situation like with, like with the posh tun in, in Afghanistan, they're used to being in control. If you take that away from them, they're going to be angry. And the counterpoint was this sort of weasley face guy saying, no, no, it won't. I know. Yeah. And that was it. Yeah. I mean, there were like Andrew Sullivan at that time, um, was a, he was among the gloters too that, you know, this proves that, you know, these places where there were protests, these people are essentially a fifth column. They're not real Americans. Of course, he's not American either. Um, and, uh, you know, we'll find, I think he had a quote, we will find the weapons of mass destruction. He's a kind of canny guy clever guy because he was one of the first heart, it write ease to turn on the right sometime in, I don't know, 2004 or five. He jumped before others did. So he kind of salvage his reputation so that he could go on and, uh, promote race intelligence. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, you racial eugenics. Oh, isn't that nice. Um, but anyway, yeah. So yeah. I mean, the casualties of this media war were never the people who pushed for war that because they, with very few exceptions, prospered no matter how wrong they'd been. The casualties were people like David Kelly, the UK, chemical weapons expert because he wrote a report saying the WMD threat had been quote, sexed up, which is an interesting phrase, by the way, considering, um, there really was a lot of sexiness. Yes. I mean, remember, this was a time when people thought the show home improvement was kind of sexy in a domestic way. So anything is possible. Um, he, uh, got stitched up by the UK tabloids who can hound someone to their death. I mean, the Olympian gods, gadflies were nothing compared to the tabloids. I think I actually talked to someone whose brother had been a tabloid target for one day. He was considered a love rat. And it was on the pages of all the tabloids like the Daily Mail and the Sun and stuff. And he said his brother was, you know, just like Sylvester the cat when he walks into the room with the kangaroo in it walks back out. Why does it go. He was never the same. So this guy got tabloid and he was a scientist, a steamious kind of polite shy person. And he walked into a neighboring wood. He cut his wrist with a pruning shear, uh, except there were maybe, well, and took a bunch of pills and died. So it was either suicide or something else. But there were a lot of casualties like that because when you go against the group's decision. And the group that mattered had already decided. It's really unpleasant. It's remarkably unpleasant. Yeah. You can die of it. Yeah. Do you want to talk about some of the other people who are pushing for the war at this time? Or do you want to? Yeah. Let's just quote some of these people here who were supporting the war when it counted. When speaking, you know, these are the same people that pontificate endlessly about freedom and, you know, freedom of conscience and all this stuff. Like you could have actually spoke up once and maybe in your own tiny way, maybe, maybe, maybe put a little stick in the spoke of the machine as it was, you know, lurching towards war, but you didn't. So here's again, New Yorker editor David Remnik. He wrote, you know, his case for war, his case for invasion January 26, 2003. He got bumped up to editor in chief of the New Yorker after getting Russia completely wrong in the 90s. You know, we talked about him in our series on Yeltsin's bombing of the democratically elected Russian parliament in 1993 and Remnik supported Yeltsin's coup against the parliament saying, you can't make an omelike without breaking some eggs. And he had claimed that in 1997, Russia had this great future. It could never go back, you know, next year, Russia collapsed here after that, Putin took over. Anyway, here he is in 2003. The United States has been wrong politically and morally about Iraq more than once in the past. Washington supported Saddam against Iran and overlooked some overlooked some of his bloodiest adventures overlooked. We were literally like via satellite. Yes, exactly. Pointing, the price of being wrong yet again could be incalculable. So it's like, we were wrong in the past. Nothing bad happened to us as far as I know. And then we, but the price of being wrong yet again could be incalculable could be could be. This is that whole 1% doctrine. History will not easily excuse us if by, but actually history will so long as you're wrong with the right crowd while history, who's history? History is you and your buddies. History will not easily excuse us if by deciding not to decide. We defer a reckoning with an aggressive totalitarian leader who intends not only to develop weapons of mass destruction, but also to use them. I don't know where you get that from. Saddam's abdication or military coup would be a godsend. His sudden conversion to the wisdom of disarmament almost as good. He actually did disarm thinking. I think it's worth mentioning this especially for people who are too young to have lived through this. All these people say. And if there's a hell they will go to the go to it for saying this. I would love it if Saddam abdicated or gave up his weapons. And you can tell their thing. Oh God, please don't let Saddam abdicate or give up his weapons. Come on, come on Saddam. Give us some repissom off more than the weapons inspector saying we can't find anything. You know, they got blue balls like they're just screaming for this war. Most ridiculous thing. It is a fine thing to dream God, that effective tone it is a fine, passive stream. Padding you on the head for your simplistic belief that this war is a bad idea. But assuming such dreams are not realized, a return to a hollow pursuit of containment will be the most dangerous option of all. Contained with the world. I mean, dangerous of all. It's so strange because these are the people who are mouthing childish simplistic cliches. The ones who were the few who were, well, not few. The ones who were opposing the war were saying, look, Iraq is a compound of three people who have historically gotten along pretty badly. It's been under the control of one of those groups for a long time. If you dethrone that group, you're going to destabilize the place. And that group, the people of the Sunni triangle, as it was called at the time, are not going to take it very kindly. That was a real point. The level of abstraction in this is like a million times higher, a million times more childish than simplistic than what the critics of the war were saying. You know what's interesting, actually, it shows that the mentality of, so people talk a lot today, by some included, about sort of online brain, right, where your whole world view is formed by your fights or tribal sort of, you know, spats with other online people. And then you think that's reality. And that's exactly what he's doing here. Like he's not even, for Remnik, his reality is not what's happening in Iraq, what a war there would be like, what forces it could unleash. That's not his argument. His world, his opponent in his mind are other New York liberals who aren't full war. Yeah, absolutely. That's it. This is the only battle right there. Is that one too? It's very online before you're having online fight. And I think the New York thing is really important in this too. I mean, that's been a shock to me just reading this over. It's like the only people who were allowed to talk in this argument on TV and in the media, the print media, as it was at that time still, are overwhelmingly based in New York. They talk to each other. They don't really believe in anybody else. And yeah, so the literary editor of the New Republic, Leon Weiseltier, I think, he has an even more exaggerated version of this because he was mainly a literary guy. And Iraq probably wasn't real to him in the first place. So in his argument, as you said, it is literally all about the United States. He said in March 2003, so can a liberal support this president in this war? I do not see why not. Nobody has ever said, I do not see why not. Just say, I don't see why not. I do not see why not. The United States, its needs and its duties is larger than any of its leaders. The war against Saddam Hussein is just and it is truly a last resort. Well, first of all, just wars always win. Just wars are a good idea. I mean, there are a lot of peoples of the North American continent had a just war against the people who are trying to steal their land. It didn't go well. But anyway, Saddam Hussein has been in violation of the Security Council for 12 years. It is in his unrestrained contempt for the United Nations and not the Bush administrations. Restrained contempt for the United Nations. I don't I I I I I I I I I I that may destroy the institution. There were some Republicans who despised Bill Clinton as much as some Democrats despised George W. Bush. But they supported the American interventions in Bosnia and Kosovo. And therefore they rose above politics to history above sectarianism to Americanism. This is one of those things. Like John Williams musicals for an again. Yeah, I cannot imagine any strenuous construction of liberalism that does not include the injunction to fight terror and to fight genocide. Liberal is not a false liberalism is not a philosophy of innocence. And it should make tyrants quake not smile. It's as if you know you should say at the end of this. And when we come down out of the metaphors, what happens? You know, what happened? What happens there? I mean, it's also in theory it's supposed to be very enlightened. It's supposed to not be stupid. I don't know. That seems pretty basic among everything else in that list there. I don't think tyrants smile at liberals. They hate them, I think, as a general rule or whatever. But you're not supposed to be stupid. I don't know what else. God, these people. No, it sounds like small town clergy. There's a lot of that. There is a lot of that. Yes, a lot of that. Gotta say there was a lot of that pushing for intervention in Kosovo too. Yeah. From either a broader spectrum of liberals. Yeah, but that's a really interesting point because underneath all that moralizing was a sense that we're picking on Serbia here. And Serbia is worn out demoralized. It's a tiny birth rate, not many soldiers. Most people are sick of this nationalist shit that Milosevic was pushing. It's going to be easy. They stressed that. They stressed the moral stuff. But underneath that was a calculation that made a kind of grim sense. There was no calculation this time. Yeah, I mean, Serbia or the former Yugoslavian Serbia was surrounded by countries that were not friendly to it. And were not a threat to NATO or the US or anything. They weren't going to be fed by people rushing in from Romania and Hungary and Austria to fight on the side of Serbia against NATO or something. So, yeah, it was definitely very different. Yeah, so Packer has this has this big article, the liberal quandary over Iraq. He says stuff like you can find America's new anti-war movement in a bright yellow room. Four floors above the traffic of West 57th Street. A room so small that it's occupant burns himself on the heat pipe when he turns over and bet. I mean, he spends a lot of time mocking anti-war. Basically saying, yeah, in liberals were anti-war. We've talked about this John. That was a blip in time, though. They're really not so anti-war, but the reputation that they acquired for themselves from the 1970s really outlived actual liberalism. And he actually calls, he says, this anti-war movement has a serious liability. One that was just about guarantee its impotence. It's controlled by the furthest reaches of the American left because they voice unnew on slogans like no sanctions, no bombing or no blood for oil. As for what should be done to keep this mass murder and his weapons in check, they have nothing to say at all. Actually, but they had sanctions and already weapons inspectors. What he means is, as for what should be done, basically, as for war, they don't want to go to war. That's all he means. This is not a constructive liberal anti-war movement because it's anti-war. And just sort of moving forward, I just want to read a little bit of, so he later apologized or kind of did a mehikopa. One of the ones about, let's see, in November 2001. But it's not really a lot of these guys mehikopas were not really mehikopas at all. His, he says, it is easy and completely justified to blame certain individuals. It's always easy. That's very easy, but you try actually lying for war. Now that's hard. I went out there, man. You know, $10 a word in the New York Times magazine and lied for a war. You try doing that. It is easy and completely justified to blame certain individuals for the erect tragedy. I'm sorry, but I'm remembering, I'm just imagining, rather, Jack Nicholson and I, a new version of a few good men. I mean, you can't handle the lies. You're not strong enough to take the lies and give them out every day for $10 a word in New Yorker. Yeah, but over the years, I've become more concerned with the failures that went beyond individuals. And what is an individual anyway? And beyond Iraq, and what is Iraq? What is Earth? Concerned with the growing arteriosklerosis of American institutions. That's caused by the war you supported, you idiot. Iraq was the last. You guys could always mass resign or jump off a cliff. Exactly. I know and clear up those arteries. Yeah. But they stayed there and blocked it. So here's, here he is. I just want to show him today. Right. So here he is in the Atlantic. I think it was, I don't know, sometimes in the last few months, something the last year, for sure. Last few months. Yeah, last October. So about six months ago. The headline is, Ukrainians are defending the values Americans claim to hold. You cannot just remain silent. You cannot remain still. You have to do something. There it is again. The do something is him, right? In the days before my trip, I had a feeling of nausea that I recognized as dread. Not of the place I was going, but of the place I was leaving behind. Of the, of the Let's Go brand insides and the school board show. I got to say that I think of all the lame dumbass things the right does all the time. The Let's Go brand and think I have a soft spot for that one. I like that one. Well, if it's, if it's origin story is true, then it is kind of brilliant. Like supposedly a crowd at a stock car race was shouting fuck Joe Biden. And the announcer, not probably out of Biden loyalty, but because he was such a media flincher that he couldn't bear the thought of that going out on air said, and the crowd is shouting, let's go Brandon. I didn't even know that. That makes it even better. And it's not even particularly disparaging to Biden. Yeah. It's just funny. It's funny that people get worked up over. That's the, that's the most funny thing that people like George Packer want to leave America because people say let's go Brandon. That is the funny thing. Of the Let's Go brand and sides, the school board showdowns and the next mass shooting, the prospect that our experiment and people coming from all over to run their own affairs together was finished because they say let's go Brandon. For the first time in my life, I felt hopeless about America. That's how I felt when you fuckers got us into the Iraq war and kept your jobs. Anyway, and because I have no transcendent beliefs, the loss of this earthly one left a void of meaning that made me sick. You see how important this kind of like secular, small town clergyism is to the elite, the real like blue state blue check elites. It's very weird. Man, I'm telling you NPR also runs the most tear jerker mockish segments every day. They love their sentimentality. It's just scary people. America has to have a mission. One of the things that people don't seem to understand is that there were two religions in civil war America. Well, there was also Catholicism, Judaism in the pockets of the margins. But really the two big religions were the northern congregationalist New England religion and the southern, roughly evangelical, baptist religion. And they had really different views and they evolved differently. In the south, because of defeat among other things, religion petrified and became an unassailable fortress for the white south. But in the north religion melted and suffused into a kind of secular notion of charity, which I'm using in a non-normative sense on a kind of, it isn't often very pleasant. And that's the religion that in a secularized form, this guy is talking about. And it means, in effect, unless America imagined as me and my Manhattan friends who have dinner at each other's places, if we don't have some place to mess with in the world, just like sending bibles to the kitties or defusing the pirates or whatever, if we don't have a messianic purpose secularized but still essentially Christian, then we're nothing. We're just a bunch of rich people. Just a bunch of rich, powerful people from rich, powerful families who got placed in these jobs. I got to continue on this just a little more. Here was another motive for him going out there. And I just wanted to say, Ukraine has had and has every damn right to defend itself from an invasion. That's separate. What's scary and has always been scary and has increasingly made myself and a lot of people I know, really, really wary of this war, is the way it's influencing and affecting our culture and the back and forth on that. And it's very dangerous. It's like insane. Here was another motive, the strongest and most dubious of all. I wanted a gulp of Ukrainian air. I wanted to breathe its hope. What a thing to ask of people fighting for their lives. Isn't that just wild, man? Yeah. I'm sorry, but I must gulp your air. I wonder how it would grow in a group of Ukrainians. I can just see a bunch of people waiting for the bus in the slush. What are you talking about? Are you translating that for real? At the moment, you know, to the Ukrainians credit, they generally all been... Well, a lot of them, I mean, there's also been a lot of media discipline, but they've been pretty, you know, unusual for Ukrainians or a lot of people. They've been pretty smart about... They know who's helped they need. And so they've been pretty good about, and they probably would. But my wife, the other day, showed me this funny thing going around Russian, Ukrainian and Russian telegram or something, and it shows a comparison. I'm sure it's all manipulated, but it's still like it rings true and it's pretty funny. A comparison between how this middle-aged American woman responds to a compliment versus a Russian. And so there's like this middle-aged American woman looks like kind of more working class, perhaps, is meant to be looking like that. She's out somewhere and somebody compliments her shirt, and she's like kind of very shy. I was like, oh, thank you. I really appreciate it. And then there's like this Russian woman sort of, you know, the type with layers on it's in the snow hole in the paketti walking. And somebody says, you know, this is very special. And like, it compliments her clothes and the woman as she keeps walking. And looks like, did she go, blab, pitotas, blab, sukabliad, vutan, you can be such a studa, blab, and Russians love this one. They think it's a funny, and it is very funny when you see it. Just basically like, fuck off, you fucking weirdo and, you know, worst things in that. And, you know, so... Yeah, that's what I mean. It's not that they're not fighting bravely, and it's not that they don't have the absolute right to fight. But that the idea that, you know, a very reasonable grimness about the world is going to dissipate, and they're going to listen to talk about Ukrainian air. Yes. It seems unlikely. No, it's totally fucking absurd. It's insane. And then he had another one after that. I think that piece got a lot of play, and people were like, oh my god, Packer and the whole Neocon liberal interventionist thing is really coming back in a big, big way, which is one of the... I mean, we've talked about this since the very beginning of the war of the invasion last year, that, you know, that's what's happening. But this is kind of the most extreme example. And then here's Packer, December, a couple months later, December in the Atlantic, an article called a new theory of American power. The United States can and must wield its power for good. I mean, you could just cut and paste that to 2003, 2002, 1999 for that matter. It just like zero has been learned at all. No, I think they were they they were kind of had an enforced time out period. Yes. And because the Ukraine war is in itself a just cause repelling an in bear, they think that this time no American combat troops just cause within certain limits, even granting NATO interference and such. That they can now do the same tunes with complete safety. Yeah. Because they're not claiming weapons of mass destruction. I'm sure a lot of pundits would be really glad if weapons of mass destruction were used in Ukraine. But they they're not claiming it. They're not going to have to explain the casualties in America. And the template is there. The template hasn't always been there. I mean, I I force myself to read the New York Times every day. And it's it's something like glee about this war. Kind of really unpleasant to watch. Yeah. And overwhelmingly their subscribers want more. Yes. They're really you for it about it. So they have a sense that their own destiny is tied up with the destiny of American. And what you said. I mean, I've heard this from people who work in Washington numerous times is I mean, you said almost word for word what they've said who don't like the foreign policy at least, but have had to work with them, which is their lives are meaningless unless they can tinker with the world. And you just can't take that right away. And this came around in a good time for Biden because Biden started off 2021 the first kind of three months, you know, and then you're racing out of the starting line and all this huge program that he was going to do and transform politics and the most progressive president either ever since FDR. And that was that was done like it was clear by early summer that was going to be done. And it was formally done by I don't know August or September. It was so fast. I've never seen anything fall apart that fast before. And I think it was like, you know, it was like the challenger trying to get it. And then if you remember, I don't know, by December of 2021, there are articles about the Biden presidency already kind of spinning without purpose and not going to be able to get anything done. They were already kind of writing it off. You know, well, at least it's not Trump, but, you know, this presidency is pretty much dead now. And then the war came and gave everybody a purpose. And I got to say it's I it's scary. You brought this up, John. And I really think this is the thing to keep an eye on and you read Packern. So that if things start going a lot worse for Ukraine, Ukraine's military is held up really well. I mean, you know, too pretty tired old countries bashing each other grinding each other down. But if for if for example, Ukraine's military, I mean, they've taken a lot of casualties and they are substantially smaller than Russia. And if they start to collapse, it's it is very easy to imagine that the Packers and the world that he's in, which is the foreign policy elite world media political intellectual leads on the East Coast, they're going to say we got to get in there and prop them up. You know, maybe start with some air power or something, but like they're not going to just let it collapse like that. It's it's there's a good chance they won't anyway. It's pretty scary. It's a really interesting kind of double thing because it will be framed if that does happen. It will be framed as a pure moral imperative. Yes, we have to do something to stop this from happening. But there was a question nothing right. No, but there was a there was a question that anti war people asked in the lead up to Iraq, which was well, why not North Korea or why not Iran. And the answer was shut up. Yes, but behind that answer was because we can't. Okay. Yes, because it would be dangerous. Yeah, Michael McFall the other day thought it was so clever. He got it from somebody else is like, okay, okay, because he keeps arguing over and over this has nothing to do with NATO expansion. There's just people that keep putting out that lie that it has nothing to do with NATO expansion. It's just, okay, even the head of the CIA was saying that NATO expansion will trip that wire this, you know, this war 15 years ago, whatever. And then he's like, okay, okay, I got one. If if this is about NATO expansion and that's why he invaded Ukraine, why didn't he just invade Finland and Sweden to huh? Nailed ya. It's like because he can't. Yeah, he's pretty good. I'm simple. Yeah, he can't. And I like I don't even know what the hell that means is it's insane. Yeah. Yeah, but there's always, yeah, so there's always a calculation about power often a mistaken one, but a calculation. And then it's holding holding the ground for a moral imperative. But the moral imperative is never allowed to float free. I mighty, mighty few people of the of the millions who claimed the USSR was the sum of all evil, mighty, mighty few of them wanted a war with the USSR, or push for a war with the USSR, because that would have meant annihilation for everybody. So the yeah, there are no pure moral imperatives, but they're concealed calculation. So I think we should we should sum up what happened in the first months of the war, because things happened really quickly. Yes. They were talking all these pundits were a chat, but more serious people in Iraq were doing things also. Basically, the United States and its straggly coalition made a lot of disastrous mistakes in the early months of the occupation. First of all, they claimed it wasn't an occupation, which was not fooling anybody. Then they fired on demonstrators in Georgia. Yeah, yeah, hard of this. I got to say, I remember that when that happened, because the country was still relatively shocked and odd, and there wasn't really activity. I remember my talk with you then when that happened, and you said that because the US military, the soldiers there got scared. It's classic. Got scared and shot a bunch of people and killed a bunch. Was it killed 17 and wounded 70 protesters? And you said, this is crazy. This is going to lead to, you know, guerilla warfare here. And I remember thinking like, I was skeptical. I have to admit. I mean, I believed it would happen eventually. I didn't think that would lead to that. But that's where it started. Faluja. I mean, that did do it. So yeah, you called that. Yeah, well, for one thing, you shouldn't have sent troops into Faluja without no little bit about its history because those were nobody to mess with. And they humiliated them. And with predictable results. There were a few developments. The attacks in Faluja soon. And then for most people, the black water contractors strung up as charred corpses on a bridge in response. Then an anti coalition insurgency started. And it started with a bang. Clearly, these were professionals because Paul Bremer had insisted on disbanding Saddam's officer corps. We might have been willing to work as mercenaries for might not, but might have been willing to work as mercenaries for the occupiers. But now they were out on the streets and other people were willing to hire them like Al-Qaeda in Iraq. So sophisticated car bombs hit the Jordanian embassy as traders to the cause. The United Nations headquarters in Baghdad, which killed the UN leader in Baghdad. And most importantly, Shia Shrine in Najaf killing an important Shia Imam. These were the first moves by Al-Zakawi who had inherited who it was from Zarka and Zarkasin, an interesting Jordanian city, big Chetchen population. Displaced Chetchens. And he wanted to pursue a sectarian war. There was a lot of disagreement within Al-Qaeda about that. But he was all for it. He was going to provoke the Shia into fighting the Sunni and thereby destroy the occupation along the way. But even though there were all these scary, scary things happening, the punditocracy in the US was looking for one thing. Let's get Saddam. We're going to get Saddam. And on December 13, 2003, just before the end of the year, they captured him in an operation called, and I kid Lee Nath, Operation Red Dawn. Operation Red Dawn captured Saddam Hussein. And as I said before, they found him in a hole, just a spider hole, nothing in it but a little food and water. No communications, no link with anybody outside it, in a field near Tikrit, his home base. Now, if there had been real pundits, and this to me seemed important at the time, but if there had been real pundits in the US, like people who both knew what they were talking about and were willing to say so publicly, that would have meant Saddam had nothing to do with the insurgency. You cannot run an insurgency from a one person spider hole with no communications in the ground. You cannot do that. But no one thought about that. They had their second mission accomplished moment. And they said, well, mission wasn't quite accomplished, but now, OK, now, mission accomplished. They'd all convinced each other that the insurgency was this kind of magical thing. I got this so medieval thinking actually, was this magical thing happening that was that was powered by the magic of Saddam not being captured. And that once he was captured, it would be like, it would be like, oh, he's not a god. And it would be like, I don't know, capturing the emperor of Japan or something. So everyone would give up at that point because he had this magical hold. I mean, it wasn't like he was loved in a wreck anyway. No, that's the thing. So stupid. Yeah, you know, like, oh, my god, they caught him. We better give up and start shopping a target now because he's like, alright. Yeah, I mean, they could have seen this too. I think there was a lot of dereliction duty because people must have known this. If you were old enough to live through the first Gulf War, you remembered that Saddam called on all his alleged followers worldwide when he first started getting trouble. Now my pretty fly attack attack the Americans wherever they are. Nothing happened. I know. Nothing happened. Now if hezbollah had done that or a group like that or al-Qaeda, something would have happened. It might not have been successful. I mean, the military operations by girl forces fail a lot of the times, but stuff what happened with Saddam nothing happened because he didn't have anybody out there in the world. He had clan loyalists and to the certain extent he had an officer corps that profited by him, but that was it. Nobody was really eager to die for Saddam. Yeah. I just have a quote here as reclined, who's in New York Times columnist now and the founder of CoFounder Vox. In 2003 when they captured Saddam, here's a quote, I am ecstatic that Saddam was captured. I strongly supported going to war in Iraq for humanitarian reasons and he was the cause of those humanitarian problems. And then here's as reclined eight years later, 2011 quote. I supported the Iraq war based on the argument that Saddam Hussein was an irrational tinpot imperialist who would use weapons of mass destruction the moment he got them. So it kind of changed the story a little bit. Yeah. Oh, they all changed their story. Yeah. And yeah, Paul Brummer, the complete imbusel head of the occupation said ladies and gentlemen, we got him. They love, by the way, in DC, they love that mix of registers like the formal archaism of ladies and gentlemen, and then the pseudo-streetiness of we got him. It hurts my mind. It's very like 1940s Hollywood cinema kind of thing. Yeah, that mixture of formal and Clark Gable could do it. But Bush again proclaimed the kind of magic you're talking about that. In fact, Bush sounds here like something out of a swords and sorcery book quote, in the history of Iraq, a dark and painful era is over. A hopeful day has arrived. All Iraqis can now come together and reject violence and build a new Iraq. Well, it wasn't quite that simple. And I think we were going to have to finish soon. But I think we should. The second development and this was the back break, while the back up broken many times. But the next one was the people that we were allegedly saving. The Iraqi Shia rose up against the occupation in April of 2004. And this is this is what Seth Harp was describing in our interview in the last episode that his convoy was attacked by the Mahdi army, which was a Maktada Assad or his force, his militia basically a Shia. Clergyman. And that wasn't supposed to happen like, okay, the Sunni Iraqis, okay, they they're sedans people officially they hate us, but we'll turn them around with good treatment. The Shia are just going to fall over themselves thanking us as liberators. And then six months into the occupation, they attack in masses. I mean, they didn't attack the ways our cow is people did with carefully constructed bombs that could be placed by a few people. These were mass infantry attacks. Yeah, it was kind of like a tent moment, wasn't it? Yeah, very tense, very tense. Yeah, because I was in America, I remember when that happened and I won't lie because I was so against the war and so against the people who were for the war and the whole crazy fucking culture that when I saw this happening, it was like, well, you feel kind of indicated. You're watching it and you can't stop watching it and you're flipping from Channel Channel because it feels kind of good to be vindicated and you know, sorry for the whatever the other soldiers that were on the other side of that, but like what the hell did you expect? And yeah, it went on and boy, man, I've rarely seen instances of cognitive dis. I guess the only thing that could be compared to it was Trump's victory and the way that that just shocked the hell out of, but that shocked really just one part, one faction, big faction of kind of, you know, the elite and others. This was like the entire mediating class, you know, political and media class was just, and it came like boom, boom, boom, it was this and then see more harsh came out with the Abu Ghraib story and the photos all like within a week or two of each other and then, and then torture scandal came out and then Fuluja happened. And it was just like this whole thing is coming undone so fast and it was so clear that the whole thing was barely stitched together in the first place. And the WMDs failed to make this. And no matter how many rationalizations were invented for that and there were many, it was getting hard to juggle rationalizations for all these epistemological failures, let's say, at the same time, there were just too many balls of flame to be juggled. And it was, you could not say if you knew anything about Iraq, you could not say that, Mokhtada was fighting for Saddam because for God's sake, Saddam had killed Mokhtada's father, Mokhtada's father. I mean, it was blood feud. We saw that for reals when they hanged him, right? And they got out. Saddam and Saddam, yeah, they were calling Mokhtada's father her name. Yeah. And Saddam was was genuinely puzzled at that like, Mokhtada, that little squirt. That was the thought he took to eternity would have been. Yeah, that was revenge. Yeah, I don't know how much more, because before we finish, I have to get in my Michael McFall story. All right. God, if you finish with that. So you want to finish with that? Okay, I mean, in a sense, I think at this point, people understand the war went downhill very fast. I mean, the one thing that happened, you know, who really cares about the provisional council and all this other shit and the surge and, you know, in 2007, eight. Anyway, I want to talk about Michael McFall here because Michael McFall, I knew him again from the exile days. And he was kind of our fun Clinton villain because he was the Clinton regime's sort of, you know, policy mouthpiece. And he was the most quoted guy in the Western press in the late 90s, always saying how, you know, reforms are going great democracy, democracy reforms called the 1996 elections free and fair. Like all that stuff. Then, you know, he was out his buddies were out of power and Bush was in power and he was trying hard to make himself relevant. And then he under Obama, he became for a little while. The, the ambassador to Moscow was pretty disastrous. And then he got into the reshagate thing. I think he really became a major public figure during reshagate and Trump. As one of the leading resurgators and, you know, help set up this Hamilton 68 fake disinformation, sniffer. And then when the war started, his popularity went even more through the roof. And one thing he's been doing since Putin's, you know, full scale invasion, as they call it, you know, since the full invasion in February 2022 is saying, you know, is trying to deal with people who are saying, well, you did a rack. And also what, I mean, Putin kept bringing up the US invasion of Iraq. So he started revising his own history and saying he never supported the Iraq war. And in fact, anybody who opposed that war, as I did, should also for the similar reasons, oppose Putin's invasion of Ukraine, which would be, you know, which would have an argument, you know, something to it. And it wasn't from Michael McFall. So I'm just going to read out a couple quotes here. I mean, let's see 2000 December 2022, as the US ambassador Russia. I constantly had to answer questions from Russians about our invasion of Iraq, even though I personally had nothing to do with that decision. Even in our inactions, we Americans bear some responsibility. So he's kind of saying, I only bear as much responsibility for that war as anybody else in this room here. And then he says here, I was against that war. This is a quote. But the US leaders at the time did not claim that Iraq had no reason to exist or an okay, whatever. So he says I was against that war. And he later says in another time, for those always looking to keep me honest, you can see here what I wrote in real time about Iraq. And then he does a link to Michael McFall.com. Well, funny thing is, Michael McFall.com is heavily edited. It edits out a bunch of articles that I found through the way back machine because I remembered them. So I knew what to look for. So, you know, he says I dare you to find anything. And if you go, if you believe that he's being honest and posting everything he's ever written there, there's like a giant gap between the year 2000 and the year 2014 or something, you know, you wouldn't, you might not know. So like here, for example, in the Christian science monitor September 16, 2002, headlined from McFall, change the policy in Iraq. Here's a quote, as the Bush administration begins the process of promoting democratic regime change along the new frontier in the Muslim world. It must also finish the job in the, on the European frontier. He was, because he was pushing for regime change in the Soviet Union, in the former Soviet Union world as well. And he was saying we have to, you know, yes, bushes right to promote regime change there. But, but also you got to listen to me, we need to do some regime changes over here in my back, you know, my area of interest. Washington Post August 2003 after no WMDs found its wrong time to state the course. And he says here and I quote, President Bush should create a department of democratic regime change, headed by a cabinet level official, the offensive equivalent of the defense oriented department of Homeland Security. He wants a cabinet department like Homeland Security or Department of Defense called the Department of Democratic regime change. The State Department's mission is diplomacy between states, not the creation of new states, the Pentagon's mission should remain regime destruction. It's formidable capacities for regime construction should be moved into a new agency, which would also appropriate resources from USA State Department Treasury blah, blah, blah. I mean, anyway, elsewhere, there's there's other articles where I'm imagining a green hit team. Yes, I know. I mean, you know, the idea that he called himself an opponent of war, but he's saying we should set up a, and a regime change department and replicate what we did in Iraq only do it better and more and in more places. As Lou Reed said long ago, you hit me with a flower. Yeah, nasty stuff. Anyway, it's stuff that he, I think these articles he kind of wishes we had sort of forgotten about them. Yeah, but just remember that with McFaul. I remember right around the same time, Max boot was saying we should come up with an actual office of a colonial office and call it that. And where colonial uniforms like the Brits did and that would help us to rule these places, you know, tell me. Yes, even pith helmets you mentioned it's unbelievable. And look where they are. Yeah. But anyway, so yeah, so, you know, at least, you know, I hope we've at least managed to revive some of the lively times, the horrific slapstick of this phase of American history. The trouble is it won't stay dead. In fact, a lot of people didn't want it to be dead. And they kept digging it up again and propping it up. Yeah, it probably always will be propped up until there's no more American capital to do it with. Yeah. Yeah, it's, it's really bizarre. I mean, if the US didn't keep doing this stuff and messing up the world. I mean, just if you look at it from a presumably American nationalist point of view and not this sort of class interest, America would still be, would probably be, I don't know far wealthier and more sort of culturally and otherwise powerful around the world. I remember when NASA landed on the moon and for a lot of the world that Vietnam kind of spoiled that. Yes. And otherwise, it would have been like a world festival. Right. It would have been fantastic. Right. So they screw it up every time. But you can't, you, you can take their empire away when you pride from their cold dead hands. You can't, you can't take it away from them. And I don't, I don't even know how it happens. You know, what they, I know some people sort of pray for like a collapse of America, you know, people been praying for that for decades now and thinking we're just about there. But all that would happen were that even to happen. It would just mean like completely disempowering and inshittifying the lives of just about everybody except those people. They'd still have everything, maybe not their empire, but they'd still have tyrannical rule over the rest of us and they would take it out on us in a big way too. But anyway, I don't see that happening anytime soon no matter how many screw ups. They could continue to do so. We're stuck with them. And all we can do is throw rocks at them. So let's keep saying that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think we threw a few rocks today. Yeah. That's the best we can do. Yeah. All right. Well, you did say the rocks bother them, right? Yeah. No, no, no, they do because. That's why they have to write their fake meocopas. And you can tell their meocopas are not meocopas at all. It's sort of like, all right, I got to have this up there because I have to point to something that there was even a term mini culpas. Yes. Yes. That developed when there was a rash of apologies, non-apologates for the Iraq war around its fifth anniversary. Most of them went along the lines of, yeah, I supported the war, but not the way he conducted it. Had I known he would have conducted it that way. Had I known, it's like, that's the thing. In that class, none of them in that layer were like allowed to sort of admit to each other that they knew this guy was a dumbass liar. It was unbelievable how obvious it was. In some way in my mind, this is connected with the rash of articles recently, like by A.O. Scott, a sort of a seller corridor reviewer, movie reviewer. Arguing that Tracy Flick is the true hero of election. I mean, I swear there have been at least two articles. I think one was by Jill Filippovich. Another was by A.O. Scott, who was doing the Me Too thing. I don't know when A.O. Scott did his, but I remember during Me Too and suddenly every single woman, including fictional characters like Tracy Flick, who were supposed to obviously be comic villains. They were all victims and good guys now. It was, man, this is connected with supporting Iraq. I may be wrong. I'd probably have. Explain it now. That's the way it works in these neurons. Can you explain your theory of election Tracy Flick Iraq? I suppose it's that Tracy Flick embodies a fierce belief in the norms with absolutely no moral code underneath it. Yes, that's well put. Yeah. Yeah, perfect. I think it's a good way to end this in the show because that's what rules. I mean, you know, you can be nihilistic about it and say, well, that's how you get ahead, folks, but let's be honest. I don't know. I think if you're listening to this podcast, you're most likely. Don't have that disposition and feel it's pretty awful to have it. And so. So we were left with all we can do. It's just toss rocks at him. Yep. Keep doing it. All right. Well, that's our happy throwing everybody. Yeah, look back at the Iraq Wars. We remembered it anyway. Crazy stupid time of and there'll be plenty more coming. Anyway, thanks everyone. Thanks. I'll see you in and talk to you again soon. Okay. Bye bye. Aye. you",
