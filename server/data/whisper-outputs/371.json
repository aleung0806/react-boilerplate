    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. Today is March 24th, 2000 and 23. And this is episode 371. You're listening to Radio Warner at patreon.com forward slash radio Warner where you sign up for the show and the Warner news letters. Anyway, I'm because more games in Rochester, New York, Monroe County, and I'm on the line with the Warner himself, John Dolan, aka Gary Britscher in Glasgow. How's it going there, John? It was a little better. My mouth no longer feels like someone stuck a roofing nail into it. Just, you know, a regular nail. And I'm very grateful for that. I mean, there's nothing as tiring as pain that just goes on and on. Can't sleep, can't write anything. I'm working on a newsletter now, by the way, but for a while I couldn't do anything. I was certainly recommend people in the UK, you know, don't, don't rely on those five star rating services because I mean for dentists. Yeah, especially for dentists because dentists can do you a lot more harm than most restaurants can. Yeah. Well, and, you know, where do those five star ratings come from? I don't think it's that hard to come up with. I don't know, just invent some name and get some stock photo. Yeah, best dental service I've ever had. You too. Yeah. All right. So, yeah, last episode, well, we thought we were going to have a shorter interview with Seth Harp about his experience and writings about the Iraq war, but it turned out to be such a fascinating interview we kept it going. So we didn't get to the second part then, which was we were going to talk about our non combat experience. And what the war looked like to older guys who were in Russia at the time the war broke out and as the war started to build up. And because, you know, it's weird to think this, but when you watch the way people talk about the Iraq war, but by golly, a lot of people were that are sort of in our orbit or subscribers or whatever. So, we were two young to really informed. That's a old we are to have had a real visceral experience, you know, in 2003 as that war happened. But I mean, they've had a visceral experience as they learn more about it later. But it has been like I remember in the camp in the 2020 maybe the 2016 as well and the 2020 Democratic Party primary campaigns people would call it Hillary and then Biden for supporting the Iraq war and you get all these surrogates in the media world and the activist world saying, come on, that was so long ago. A lot of people made a mistake, you know, that's history. We moved on from that. It's like, no, we actually haven't we actually have them. You know, an arc a key architect from the liberal democratic side of making sure that war happened in power. We have them all over the media. You know, they moved on to Ukraine. Obviously, Ukraine's a bit different, but like, but it's still scary. They were part of a very long tradition of pro-war pro intervention self-discrawled liberals. And that goes at least back to the 1940s. Right. Right. That's something else. I mean, you and I were talking about that before the previous show, I think. We talked about it a couple times actually in the last week or two about the whole idea of pro-war liberals because when you were growing up, it was just understood that liberals were possibly more pro activist pro war than conservative Republicans and sort of Eisenhower and Nixon Republicans. Yeah, at least until 1964 when gold water came along and was supposedly in favor of using atomic weapons. And but the difference between him and LBJ, Lyndon Baines Johnson, who was the democratic candidate in 1964 was not that Johnson was anti war at all. He was, Vietnam was already starting to look like a really bad idea. And it was already clear that Johnson and his administration would never budge in the direction of getting out of Vietnam. But the difference officially and they there was a survey by psychiatrist because, you know, people who've never seen gold water in their lives diagnosed him from afar. I think that led to a rule for members of the American Association of Psychiatrists that you don't do that. It was classified until Trump, like most rules did. But they said the man is not mentally fit to be president. But it was not because he was pro war. It was because allegedly he was pro nuke. And that went too far. B-52s loaded to the gunnels with 500 pound bombs. That was fine. But nuke's no, no, no, that was irresponsible. So even then there was nothing like an anti war official democratic party policy. It evolved within the ranks and mostly among younger people because they were pissed off about Vietnam, which was just so obviously stupid that protesting against it started to seem for them. It looked like protesting against the advance of a glacier in the Pleistocene. It did nothing at all. Nobody, as far as I knew, understood why LBJ and his administration could not back off from Vietnam. But they could not. And then that sank them and did them a lot of harms. So then came the brief period that you have Mark have described as the American glossist in roughly the mid 70s. And there was a democracy party thing, right? That was a democracy party. But a wing was it anyway. It was fairly dominant. I mean scoop jacks in the infamous, you know, one of the godfather's of Neocons. He was a democrat, but he was he was a real minority in the democrat. I mean, he was considered by that time by the mid 70s fairly marginal. I mean, he turned out to have a big influence. I guess, but he was fairly marginal, right? I mean, the energy was going the other way at that time. Briefly, but then, well, I think we when Carter refused to bomb Iran roughly in 1979, 80, that became a liability for the democratic party or so they thought they went back to not even supporting their own warmongers. But in effect, cheering for Reagan for all of his eight years in power, they didn't really seem to be running campaigns against Reagan. They were just going along with him. Well, I would say I guess I remember it a bit differently. I would say they were more confused in a way they aren't at all now. They were sort of like it was almost like they weren't sure which way the wind was blowing because they a lot of these people, you know, Biden came to power at that class of 74 Democrats, which was a pretty, you know, by mainstream parties, Democrat party standards. It was a fairly radical class. It was a backlash to the Vietnam War and wars overseas and CIA stuff and Watergate, especially. And so, you know, Reagan came to power and I think they saw how popular he was getting by being straight up John Wayne warmonger. And so they kind of dithered for a while, I think. Like they there was a wing that, you know, the Bolin amendment that did restrict and this was the Democrats that did restrict at least legally what Reagan was allowed to do in Nicaragua. But then they they seem to cheer on other stuff. I mean, they just seem to cave all the time, basically. So you couldn't say they were anti war, but you couldn't say they were pro or they were sort of dither war or something. I think partly dependent on where the war was happening. Certainly when Reagan got at least 245 Marines killed in Beirut in 1982, tip O'Neill, who was the imbicillic leader of the Democrats in Congress, police the party so that no one would try to make political capital out of that. Right. Debacle. Yes. Classic. Classic post. I don't know 1975 Democrat move. Right. We need to cover for the Republicans. That's kind of a lot of what they did. Yeah. And I guess that's probably just made a bigger impression on me than anything else. No, you're right. The first Iraq war, some big name, you know, Democrats did oppose it. Biden. Believe you voted against the resolution. John Kerry definitely did. They, I think at the time, still thought that's where the base was. That's where the popularity was going to be. I think after the first Gulf War and the Swift victory, they they never really went there again, most of the party. But yeah, that kind of sealed it, I think, for them. Yeah. And it's interesting. You mentioned scoop Jackson, who's probably most of our audience have never heard of him. He was right wing Democrat. Nixon's favorite Democrat. And he became sort of his staff became a nursery. Yes. And for many of the people we're going to end up talking about in this episode, Richard Pearl worked for him. And a lot of darkness. Yeah. The groups, these people joined were often named for scoop Jackson. Right. They worked really long and hard. And they were, they were dull psychos in that line from in the loop. They were very much people who did their homework served on various boring DC committees, war tie every day and pushed for the war. Not easy at the time because in the meantime, this big thing happened. The USSR had collapsed. It's hard to believe now. But at the time that let a lot of people to think, okay, we can give up this endless arms race. And that was not a conclusion that anybody who mattered liked very much. Yeah. Yeah. You know, going through this again, a key moment, I think, pretty a key moment in document. Because I think I brought this up in the past. I feel like it gets forgotten too much. It's, it's the 1992 defense planning guidance. And it leaked. Somebody was so shocked within the Pentagon that they leaked it to the New York Times and then everybody freaked out. And they, they claim to have, I'll get to the story. But basically this defense planning guidance, what it is, is it's a classified strategy document that the Pentagon produces every two years outlines the military strategy, basically the Empire strategy. And then defense budgets are sort of built around that. So the Iraq war, the first Iraq war, you know, had concluded there was no enemy anymore because I mean, there's no cold war anymore anyway because Soviet Union collapsed. And so what was, you know, so people, as you said, the average Joe thought, oh, then that's all over. We can wind down, you know, all this massive military spending Reagan and Bush, you know, their defense budgets were insane. The way that they quadrupled under Reagan. But this defense plan, so Cheney, who was defense secretary of defense at the time, tasked Paul Wolfeowitz, his underling former scoop Jackson guy to come up with the new defense planning guide guidance document. And Wolfowitz then had Scooter Libby, all these names, man, like you said, they all stay there all throughout that time. Khalil Zad, you remember the Trumps, yeah, to write this with him. And what they came up with was that the strategy for the US would be from henceforth to make sure that there was no, no rival to US military power could not only would arise, but even could arise. And so defense spending would have to be such that the US would be so far advanced from any potential rival anywhere that no rival would even think of trying to compete because it would take them 30 years to even start to catch up to the US militarily. So it would be pointless. And I mean, I'll just even quote a little part here is that the goal would be to quote prevent any hostile power from dominating a region whose resources would under consolidated control be sufficient to generate global power. And then as a corollary to that, it's called for bringing in all the new central and Eastern European states and former Soviet states as many as possible into security packs under the US control basically NATO to protect them from Russia, which might one day become a hostile power. When this leaked actually wolf a witz funny enough, you got we got rattled by the bad press and basically said I didn't approve of this. And and and Coleol is odd got very upset by the way wolf a witz basically did you know that far side with the the the scope the sniper scope of the bear pointing at the other bear points at the other bear. Yeah. And so he got really upset. But that but Cheney saw it so Coleol got really a Cleo is odd got really down about it scooter Libby was hiding and then Cheney got a hold of me say wow I like this. Yeah, he said told Coleol's odd quote you've discovered a new rationale for our role in the world. But the sick thing is so so because this leaked to create a controversy. And so they said they were going to go back and soften it and what Libby did was he actually made it far more radical. And from we shouldn't allow arrival to arise to we shouldn't even allow the possibility of arrival to rise within decades and but this has been this has been strategy. I mean let's be honest this has been strategy ever since one thing that always strikes me and I've had a part of reading the comment sections is occasionally trying to intervene in in comment threads under various pseudonyms which I have tried at length. And one thing you find out is average people are gullible as they come when it comes to defense budgets. You will you will say you know how come you only get four f 35's for a billion dollars freedom isn't free. I mean that's the level of response I think they had been so well trained by decades of cold war yeah that they responded like populous dogs they you know you rang a defense bell in the bar. So those guys were just exploiting that I mean if if you're dealing with a bunch of suckers and they'll give you their money without even needing a good story. You're going to do it. You know one other thing that sort of happens at this time will talk about a little bit I think is that I mean if if you were to kind of describe the rational for military and covert operation interventions around the world by the US and there were you know countless of them during the cold war. The guiding ideology that rally public support was anti communism. So you know people would folks would call that a negative a negative ideologies and they really wanted to do it to also promote a positive one but the positive one which would be spreading capitalism people aren't as much willing to die for that but the fear of communism was it was genuinely an organizing principle a successful one. Since Carter started to change that some it started with Carter kind of got murkier under Reagan but then really re-emerge later to promoting democracy democracy promotion has been a really effective organizing mobilizing force for war interventions covert and over since then. And but it didn't really come into its own until after the end of the big cold war mean it starts the 90s democracy promotion and human rights and that whole thing the liberal intervention even human rights has a kind of. Comprehensible meaning to democracy yes i really don't know i mean i've lived in New Zealand for 10 years i lived in the US for 10 years. Which is more democratic i have no idea i couldn't get decent drugs either place that that's one thing i'm at least i had healthcare in New Zealand i don't i it's an endlessly complex thing but when you reduce it to democracy it seems to mean something to most people it really doesn't mean much of anything and as you say it works the interesting thing is during this time of the supposed piece dividend. Defense budgets in Western Europe did go down Russian defense budgets did go down at that time the Chinese defense budget was so. Yeah it wasn't worth mentioning the US remained flat in the early 90s and then zoomed zoomed after 9 11 and it didn't go down as much i seem to remember there was always this fight about it that the US defense. Defense budget went down but it never went down as much as people hoped or wanted it to remember a lot of articles also about like the CIA like what's its mission anymore i mean even Patrick Moynihan who was Nixon's other favorite Democrat was in the early 90s calling for abolishing the CIA and be warning like what's its role anymore nobody asked that anymore after 9 11 yeah. But yeah and and you know the whole thing about Saddam Hussein. As the great enemy. I mean they were looking for enemies to just file this and you know Saddam Hussein was. The enemy the top enemy for one faction and Molosevic started to become the top enemy. For another faction and they were both hit you know vying for the Hitler of the year you know ward in Washington. Yeah or they were both Hitler's at the same time I don't know. But you did get a lot of that in the media. Yeah Mademoiselle was easier to deal with you could do him as a quick errand and they did because Serbia was just about exhausted and let out. They still managed to lose a stealth fighter but it went quickly. Iraq was supposedly a much bigger project but people started working these these are people who do their homework who stay in place as we said work really hard. So in 1997 Bill Crystal as you said Mark single handedly destroyed his dad's reputation decades of warming his way into the right wing in DC and eventually destroyed his whole movements reputation. In 97 he wrote Saddam must go how to guide and that was in the weekly standard. Yeah I think you understand the weekly standard better than I do. What was the weekly standard was set up and financed by Rupert Murdoch as a nursery of ideas of of neocon ideas. Yeah and right at the same time that that he put this out this was the same year that he and Robert Kagan founded the project for a new American century. Which was really like also a think tank incubator for everything that was going to come under the bush. But again it's sort of founding ideas very similar to that to that Pentagon strategy document. I mean it's the goal was to promote global American leadership American leadership is basically American domination. And of course domination is more like this because this was sort of barely concealed urge to terrorize the world. I mean that's really what there's this quote from I'm not trying to pronounce his name correctly but Raul Mark Diracht who was briefly a big name in the PNAC. It's an astonishing quote but it's very typical of how people were talking of the millennium in DC. Quote we have no choice but to re instill in our foes and friends the fear that attaches to any great power. Only a war against Saddam has saying will decisively restore the all that protects American interests abroad and citizens at home. Yeah that passed without any flinch at the time but it's really remarkable to re instill in our foes and friends the fear. We have to frighten our friends. And all they do is think we're a bunch of freaking weirdos and they're right. That's the thing. I mean so much American power is in spite of these people but they're the only ones who really want to use it. And it's in its worst ways so you know that's what happens. Yeah American power for so many decades was cool cars and bugs bunny and all that worked a lot better. But it's also important to note so among the directors of the PNAC. It was Bruce Jackson. This is kind of an important character. Bruce Jackson. He was the main architect of the lobbying effort in the 90s to expand NATO. I mean he was recognized by everybody as the guy who pushed through expanding NATO. He also moonlit as a VP for Lockheed. So it worked out well for both ends. But he was really the guy that pushed it through. And there was a lot of opposition even in like the New York Times editorial pages because they all kind of understood this is the defense companies who have lost contracts from the scaling down of defense budgets looking for new markets. And all it's going to do is create an enemy out of Russia which will then justify the expansion of NATO. I mean when you look back that's what they said. I think what's interesting is two years later so that's 1997 right and then 1999 a couple big things happen. One is the NATO war in Kosovo which we're still living with the consequences of it. I'm not saying that Serbia, I mean what Serbia was doing to Albanian ethnic Albanians in Kosovo was absolute repression. But you can make a bad situation worse for the world by doing what the US and its allies did which is they tried to get UN support. For military action the UN refused to give it and so NATO decided to bomb anyway. And this was the template very openly the template for the war in Iraq in Richard Holbrook he very openly when he argued for the invasion of Iraq in 2003 he said we already set the precedent in 1999 with the bombing of Kosovo. So it's out that you don't need UN support you do it because we're right and that's it. But yeah and there's another angle that really fits in with the threat of the peace dividend which is I wrote a big newsletter called NATO and autobiography a while ago. And the thing that really shocked me was NATO's first military action as NATO was in the first Gulf War that is 1991 and then in Kosovo that is NATO as all of us living under it understood or thought we understood was a way of containing the Soviet threat. But NATO's first military actions did not come until the Soviet threat had already evaporated. Right which suggests something else was going on. Yeah. Yeah. Other things that were really important about the Kosovo war. I mean, and seeing this from Russia seeing Western reporter. So I remember a lot of Western reporters coming over to Russia. So throughout the 1990s Americans in particular and some other Westerners had this absolute missionary zeal in Russia to transform Russia into into our image, you know, vaping the same ideas about neoliberal ideas about free markets democracy and all this stuff and then seeing what we wanted to see and completely missing what was actually happening there. And I remember and then and everything collapse. So then at the end of 1998 because what was actually happening in Russia was, you know catastrophe an economic and political absolute nightmare catastrophe as we've talked about. The financial system completely collapse it was the greatest financial system collapse in decades at that time. And then the American missionary the mission was dead and then a few months later the Americans first they start asking themselves, what do we do wrong? How could we not see it? Then they decided actually we were right we were good our intentions were good as the Russians were bad they didn't listen to us they didn't take our medicine. And then they found this real mission is new mission which was to fight fascism in Kosovo just like the greatest generation did in World War II to fight fascism to save refugees and fight fascism. And I swear to God no one believed in this more than the media class it was so it was so strange to see all these people like activated people I knew in the media world talking like they were the new George Orwells and you know. And the homage to Catalonia sense. Yeah and absolutely the homage to Catalonia sense yes and this was a really big deal because in the 90s I think two two movies that had a huge impact on sort of boomers particularly and maybe a certain part of Gen X is definitely boomers was first shinlers list above all shinlers list I wasn't there I'm only remembering this after kind of going back going back over time like realizing yeah shinlers list had a huge cultural political influence on people who are interested in politics in any way. And then saving private Ryan so you know people whereas they looked at their real lives in the 90s and it was like we're going to talk about Monica Lewinsky and you know the contract with America things seemed so dull people a lot of people with big educations and big media jobs really. Really relish the idea of having this what appeared to be historical purpose you know without seeing what the cost of a precedent set which is you can now bomb another country and carve out a new state I mean we set the precedent you know you could bomb a sovereign country illegally and it was illegal and it was a war of aggression which is the number one crime. And you know and use the pretext of internal repression to do it and you know the Russians and Putin they refer to it all the time in fact yeah that was the first time in that whole decade when Americans were involved in so much destruction in Russia but Americans were loved up until the bombing of Serbia and that was the first time I ever saw publicly. Russians really turn yeah both scared and angry at America well I remember the what was the airport they evacuated under pressure. Pretty still yeah pretty still yeah I remember that moment as as a deep humiliation among all Russians yeah and. Yeltsin just seemed to exemplify that humiliation I mean of course he did yeah of course he shamed us that's he was their creature and he groveled to them but you know that there there's a weird cultural moment speaking of cultural stuff here that occurred I guess in the early 90s mid 90s there was flash in the pan band called believe me. And I remember not James the British British pop band and they had a song that was supposedly about the Berlin wall coming down and it was watching the world wake up from history and one of the lines was Bob Dylan didn't have this to sing about. It was kind of not not just yearning to be the greatest generation but envy and and so on resentment of the boomers as well like yeah no you all had a purpose but look at us but it wasn't very thrilling I mean what did the what did the fall of the wall do well I mean it gave people a place to move to to be expats for a while but it didn't. I mean it ushered in you know neoliberalism in shock therapy and it wasn't very. Satisfying spiritually like okay so now they have more goods than they used to have wow you know now they can make market choices the market like yeah so but another thing so. Another thing I want to bring up here so 1999 so after that you know the the Russian kind of deep state establishment or as fractured as it was totally flipped out over this and you know eventually pretty quickly this leads to. Yeltsin appointing Putin you know that is the FSB chief as his prime minister he tried a different FSB guy X KGB guys to passion that didn't work to get a war on it in Chichania and the war in Kosovo had a lot of influence very much the conduct of Russia's second Chichan war we've talked about that in the past particularly how it managed information but. And here's kind of one of the things I want to get to in 1999 the same crowd that put together the project for a new American century since two years later the the church of war starts. And this is the only place in the whole Muslim world they they actually shed a tear for they launch a new committee calls or a new huge sort of you know yeah committee called the American committee for peace in Chichania it's chaired by Brazinski who's openly talked about how you know the big goal is. And this is to bring you know bring Eurasia permanently under U.S. power yeah and it said compared to crushing Russia which he means in a in a good way isn't that glorious what are a few angry Muslims yeah he meant that by helping create Al Qaeda in Afghanistan yeah it's chaired by Brazinski and Al Hague noted peace nicks and on its and then its directors included Bill crystal James Woolsey Robert Kagan same people. Elliott Abrams all the peace nicks Richard Pearl and then Bruce Jackson who you know who's the guy that expanded NATO now he's basically in a committee to try to support the Chichen rebels and you know. And you know him down Russia and then the next whatever couple years later when bush comes to power bush asks him to start up a committee for the liberation of Iraq which he did so he started up the committee for the liberation of Iraq which is the main lobbying group then for war with Iraq. So there's a good see you just kind of like a neat line there yeah and then i'm basically this is this part of the history everyone knows very well so we move through it quickly to the results. The Republicans win or at least straight arm i grabbed the ball from the Democrats because they want it more in 2000 they win the presidency and 9 11 happens and that's everybody's license to go insane and as everybody used to say I mean there was a movie about Sean Hannity in Salt Lake City. He gets all these smart ask questions in an auditorium and every time he just does this brain dead smirk and says what you don't understand is 9 11 changed everything he can say that 200 times in a row and he does in this movie and it is the ultimate answer to any quibbles you can do whatever you want. But you had to get it had that it was for mostly a kind of different audience but it was it was this I have a mission now I have a person life there was so much of that going around when 9 11 happened i wasn't Kentucky that year you were at your new Zealand so i wasn't in russia and. It was a strain it was strange because I have to admit I had. I had no visceral reaction at all like I wasn't for it you know i'm not for the bombing me it was it was. Kind of stunning to watch it on TV but I didn't I saw these people psyched up and telling me that they had a purpose I was belong to a YMCA member guys talking about how you know yeah this has been prophecy in the bible and. You know we're paying for our sins and this but we now have a purpose like there was a lot of that at least out in Kentucky where I was but it was all over the place I mean yeah even liberals in New York city else everyone just suddenly at a purpose and kind of thought everything's gonna change America's gonna change can be more serious we're all gonna bind together and and i'm like nothing really fucking changed you know in that sense anyway. Yeah but you're right there was there was a feeling that we have been scorched and this will make us more virtuous yes yeah I felt that in New Zealand too I mean I could see it in the interviews but actually just to describe briefly what happened in New Zealand it was like. I heard it on the car going in that morning and the big news because it's a very sporting country is. Will the Olympics go on after these attacks in New York City and apparently they would go on so I I do my usual health breakfast like a giant bottle of coke at and and a cream cake thing at at this 7 11 kind of place I go into my office because I was always the first one there in the morning because of goddamn mid students and I'm gonna go get a drink and I'm gonna have a drink and. Then I have to go to my various TAs rooms they're called tutors but if they amount to TAs and the funniest thing was everybody had come and dear every. TV they could get and we had several sets because we're videoing student speeches in this class. And there was a really avid happy audience around the TV's i don't think it was America and I don't think in all cases it was anti-Americanism let me put it that way I think it was just. Like oh boy. It's happening yeah but when I came in because I was standing for America. Everybody be grabbing for the remote and trying to turn it off and saying oh sorry yeah it's terrible yeah I didn't want to hear it I much as you were saying I. Yeah feel very much about it at all except bitterly frankly I was thinking god damn it this never happened to London. You're so. Yeah yeah I you know it's funny so I didn't feel that feeling I didn't feel endangered being in Kentucky like okay you know yeah they went after the two largest buildings in the biggest city. You know that doesn't have much to do with me and but I think the anthrax attacks which is still a big giant mystery after all these years. Those felt a little bit that those caused as I recall kind of more granular level middle American fear. Because it suddenly seemed like I don't know the state had didn't have control over things at all and anybody could get it at any time and then of course there were people fanding those fears for their own reasons I mean you know we famously know about all the Neocons. And a large part of the American people thought the state was doing it right they're always ready to believe that in a way it's a reassuring conclusion. It suggests that someone really is in charge but after that there there was a weird contained vengefulness or a channeled vengefulness the people who mattered channeled the rage in the direction they wanted which was Iraq and Afghanistan and the defense budget. There were other manifestations like a bunch of seats got beat up because idiots thought Muslims were turbines because I don't know they read little or finance or something but that was strongly disapproved. What was approved was yeah very greatest generation militarized vengefulness purposeful quiet though not that quiet. And effective that was that was strongly admired we were supposed to be more Roman yeah Victor Davis handsome was saying. Yeah right yeah there was that sense to among a lot of scared and or kind of excited even sort of centrist and liberals and you know city slickers that they're almost kind of happy that the Bush administration people were in power I mean maybe maybe bush himself was a problem they were trying to convince themselves they that he had. Churchillian you know rhetorical abilities if you remember some of that but but they were they were happy nevertheless to have dad like grown ups with were dad like in their minds like the conservative dad that they once rebelled against that they now are glad isn't power you know they're in power. Powerful rums felt. Cheney of course strong disciplinarians yes strong discipline and you know of course it turned out run so it was just an unbelievable doofus like just that Steve Carell depiction of him in vice was just so great so perfect yeah just a dumb frat boy you know with a lot of ambition. I mean if you heard our interview with with Seth Harp he clearly still remembers with resentment uh rumsfelds smart mouth comment which he made to a bunch of serving military people well you know you don't go to war with the army you want you go to the war with the army that you have and this was in response to a question about why can't we have decent helmets you know or something like that so. They were not an impressive cast I remember and this is an important question because when we talk about media coverage of the war. One question that that I at least obsess on is did they know they were lying and did they just feel that that it was for the good of the country that they had to say certain things like everybody talked about George W. Bush's heroic conduct in the aftermath of the war. The problem was that was on video and he was sitting there reading my pet goat to a group of elementary school kids I didn't make him do that he decided to do that. I'm not saying anything about him it's just he was actually reading my pet goat to a bunch of elementary schools kids and he gets a little mumble in the year from what is presumably a secret service guy. No it was Andrew Card I think. And he does a sort of a meme before it was a meme you know the one of that of that stuff toy that looks to the side and then looks back with his beady little eyes he's like what do we do now. And then he goes back to reading my pet goat and they somehow made then then he flies to an undisclosed. Yeah then he's nagging post I mean this is the whole thing it's like that could have actually been his moment he could have flown to the Pentagon or to New York City. You know like like that absolute freak Giuliani went down there and that made him you know somebody who's an absolute freak it made him into a hero for 10 years that took people to get over that. He could have done that and taken a little small little chance tiny chance. Yeah but I mean so let's he does that. Yeah it's not that hard the risk is not that much but it must feel great. And Bush was too weak or too outright cowardly. I couldn't get over that man I have to admit that that that really shocked and pissed me I was in the country at that time and then to hear people saying wow he's real you know he's going to do something he's he's mad and he's like are you kidding me this guy fled and hid in a hole like you know I mean everyone trashes the dom for a lot of all. Yeah like he actually had something to be scared about but that was just that was pathetic man. Yeah and they lied they just outright lied that's what I wonder and I honestly I wonder even now like when people wrote about Bush's courage in the aftermath of the one one. Did they know they were lying or did they they just invent a courageous bush to match the needs of the moment. My guess is the marketing people the robes or whatever knew they were lying and these are people that really get a thrill from lying cleverly and and having it succeed. So that's one class but the other people who carry on the lie what they know is there are lies that people want to believe and they're not going to question him even though their own eyes might have told them something differently they want to believe it and I can tell you everybody wanted to believe that they had a brave president because what what other purposes there have having a dumb Texan yeah except that he's supposed to be brave right yeah I mean he's a ritual king he's supposed to. Stand up at the head of the army or at the podium and look brave he couldn't even manage that yeah that was that was just unbelievable but yeah the ability to lie to yourself I mean you know that's that's the question with the whole lead up to the Iraq war did people believe what they were writing and you know it's sort of like. I mean you know do people believe rush a gate as they were doing it we just saw this right so we've seen various versions of this where everyone whips each other up and the lies and you get rewarded for it so I don't know the brain is a strange thing it's the brain can be like well I'm getting a reward by pressing this button you know a little treat comes out and this is the lie but whatever and the other button which is the truth you know I press it and I don't get anything or I get a problem so I'm going to keep pressing the lie. Like it yeah well the few people who did tell the truth paid for it yeah and I'm not a Bill Marfan but he did at least lose his job after 9-11 by saying well you can call these guys a lot of things but you can't call them cowards yeah they gave their lives for this and they knew they were giving their lives filled on you with him about that they just fired him yeah filled on a human yeah was a big name when I was younger he was like Oprah Winfrey. But and then moved into politics and he got fired I mean it's pretty incredible yeah but after that once you know once 9-11 had sunk in there was a really interesting move which was part of what became the genesis of the war nerd project which you and I invented in Moscow around 2002 partly because I was so furious that I'd spent my entire wretched adolescence in the reference rooms of libraries looking up James weapons and now suddenly people who'd been in my mind having a really great time were now claiming to be military pundits and it was it was driving my rage through the roof so we tried to come up with Gary Bretcher as a character to embody that resentment. But some of the stuff they came up with was astonishing even by the hysterical standards that prevailed in America after 9-11 here's a story from news week in the weeks just before the US invaded Afghanistan. And one of the problems by the way in Afghanistan is the USAF said we can't hit anything there is nothing but a bunch of mudhuts it's not worth our time so anyway here's the story. Days after 9-11 a senior Pentagon official lamented the lack of good targets in Afghanistan and proposed instead US military attacks in South America or Southeast Asia as a surprise. As a surprise to the terrorists well yes that would be the unsigned top secret memo which appears to have been written by defense under secretary Douglas 5th who was called by Tommy Frank's the dumbest fucking guy in the planet is one of several Pentagon documents uncovered which advance on orthodox ideas for the war on terror. The memo suggested hitting targets outside the Middle East in the initial offensive or a non al-Qaeda target the memos content news week has learned was in part the product of ideas from a two man Pentagon intelligence unit appointed by faith after 9-11 they argued that an attack on terrorists in South America for example a remote region on the border of Paraguay Argentina and Brazil. Where intelligence reports said Iran backed his willow had a presence would have ripple effect on other terrorist operations. The proposals were floated to top foreign policy advisors but White House official stress they were regarded wearily and never adopted. Now okay this is the most amazing thing in the world the Pantanal is one of the great swamps of the world like maybe the greatest living swamp of the world now and it was a big part of the action in the war of the triple alliance so we've studied it before but the idea that what would really surprise these people in Afghanistan and Iraq is if we hit his bala which had happened. Which had absolutely nothing to do with any of it in the Pantanal like first of all you have to believe that his bala is hunkered down you know with the storks and the Caymans in the Pantanal is like the Caymans are going to say oh there's a mark on the tougher than we thought okay we got to get the word back to Afghanistan and Iraq. Yes, suck remember the famous Tom Friedman line you know we went in there and we showed them and we said hey suck on this. It's Tom Friedman in a street fight that's really tough they were all like that for a while though I mean that quote that you quoted from that neocon about we're going to make even our friends fear of the respect is like people watch these old Roman. They didn't care about being loved they wanted to be feared and respect. I want to see what I'm trying to tramp and feed and sort of metal noises. Yeah, oh they're so dumb that's funny though because this is so this is classic Rumsfeld I mean again there was that time probably because he wore glasses and he looked like a dad or something and people wanted to believe that he was considered one of the intellectual brains of the Bush administration and he was like a man. We would say something that had been said to the administration and he would say things essentially like you know we need to think outside the box here and then so and that was such corporate thinking okay we got to think outside the box with. Let's think outside the box a Doug faith or David let's why do you get some of your guys together and you think outside the box it's like where is the least likely place this is so outside the box where is that for sure not a single terrorist who we do you know here's a swamp nobody's live where for a thousand years let's bomb that place and show them. It's incredible I mean somehow that takes me back to the the old hippie days where I was reading in a givot I think iron butterflies one album in a lot of David they were one hit wonder and it was the usual four white guys group and on the back cover there were photos of the four of them and little capsule descriptions and one of them red Steve is the deep picker of the group even at 15 I thought oh come on. Oh man yeah it's pretty said just somewhere south you know the global south right so yeah it was I mean these were the people who were supposed to be the brains but it's so strange like there's no brain power at all but but there's somehow reliable for something else I mean there yeah I suppose they'll show up on meet the press they live within half an hour yes studios whatever absolutely and they watch it religiously it's funny you know do people watch those shows anymore face the nation and meet the press I'm sure somebody I'm sure somebody does still and definitely did those shows mattered they were kind of news makers shows for a while I mean that that's where a chainy would come to drop his latest disinformation you know about the connections between Al Qaeda and Saddam or you know nuclear weapons well but magazines like weekly standard weren't meant for the commoners right they were meant to be circulated yes among the Norman Klaattura but Washington yeah they were meant to it was for Washington DC in a Telekord or audience and meant to represent a faction and you know look I mean what the Neal cons they had an idea ideology which is you know this imperialist like out now to imperialist more imperialist than anybody else but they also had an ideology that that connected them to a major power interest which was the weapons industry and the Pentagon and the whole national security state like they made sure that it's not like they came up with these ideas out and and sort of floated them just out there to write clever articles I mean they were essentially representing the weapons industry so today you still have you know that institute for the study of war I mean that's it that's a Kagan joint and it's backed by all the big defense companies like it's yeah that's how it works well before we move on from 9-11 and the aftermath I want to give a plug to our sound genius Brendan and we were talking about 9-11 a moment ago and Brendan has done the sound for two shows on the history channel about 9-11 one of them is called 102 minutes that changed America and Brendan did the sound by making a sort of collage of real sound clips from the moment by moment experience of 9-11 it sounds amazing that's Brendan and Derek 102 minutes that changed America on the history channel and the other one is 9-11 the days after about how America reacted in the days and weeks after 9-11 yeah I'm actually gonna watch that one 102 minutes I'd like to see something make music out of it yeah real quickly because it is so amazing you can actually never ever ever get tired of it and nobody should do you want to listen to that clip of Thomas Friedman telling Charlie Rose you know we went into a rack to tell him to suck on this yeah yeah now that the war is over and there's some difficulty with the peace was it worth doing well I think it was unquestionably worth doing Charlie and I think that looking back I know certainly feel I understand more what the war was about can it seem to talk about it here in Silicon Valley because I think looking back at the 1990s I can identify that there are actually three bubbles of the 1990s there was the Nasdaq bubble there was the corporate governance bubble and lastly there was what I would call the terrorism bubble and the first two were based on creative accounting the last was based on moral creative accounting well the terrorism bubble that basically built up over the 1990s said flying airplanes into the World Trade Center that's okay wrapping yourself with dynamite and blowing up Israelis in a pizza parlor that's okay because we're weak and they're strong in the weak have a different morality having your preachers say that's okay that's okay having your charity is raise money for people who do these kinds of things that's let me guess that's okay and having your press call people who do these kind of things martyrs that's okay and that built up as a bubble Charlie and 9-11 to me was the the peak of that bubble and what we learned on 9-11 in a gut way was that that bubble was a fundamental threat to our open society because there is no wall high no I and S agent smart enough no metal detector fish and enough to protect an open society from people motivated by that bubble and what we needed to do was go over to that part of the world on the freight and burst that bubble I'm afraid we needed to go over there basically and take out a very big stick right in the heart of of that world and and burst that bubble and there was only one way to do it because part of that bubble said we've got you this bubble is actually going to level the balance of power between us and you because metaphors we're ready to sacrifice and all you care about are your stock options and your hummers and what they needed to see was American boys and girls going house to house from bus Ra to Baghdad and basically saying which part of this sentence don't you understand you don't think you know we care about our open society you think this bubble fantasy we're just going to let it grow well suck on this no I'm sure that Charlie was what this was about all right yeah that's that's with this bubble wow yeah Tom Friedman street fog all right yeah was it was that sort of a cell accord or pseudo street dog talk that that help give I mean that gave rise to the Warner as like as a reaction as a response to those phonies I mean absolute phonies and they were I mean deadly phonies but phonies yeah frightening deadly phonies they all have that tone of voice to the kind of like Jeffrey Gettelman's is that it's that same that same nursery school teachers yes well you know I think we need to say I'm suck on this you know what part of this sentence do you not understand wow I mean I and I think I've said this before but I wrote on a train on an ham track once with Friedman and he is you know you hear this sometimes about like celebrities but he's really small I mean really not just small but like I don't know diminutive with this large head really tiny shoulders and this this like large care you know his head it's sort of like it's been inflated like twice in size with this huge mustache and he just he just always looks like he's he's thinking to himself like what what contemporary clich\u00e9s that I learned on the last golf outing can I spin for a new story about jewel politics you know I mean he just God and those does metaphors the bubble you know there's this bubble and that bubble and you need to take it out of the bubble and the stick honestly you've got like some imagine a looney tunes cartoon character with it with a big bubble gum bubble and then somebody comes up with a sharp stick yeah black but he didn't even he didn't even allow for a nail or a needle in that stick just stick god bless him and he's of course still with us still pontificating so let's talk a little bit I think about the actual lead up to the war yeah the chronology of the war I mean the there were two invasions that had to be done in the minds of the administration one made immediate sense to most people at the time made less and less sense as the years went on but at the time it made sense al Qaeda was based in southern Afghanistan so doing something to Afghanistan made sense to most nationalist Americans and that began really quickly with a bombing campaign maybe 20 days after 9-11 very quick response and that at this stage was mostly a proxy war but it was clear that this war was sort of demanded by the public and what really interested the administration was going into Iraq except that was a lot harder to explain and they had to work really hard for a really long time so 2001 to 2003 was devoted to persuading the American public such as it was that there was good reason to go into Iraq because a lot of people thought well they were in Afghanistan and we bombed Afghanistan they're on the run now and then later by the way they've gotten away now we didn't capture Mullah Omar the leader of the Taliban we didn't capture Osama because as it turned out he was safely in the hands of our Pakistan administration allies so whatever we've at least installed a different government in Afghanistan that's done but not at all the point was to do the transition to Iraq and that's where it got weird yeah I just remember thinking again watching this from Russia for a while if they can't be serious I mean like it was so clear they were inventing they were just propagandizing and inventing something and it at you know you learn and again this happened with Russia gate as well that as Grady Fringwood say volume volume volume I mean if you flood the airways flood people's heads with the inevitability of it or something and don't allow for any real space outside of it that I don't know you can make it happen you mentioned in a tweet that Washington Post ran a hundred forty front page articles promoting an Iraq invasion 27 editorials pushing for the war in the six months leading up to the invasion yeah the invasion happened on March 20th 2003 and of course nobody at Washington Post was fired or disciplined in any way no Fred Hyatt I mean to Fred Hyatt who was the Russia correspondent in the Yeltsin years got everything totally wrong you know he was blowing Yeltsin blowing the the new oligarchs as baby billionaires just trying to normalize the country completely blindsided by the financial collapse and what happens next he gets kicked up to probably the single most influential certainly editorial page job in the world the editorial page the house editorials in the Washington Post have enormous poll on you know capital Hill they do and it's a company newspaper in a company town yeah and then he gets that completely wrong and literally stayed there until he died on the job one a year or two ago and he died sort of young strangely enough and the guy took over is just carrying on you wouldn't even know it's like chatbot GPT or you know Hyatt chatbot GPT is just putting out the exact same editorials with the exact same party line same crap yeah you know another line before I we can't forget this you were talking about the tough guy craziness of these neocons and the bouches and stuff this was a famous one and this got sort of forgotten um Ron Syskin the journalist first published this in the New York Times magazine 2004 of course they started publishing this stuff when the war started going bad then you could start telling the truth and he talked about a discussion he was having with a top white bush aid in the White House about something or other and it's thought that it's Karl Rove but it's never been 100% confirmed and this person this unnamed top bush political advisor said to Russ Syskin here I'll just quote from the article the aid said that guys like me were quote in what we call the reality based community unquote which he defined as people who quote believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality unquote I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism empiricism he cut me off quote that's not the way the world really works anymore he continued we're an empire now and when we act we create our own reality and while you're studying that reality judiciously as you will we'll act again creating other new realities which you can study too and that's how things will sort out we're histories actors and you all you will be left to just study what we do I mean the boasting you know the the dorky nerdoid boasting here but but like with real teeth behind it you know with this giant arsenal behind it so weird weird fucking people oh yeah very I mean very and as you're implying the the level of nerdiness here is really clear to anybody who grew up scared of everybody on the playground but then went home to read about Alexander the great I'm not talking about myself for so I was I was the lead and well rejected yeah but my elementary school's water polo team personally but yeah that does happen a lot and there's a reason that bush called Grove turd blossom this would be like turd blossoms revenge yes turd blossom going yeah that's really funny sir than going in all right Sasken listen to this you I make reality you are nobody yeah somehow it reminds me of that god awful rob Reiner movie a few good men I really yes because I think that was a 1990s movie and I remember thinking at the time what the hell happened to these people's minds I know people love that line you can't handle the truth everybody is that guy now you can't handle no you can't handle the truth no both the news can't handle the truth I can handle the truth like it's about strangling some guy who doesn't fit into the gungho little click and and that's somehow heroic I I don't get it and then Jack Nicholson as the nationalist epitome of self-sacrifice I was a bit of a stretch too but the the whole thing just seemed weird and gratuitous at the time like I don't know what's what's happened to these people but it does show I think that there was the will to be part of some vaguely fascistic nationalistic movement long before 9-11 came along and gave them a reason right absolutely so so let's let's continue on with the lead up to the war here and some of the other things I mean look we haven't really talked about the New York Times as much they were at least as guilty of bringing this war into reality you know Judy Miller and Michael Gordon famously corrode these pieces falsely you know just horribly sourced pieces falsely claiming that Saddam was building building nukes and then Cheney would go on Cheney's people would hand it to them and then they would publish it in the New York Times and then Cheney would go on face the nation or meet the press and say my god did you read what I just dumped into the New York Times this morning I got to do something about what I just dumped you know I happen to read this thing and my staffer Libby just wrote for me I know it's just amazing Michael Gordon by the way made his chops in Russia too in the 90s I mean again people have forgotten this but Russia in the 90s was the mission of America it was the center of all American policy and it was a catastrophe you know catastrophe on the scale of the catastrophe of Iraq and the next decade I mean it's just it's really unbelievable how much they fuck things up over and over and over um so Gordon goes from Russia reporting hacking to getting us a new war now he's with um the Wall Street Journal I think he was trying to push the idea that Iraq that Iran is close to getting the bomb and you know if we don't do something in three months or six months or whatever the remember there was like a Thomas Friedman time six months Iran has been six weeks from getting the bomb yeah for this entire millennium so far probably before the millennium yeah in fact that was I think the one real regret in nationalist or whatever you want to call them circles in DC that Iraq spent so much of the US military capital and and its literal capital that they couldn't do Iran as well right and some of them even had buyers remorse like I could have had Iran yeah but you know that would have gone a lot worse um oh it would have been believable yeah absolutely nightmare we would yeah we would have lost armies there would have been armies just completely swallowed up yeah New York Times executive editor Bill Keller the I can't believe I'm a hot club right that's it that's what he wrote I can't believe I'm a hot club there's a lot more this is a lot more this coy disingenuous oh I'm such a hawk when did the New York Times meet a war it didn't I know I mean yeah there's this belief they have about themselves that normally I'm a nice guy yes I hate the idea of war that's a lie they've always loved every war that America ever started uh yeah and he he says we reluctant hawks may disagree about ourselves um and yeah it's pro war stance hi I can't help myself what can I do I know you know I I think the reason why you saw some of that with this word you saw some of that with the coast of a war two which like the Susan Sontag's but they were much more um their the rhetoric was like borderline evangelical religious about what a religious imperative it was to support NATO and the coast of a war and it was good versus evil and so on but um but with this one I I think why you'd see this sort of gosh I can't believe I'm being a reluctant hawk here was because deep down they all knew Bush was lying Bushes people were lying I mean their stories were so ridiculous you know and like for me and going to war just seemed absolutely crazy didn't matter whether it was because there were a few mwmds or not or this like I don't I didn't even think that much about I didn't believe the bullshit about a nuclear weapon I didn't really care whether he had some wmds because they weren't going to be able to do with anything with them anyway but I've to admit me I really thought wow this wmd thing is also a giant lie when um powled it is big speech before the UN I don't know if you watched that but I remember watching that being really freaked out like yeah wow this is this is I've never seen any lying like this to like a body like that so blatant in my life I yeah basically we're talking about a and for you know younger viewers we're talking about uh famous testimony where he holds up a little vial of white powder it looked oddly like you know a coke dealer's spiel yes this shit will fuck you up yes that's right I picked this up right in front of a school playground we don't bomb the entire school yeah yeah that's exactly it it was it was bizarre because you also didn't you kind of least expected that from Powell you kind of had a sense that maybe if there's one you know grown up there maybe it will be Powell not that he was a great guy we know about me lying all that stuff but still he had been reluctant about use of force in the past and him doing that it was like holy shit the whole country has gone completely insane and that's a weird scary thing because then you're like well am I going to stand in the way of ins of like this wave of elite insanity and this is elite this is top down people like to like this same crowd likes to warn us about the dangers of populism and the deplorables and you know how dangerous they all are but this this was a slaughter that resulted in millions of people dead and displaced and wounded that was totally top down you know absolutely imposed that's really a point worth making many times yeah that what is the elites reputation the punditocracy's reputation for having better tastes than the the nobody's based on when when were they right about anything they certainly were wildly unapologetically wrong about this and then the next thing they cheered for I guess was Libya that has been an unmitigated disaster yeah although they don't even acknowledge that they sort of in some awkward way acknowledged that Iraq well didn't work out sorry about that but with this is different yeah we're not going to talk about that yeah that's it well and the way they sold it a lot too was this is women meeting it Samantha power and Maurice lotter who also supported the Iraq invasion as did Hillary I don't know about Samantha power but as Susan Rice like the whole thing was sold at least as White House Obama White House people packaged it as the first ever women's led humanitarian war and you know what a great thing that's done for women and it's just unbelievable yeah on the other hand OTOH and there wasn't much of this out there hardly at all John for the exile the Warner one of the first articles so this is July 2002 from issue never 148 you publishes these here comes the dumbass sequel and you know this was when it was starting to dawn on us that you know holy shit they're they're not joking about actually invading Iraq like the one country that had nothing to do with 9-11 to prove something or other and here's you know here's what you write so we're going to go back into Iraq now that this time they have to get rid of Saddam the Israelis for one won't have it any other way and the Bush has made it pretty obvious that with the Israelis once for all I got to admit I'm I was very surprised at the time how much these Israelis are supposed to know the Middle East but they they'd already started getting major brainwarms like they should have known that this war would go bad for us and it should anyway just another more stupidity everywhere no Saddam means crazy Kurds crazy Shiites scared Saudis angry were hobby loonies desperate Palestinians it means we go right up close to the old Hornets nest and hit it again with a big big stick and the stick's not going to be hitting a bubble as the Tom Frenwood is really better boy it sure is hard to predict what'll happen then huh you write the Warner rights and I know the hard part is making up a new happy western Iraq won't happen can't happen anybody who ain't thick as two planks knows that so will they do it are they really that dumb well I can say as I used to live in Bakersfield and I knew a whole lot of Okis who's dads were in the business the all businesses they called it and let me tell you those boys were so goddamn dumb and so goddamn religious they make the Saudis look like little bohemian university people so yeah they're dumb enough they're way way way dumb enough yeah might as well enjoy it I guess there better be a lot of good gun camera shots from the eight tens because the rest of it ain't gonna be much fun I mean I was the first one saying like this is gonna be an incredibly bad idea yeah so anyone really should have known that the United States had been in a lot of guerrilla wars recently in the lead up to this hadn't done very well at any of them but what that really did in the circles that counted was make them not want to think about guerrilla war much because the most amazing thing about the first year of this war is that nobody is preparing for a possible guerrilla war nobody it's like that was a bizarre idea that they laughed off yeah so the the invasion begins March 20th 2003 they move up from the south and the west the first part does indeed go really well they take Baghdad in less than three weeks or that is they occupy Baghdad but that is the easy part and the hard part is figuring out what you've occupied because you don't have anybody who speaks the language the few people you have as Iraqi liaisons are professional liars and spies like Ahmed Tilabi and your your troops are completely blind they don't have any clue what's going on there conditions are obviously ripe for a guerrilla war but all and I mean all the articles all the sound bites were about how do we take Baghdad or what do we do about those Iraqi tanks or those Iraqi planes or those Iraqi artillery pieces nothing about what happens after we occupy the cities the amazing thing is okay March 20th 2003 the war begins may first well okay April 9th American troops take Baghdad and they do that famous toppling of the statue the little photo op which was staged by the way by yeah by the US Army the whole thing was staged by the Syops people but yeah go ahead yeah it's like pointing an M16 at somebody cheer and May 1st 2003 I had no idea this has happened so soon US President George W. Bush goes on an aircraft carrier and declares mission accomplished an end to major combat operations that is basically six weeks after combat operations start mission accomplished no sense that there might be a guerrilla war can I just add here I I'm sure because I remember this was in the back of even my mind I remember you were you were sure but we were both in Moscow at the time doing the exile and you were absolutely sure there was going to be guerrilla warfare and you were sort of drawing on I mean really what you were drawing on also was just everything you had studied and thought about written about you know with Northern Ireland and I'll other examples no I'm not mostly yeah yeah and I was not sure I have to be honest at until I saw it because people thought there was going to be something like that in Kosovo but Kosovo obviously was hugely different hugely different but I know the Kosovo President it's only because there were some people warning about it that if US quote unquote boots on the ground right remember the US NATO didn't put so-called boots on the ground it was all air for the entire war got Yeltsin to sell out Milosevic and that caused the Serbian will to collapse because they had no outside support anymore that was it and so they caved and um but you know huge difference was 90 percent of the population there was ethnic Albanian wanted us there um absolutely wanted so this wasn't like you know so that's already reason number one why it's so massively different from Iraq they actually wanted us there and wanted us to protect them and still like having us there most of them do anyway I mean a good a large enough portion of them do um and and especially because Serbia still exists right next to them and then northern Kosovo is still Serbian controlled mostly um the other another difference is it's so small I mean if you've been to Kosovo it's like this little valley it's like this bowl you know that's so um I mean you could you could keep an eye on every little thing there and and you know the largest US base at least in the world at the time camp bond steel was built there and all the NATO allies had bases so it was just it it but I think to the political people who thought at that time we know better than the military people it was like ah they said that about Kosovo and there was no problem there's not going to be a problem here because everybody just wants to be us anyway the hit you know history is ended we are the end of history everybody except for a few dead enders wants to be us anyway yeah it's like the quote from full metal jacket where the guy famously says to Matthew Moody inside of every G.O.K. is an American trying to get out and that that really was the thinking of people and I think all the liberals who who supported hugely supported the Kosovo war weren't like they just deferred to them I think they didn't they didn't know or believe in a in a guerrilla war either because it seemed obvious to everybody that everybody wants to be American um yeah you know and all that happy note we'll stop here I'm that up a note I guess we can stop here and then we can continue because we have a whole bunch of people um we want to deserving targets yeah as deserving targets people whose quotes we want to get out there big small and in between so we'll do that in the next episode right yep all right good all right thanks uh John Brennan thanks everyone thanks everybody see you bye",
