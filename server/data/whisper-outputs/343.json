    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. The day today is August 24th, 2022. And this is episode 343. Because Mark Ames, I am currently in Los Angeles, California. And I'm in line with Warner, Gary Brecher, AK John Dolan, John U are in. And I'm in a hotel because we still can't get reliable Wi-Fi. It all depends on getting a code of Chiffee Scale. And you can't get that until you get an appointment with the local authorities. And that takes quite a while, quite a while longer than we expected. But yeah, I had an amazing Warner to re moment a couple of days ago. I've found out belatedly that everybody in my Italian conversation class was supposed to give another presentation. And I hadn't realized that. So I thought, OK, I'll talk about the war in Tigray. And I'll open by talking about Adwo, the Battle of Adwo in 1896, in which an Italian army was destroyed by the Ethiopians, which was an epic event. And I know that this has made an impact in parts of Italy because I've been in a little hilltop town in Piemonte, where there were many, many graves for people who died at Adwo. And so I thought, here's a way to segway it, to find a link with the audience as we are taught. I said, you know, so who has seen the big hotel that is called Albeda Guadua? And nobody had even though it's right down the street. And then who here knows about the Battle of Adwo? Blank, total blank. Absolutely nobody knew about the Battle of Adwo. And what was more alarming from a trusting, war-neared perspective is nobody wanted to know. It sounded like a bad thing. And nobody was interested. And I was shocked. I actually thought about photocopying something in Italian about the Battle of Adwo and handing it out the next day. But I thought that might seem a little presumptuous. I'm on thin ice in that conversation class anyway. Because I say things that are not quite the dumb thing. Hey, let's talk about a big defeat here. Who's with me? I guess there's that. Yeah, well, it's their problem. So yeah, today, well, today we're going to be talking about the partition, the India Pakistan partition, which we have just passed up to 75th anniversary. Before we wanted to just talk about a couple of recent sort of events, right? One, I mean, just the Ukraine War, the general story around the Ukraine War, and also the stabbing of the attempted assassination. Well, basically two assassination attempts. Yeah. The assassination attempt on Salman Rushdie and the successful assassination of Alexander Dugin's daughter, Darya Duginna. I don't know which one do you want to start off with? I want to talk about Darya Duginna because apparently they're claiming there's a suspect now. Yes. Who's the suspect? So the suspect is they've named there. They had the goods on are apparently like within a day in Russian. They have SB start releasing us to the local media. Her name is Natalia Volk. She is a parent. I think she's 43 early 40s. I think she's originally from Mariupal and her son. I believe it was born in Mariupal. This is all that's coming out through various media and like Strona, the Ukrainian site that's in Russian language. Usually, so I can read it as Strona Noir and also some Russian language sites. And then I think through the some English language media. Anyway, the Russians are saying that she was already on a list. So they produce a copy of her, with just the video. What's her name again? Volk. Volk. V-O-V-K. Is that an unusual name? It is. It seems. Yeah. Her other last name is Shaban and her children's last name is Shaban, which I believe was her husband or ex-husband's last name. She served in the National Guard and the Russians had claimed she was associated with the Azov, the notorious Azov battalion regiment people. The Ukrainians deny that though they say she is a real person. You know, they released video showing her. I mean, it's pretty clear she was there. What her role was. Like all these things, it's so damn murky. Somehow she got in. She was there at the assessment. She got into Russia for this operation with her daughter through the breakaway Donetsk peoples republed like the DNR. Came in wound up renting a place in Dadya, Duganah's building. And that's they released sort of camera footage like door ring doors sort of footage of her in sort of late July. And then left the day of the assassination with her daughter. And I saw like video sort of, you know, Russian border guard video looking through the cars she was leaving and so on. And the Russians are saying that she was the spy who carried it out. And it may or may not be true. The Ukrainians deny it. So she's not claiming that there was she was a friend of Darya Duganah. No, no, not at all. But so she and her husband, so her husband or ex-husband, maybe it was her husband's name, Wolf, actually, or ex-husband, Wolf. He apparently is from the Donbass area and may have even been associated with Donbass militias. I mean, you have to understand there's a lot of murky interlinking here. One could be she was mistaken for, let's say she was, I mean, she clearly had some role in this. I'd say the very good chance she had some role. She may have been mistaken for either somebody from the Russian occupied regions or maybe even maybe through her husband associated with pro-Russian militias. The other thing is, you know, as of battalion, I mean, old, old, as of like old far right Ukrainian links to Dugan are a lot stronger than I kind of knew. I mean, Alexei Otostovich, for example, is sort of the most quoted guy of Zelensky spoke people. The West loves this guy. He used to be a Duganist. You kind of started. Wow. And it was crazy, isn't he? And yeah, I mean, there are a lot of these ex-Duganists because there are a lot of sort of far right nationalists that are sort of in power one way or another now. In Ukraine, in their earlier days, they were very anti-NATO and they're always anti-liberal. So they weren't really for the orange revolution. But then they started kind of linking up with the liberals more like after Yanukovych took power. So that really, like that stronger. So the common denominator was Ukrainian nationalism then? Yes. Ukrainian nationalism. So here you had Ukrainians mixing in. I mean, and then of course, security services spy agencies mix up with far right groups like this because, well, for obvious reasons. And, you know. So my question is this, if she is the bomber and I think there's a good chance she had to roll in it, who gave her the bomb? I mean, this is a big bomb. I can't, you know, I guess there's a chance. I mean, Ukrainian SBU is pretty good. They've already managed to poison like the collaborationist governor, Russian pro-Russian, whatever installed governor of your son. You know, they've pulled off some car bombings. But getting in, you know, you'd have to win an operation. That would be, what do you do? You sort of, I don't know. You paste it underneath the car that's used to come in or on your daughter or something like, I don't know how you get this material in. Well, yeah, it's kind of scary that she brought her 12 year old daughter with her. Yeah. I suppose that's dedication. I mean, if everybody survives, you might get a promotion, but she could have been a patty too. I know. I don't know. Has anyone helped you pack your bags? Yeah. Is there anything in it that has wires coming out of it? It looks like modeling clay. But my question as someone who knows a lot less than you do is why? Why Daria Duke and I wasn't in an attempt to get her father? And if so, why? Because he's not very central to any of this. So the FSB says they were actually targeting the daughter. And I don't know exactly why they say that. Maybe because they, it's thought that they knew that Duke and so they were at some one of these grim traditional conferences or on tradition or whatever that very day. And Alexander Dugan, the father who is a very famous far right mystical, crypto fascist writer. I had sort of met him. I definitely saw him at Le Mans of bunker back in the 90s when he was with Le Mans of. I've seen this guy and he didn't fit in very well. And they didn't last very long. Dugan thought Le Mans of was two left wing, two anarchists, two left wing Le Mans of thought he was. I don't know. As I remember, you got to tell that story about the war hall. And now. Yeah. So Le Mans of bunker was this notorious. Well, probably in the 2000s as well. But certainly in the 90s, it was like a gathering place for sort of punks, gotts, metal heads. Everybody was sort of anti liberal in one way or another. And you know, it was they'd have music, they'd have art. And Dugan would sort of give lectures, try to give lectures there. And people would just sit there and kind of look at him with sort of like, you know, confused dog faces like because. And I'll, I'll, I'll remember Le Mans of saying about him. He speaks nine languages and he talks about Gog and Magog or Og and Magog and it was just mystical crap that was so uninteresting to me. But I think from Le Mans of point of view, Le Mans of I think was very influenced by his experience in New York in the 70s and by the world scene and Lou Reed and Velvet Underground, all that kind of stuff. And that's what he told me and and then punk. And he just for his point of view, the party and the bunker like, you know, he founded it also with the Agro Litz of the singer of Grosz\u00e1n Cabar\u00f3n, I like the greatest punk band in history. And he didn't last long Le Mans of and then Dugan eventually left. Dugan was just a gas bag. I don't know how kind of this crypto fascist gas bag. I'll never understand why he's taken so seriously and I never knew he was taken seriously until five or six years ago. You started hearing Western Russia experts saying this guy is Putin's brain, which is just for I mean, imagining Putin spending five minutes with this weirdo. Putin is like a dark nasty bad guy all in his own for his own reasons. Has nothing to do with Dugan's bizarre mystical dreams about Gog and McGog or whatever that was going on. Look, this Gog McGog, can you put on one page? I mean, I imagine I do one page, Melmos. Exactly. Imagine Putin with that button, you know, where you draw the person who's talking to you. Like, he's not Putin's brain. He's nowhere near Putin's brain. I doubt that from what I understand, they never even met and Putin's met almost everybody. Like, it's just a weirdo. But what I would say about Dugan, maybe he even learned this from Le Mans of Dugan is a great self promoter. And he promoted the idea that was also very deeply believed in Western think tanks, natal ant think tanks, Russia experts, and among Ukrainian nationalist and sort of liberal nationalists that Dugan is like, you can't just be that Putin is the one who's thinking up this invasion. You got to have a Spengali because that's that completes the picture of Russia as this weird alien force, right? Like, it just can't be that Putin is doing this. It's got to be some really, really bad guy behind the scenes who's eyes light with fire or something. Dugan plays that role pretty well. And I think Dugan has helped create through his PR, this reality, where he did become an important figure, an important ideological pillar of the war in people's minds. And that's led to real consequences, you know? And his daughter is just a chip off the old block. You saw that clip of her talking to some French far right site, right? And French is also very good like her father's. She just, I mean, from what I was from my broken French, she basically is just a pro-Putin, you know, anti-European anti-liberal, right? I mean, it's just kind of standard stuff. I don't think she was that big of a deal though. I just can only think either they made a mistake. I mean, if they had killed Alexander Dugan, I think that would be a pretty big deal. Well, yeah, he's certainly a big name. And in that way, it would prove their power even as he didn't really matter that much. That's one of the irony of promoting yourself like exactly your worth killing. Yeah. I don't know why. It's a good question. I don't know why they would specifically set out to target her and not him. Now, there are, you know, there are a thousand conspiracy theories going around to, both on the Russian side and a Ukrainian side. And they basically come down to Russian elements, did this themselves, either Putin signed off on it. They're actual think tankers who are taken seriously in the West who argue that Dugan himself organized it because he believes that he's probably in one of his, inane, you know, screeds he wrote that the elite should be ready to sacrifice their children. You know, one of his mystical things talking about sacrifice. I'll go first. Yeah, I just don't buy that. No, no, no, no. It's it's, I mean, look, I'll grant that anything in the world is possible. But we have to go with what is most likely and try and be as much as I hate Occam's razoring, you know, you do have to try to Occam's razor here. And, you know, we've seen that Ukraine as has been more and more frustrated on the battlefield has turned to more spectacular kind of behind the lines attacks with a lot of success, too. In Crimea, taking out collaborators in Russian occupied Ukraine and something like this would be like, like somebody said, some of you kind of tried to write a pro-Ukrain version of this said, if this conspiracy theory that the Ukrainians themselves and a lot of their backers are promoting, which is the FSB organized this in order to rally the country for a more determined war and, you know, go harder in the war, which I don't even know what the hell that means. You can't even call it a war in Russia. Like, there's no descent in Russia right now. So I don't know why you need that. All it does is show weakness on the regime's part. You can have a bombing like this right near Urubliovka, John, you know, this is like, yeah, this was right near sort of the Beverly Hills of the Russian, you know, the Kremlin elite, the Russian elite. This is not a stabilize. This is not, this is meant to destabilize. And it is destabilizing. So I don't know why this would be an inside job. So as far as you know, Duget herself wasn't involved in anything big or well, she was a spoke, she was a promoter of the war. She was, she was pro war. Right, but she was a mouthpiece, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, she was a mouthpiece. She was a, she was more sort of respectable looking, you know, and respectable kind of face than her dad, but, but a minor figure really. I just, this was targeted at the father, whether it was meant to kill him or meant to sort of drive him crazy. It was definitely targeted at the father because of his influence, both real and massively inflated, but because the inflated sense of his importance is his own reality. It is, it's an important hit. And you know, as I can say, it's pretty spectacular. But my big question again is, how did, how did they get the bomb in? And this is like, this is a really serious bombing. And it would be pretty amazing if this Natalia Volv did the entire thing all by herself. I think she switched cars, switched number plates. There was a lot of like, there's a lot of stuff going on that would strongly imply there other people inside the country helping out. And what that means is, you know, anybody's question. When we talk about the FSB and the SBU, presumably, we're talking about people who used to know each other and work together. Yes, yes. Yes. So penetrated, deeply penetrated. Yes. Yes. So there's probably a lot of mutual interaction there. And people are still bribeable like, hey, we were at the same station. You want to make $2 million, okay? It's quite possible. I mean, and I doubt we're going to find out because the Ukrainians are going to deny it because because it was the daughter that was killed. And they kind of like Pope Francis just came out and said something effective, you know, that it was bad and wrong. Yeah, but actually there's been, I don't want to harp on this, but I was expecting this and had no trouble finding it. She had it coming sort of. Oh, yeah. Yes. She had it coming. She was that bad guy. It's daughter. And you got a lot of that. There is a lot of that. And, you know, there are a lot of people in the world far more worth grieving over than her. I'll grant that. But like, there was nevertheless, there's a little bit of unease about it. There is a little bit of unease because she was young and pretty and, you know, not these things. You can't say she was a central figure in the ideology of, you know, genocide against Ukraine. Like, you just can't say that. So I think if it blew up her father, the gloating and the celebrating zone would be much more open. And, you know, I bet you the Ukrainians would have been, would have released one of their kind of trademark snarky, you know, tweets about, you know, be careful while driving or something like that. And, you know, like that clip from Starship Troopers, Putin's brain. It's afraid. In fact, it's dispersed. Yeah. Yes. So, yeah. So that's, I mean, I have a feeling we're going to get just an endless hall of mirrors story from this. As you do with so many kind of spooky operations, well, and I seriously doubt that Bellencat will devote its resources to outing the entire Ukrainian operation, assuming it is a Ukrainian operation, which I do assume that. So, you know, so we're just going to be stuck with the Merc, I think. The other thing in Ukraine that I would just bring up briefly, Ukraine passed this law. I mean, I think I've talked about in the past, you know, that while this war has been going on, it's, it's re-arranged some of the politics within Zelensky's government. And it's really empowered. And it seems counterintuitive, but it has the hardcore free market neoliberal wing, which wasn't a dominant wing when Zelensky came to power at all as far as I know. Or to some, maybe to some degree, but it was kind of, wishy-washy, I guess, would be a better way to put it. They just passed, they just, Zelensky just signed off on a law. It's law 5371 that strips most workers of their rights to collective bargaining and basically the law is designed so that every worker is liberated from unions and allowed to negotiate one-on-one with their employers. It's one of the most radical anti-labor laws in the whole world and they just passed it. Wow. It's bad. It's just part of the payoff for getting US help. I, you know, as far as I understand, the EU is actually bothered by this. And it's out of line with EU law, which they're supposed to be going in line with as they've made their application. I think a lot of this comes, I think it's sort of the logic of anti-communism, which is anti-Russianism and anti-communism are one in that country and sort of in the purification of that. And the NGO class tends to be very, very neoliberal in a lot of these countries and they've been much more empowered since the war started. Because all the garks have been disempowered because they've had their assets blown up, you know, taken away. And so I don't know. I think this is mostly an internal thing. There's also a massive new privatization drive that's going on. I mean, it's like, it's real shock doctrine. Now to bring this up, I brought this up and I saw somebody attack me, saying, you're justifying Russia's war. It's like, not justifying Russia's war for Christ's sake. I find this just gruesome as hell that you respond to a country attacking and arguing, killing your citizens by stripping your workers of rights. It's hard to, it's just brutal. I don't even see that argument like you object to a Ukrainian anti-union law that proves you're a Russian backer that doesn't make a sensible sense. It's just where we're at right now. Really briefly, the attempt at assassination of Salman Rushdie a couple of weeks ago. Well, yeah, it was like a strange commemoration of partition because Rushdie became famous in the West at least, a multi-famous author because of midnight's children, which is about children who are born right at the moment of partition and who acquire magical powers. You can tell it's sort of based on Rushdie's own life because he was born as I recall a couple of months before partition. This won the booker prize of booker prizes. I liked it. I thought it was pretty good. Rushdie has endless invention, which can be a problem for some writers too. Midnight's children introduces this whole pamphoon of God-like children who create their own telepathic parliament and go through adventures which are sometimes heavily signposted as symbolic of the Indian predicament and the post-colonial predicament. Then he got in trouble for satanic verses which came out I think in 1988 and there was a fatwa against him. A very distinctive 20th century fatwa from the era when the Ayatollah in Tehran was considered the voice of militant Islam and that fatwa originated with Khomeini and Rushdie famously went into hiding with SAS bodyguards and handlers and nothing happened to him. And then at a talk in the writer's colony upstate New York at Chautauqua, he was attacked about a few weeks ago and stabbed in the neck in the eye. Lever. Yeah, Lever. Sounds pretty gruesome. By a guy, I think his name was Hattar who was from a Shia background in Lebanese family but raised in New Jersey which always has a punchline sound to him. And who basically took to his basement after visiting Levinon and decided he needed to become more religious and so he stabbed someone Rushdie. So it was a weird reawakening of a story that had been dead for decades. John, I don't know about you. I mean, I don't mean to talk bad of somebody. I admire Rushdie because I don't know, he took it really well. But I remember this was a huge deal, you know, 30 years ago when the Fattwa was issued on him and it was just, well, anyway, I read or I bought satanic verses then and tried reading it and it's probably I shouldn't have started with that novel because you've told me that midnight children is actually a really good novel. But I did not think satanic verse, I didn't like it at all actually. No, I didn't like it at all either. I mean, and not because of like the offense, I mean, it may have been offensive to Muslims, I'm not sure, but I just, I didn't like that, that literary, I don't know that, that ironic, hyperliterary voice in it, it just kind of, it just graded. Yeah, it was the kind of, I mean, the, the height of magical realism when it works to me is the master and margarita. I mean, that's, you, you see things that couldn't possibly happen and you believe them. But satanic verses was somebody was writing like, like a writer who's already famous and writing as they say with tongue in cheek and I don't think you can do that technique with tongue in cheek. You, you got to believe and then, then it went into, uh, what I took to be Bollywood gossip. I didn't, I didn't understand why. I mean, maybe in, if you're Indian, it makes more sense, but it was like backstage gossip. I didn't get it. Isn't that like, there was a lot of that sort of what they called then postmodern, high and low, you know, it was sort of like watch me a high intellectual, dabbling in low culture as well. It's just, I'd say graded me wrong, but I do understand he's written a lot of other really good stuff. So I don't want to, I just want to say that novel I didn't like, you know, no, there's a, there's a short story that I remembered when, when this happened to him, I was called the prophet's hair and it's one of his Kashmiri stories. And he writes really well about Kashmir. He wrote really well in a children's book he, he did called a Haroon in the Sea of Stories. And the prophet's hair is about a real episode in Kashmir where someone steals a relic that's supposed to be a hair from the head of the prophet. He imagines what happens to it in the house of this do or devout Kashmiri. It's pretty amazing. So that's what we'll stick to. Okay. Anyway, he's recovering. So that's good. I mean, it's, you know, it's, there's a nasty story and he's recovering and hopefully he'll recover fine. But at this point, we want to get to the topic at hand today, which is the 1947 partition of the Indian subcontinent into India and Pakistan. Since we've just passed the 75th anniversary of one of the bloodiest, most tragic, horrible events of the 20th century, which are good friends, the British played no small role in that. And as usual, God always cut freaks. It's just amazing. At least if you read the English world, the Anglo world accounts. As I understand it in India, it's pretty common knowledge. I'm not sure about Pakistan, actually, but certainly in India, it's pretty common knowledge that the Brits deliberately set the stage for the horror that followed with the partition. But not when you read the accounts in the BBC and NPR, I went and listened to, tried to listen to various podcasts that I could find on like Apple Podcast apps. And just almost everyone takes the view that poor Britain was exhausted after the war. And you know, things got out of their control. They couldn't hold it back anymore. They had no agency in this whatsoever. It was their lack of agency that caused this. Yeah, while it's extraordinary, but you know, we keep seeing the same pattern. But this is probably their biggest public relations triumphs. And who knows how long it will last? I had said before, I have great faith in the South Asian intelligentsia. They're a really formidable group. And they're poking holes in this pretty steadily. And I think 20 years from now, things will be seen a little differently. But of course, you don't have to maintain a PR offensive like that forever. It just needs to work for a while. It needs to work for your lifetime. And if they blame you a century later, so what? It's a lot more effort to overturn a deeply embedded narrative. Yes. I mean, once you've said a narrative, like you have to go against a lot of common knowledge, you have to convince people who will be prone to rolling their eyes for a while. And you know, it's this effort. So yeah. Well, yeah, there are two other factors. One of them is the Indian intelligentsia has a perfectly reasonable component of people who say, can we stop talking about that? Let's deal with what happened last week in Mumbai or something. And I absolutely understand that. You want to stop dwelling on the wrongs of the past. There are a lot of analogs in other cultures that have been colonized. It's an understandable impulse, but it can be a really destructive impulse at the same time. It's dangerous. And the other thing is that I think we need to mention is of all the horrors unleashed by the Nazis. One of the greatest and least appreciated is that there had been in the 1920s a real awakening of conscience in Europe about colonialism. And there were British intellectuals saying what we have done in India is going to be a stain on our history for centuries. And it probably would have been except that the Nazis came along and it was their mission as they saw it to be so god-awful that they kind of wiped clean everybody else's sins. Yes, for quite a long time. It's funny. You could see a smaller version of that in our lifetime. I mean, it was for a while at least common knowledge that the Neocons and Bush and Cheney and these people were criminals who had created havoc and misery and death everywhere. The worst things, even the right had come to that conclusion. And then Trump comes along and suddenly everybody sins are washed because Trump is worse. Suddenly, Bill Crystal is the new MSNBC go-to guy. You know, Dan. Well, and Cheney's daughter is a change. Cheney's daughter. I mean, you know, that's a much smaller version of it, but in case you need to look at something closer to home like how this can happen. Yeah, but you're right. Those death camp photos pretty much absolved everybody for a long time. To talk about partition, I think we have to go back to the beginning of Indian agitation. I mean, we can't really simply do that because we'd have to talk about the so-called mutiny of 1857 and what led up to it and what followed it. What followed it basically were a lot of massacres that were that are only now being discovered and a lot of repression and a very big change in the way the the Raj, the empire saw itself in relation to the Indian population. There were a lot of British officials in the Raj who admittedly in a patronizing way, but nonetheless quite seriously became big fans of Indian culture, Indian religions and mixed freely with at least the upper classes of Indian society under colonization. Here the defeat of the insurgency, the mutiny, the Raj took a very different view and became much more conservative. And it's kind of important to remember that because things don't always get more liberal as they go. They can go right in a big way and the Raj went right in a big way. And the idea of the British colonist as someone who celebrated intellectual mediocrity, celebrated groupthink and being a team player and not going native, not entertaining any thoughts that mixed any anti-Raj opinions, that's a product to some extent of the reaction to the so-called mutiny. But that made for a colonial regime that was a lot harder to bear than its earlier versions and that led to the development of resistance. Right. A couple of other things I just wanted to say about it. First of all, we did an excellent episode. Well, because we had a great guest, I should say. I mean, not that we're not excellent, John. Yeah, we're excellent enough. But we did an episode 103 on the 1857. It's known in the Anglo world as the mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the support mutiny. It's known in India as the rebellion. It was the beginning of the war against colonialism, the Indian war against colonialism. But the other, so that's episode 103 with a GT of Ella Valley. The other thing I wanted to say is that, you know, the India up to 1857 had been at least officially under the rule of a private for-profit state-aligned company, the British East Indian company. So, and after the rebellion of 1857, which is John said, was savagely put down with as much intentional public savagery as you would expect and you would read about and see woodcuts of, you know, from the Middle Ages or something. They didn't take as many photos this time, but man, they went. They were as deliberately public, brutal, savagely, you know, famously tying suspected mutineers to the ends of cannons and firing the cannons and all this, you know, bodies hanging from gallows everywhere. Yeah, thousands of villages were burnt. Those villages were just forgotten. Right. But after that, the, the Raj was formally taken over by the state, by the British state that is to say. So it became a formal call. It was already essentially a colony and had become increasingly a formal state colony not under the nominal rule of this private company for quite a while. But after this, it was just sort of decided that British East Indian company can't handle this anymore. And so it formally became, you know, a colony. And also around this time in 1857, we're talking about for the next 100 years or so, really we're talking about the peak of, I mean, it's the early part, but really the rising peak of the whole hardcore white supremacist, Aryan, psycho babble, sort of social Darwinist psycho babble. So, you know, which becomes a kind of ideology of British colonialism, I mean, not just the British, but particularly the British. And so that should also give you a sense that things weren't going to become more liberal. They were definitely becoming harsher, crueler, the famines, the artificial famines that the British oversaw became deadlier, you know, after the Raj, after the government took over. Yeah, it's funny. You should say that about the change in tone. Just a little aside here. We're staying at a town called Tropea in Calabria. And as you walk across town, there's a little bust that sticks out of the wall by the sidewalk. And it feels vaguely familiar. And then you think, oh, the guy's wearing a Ranger hat and he's really skinny and he looks kind of grim and serious. It's Bautin Powell, the founder of the Scouting Movement, who is another one of these beginning of the 20th century creations and a very strange man. One of, well, a guy who fits in right there with Curson. The typical product of the Raj at the beginning of the 20th century, who exemplified that more insane, more militant tone of the late empire was Lord Curson. He was appointed Vice Roy of India in 1899. So he just comes in at the beginning of the 20th century. The thing to remember about Curson and a lot of the people who ruled India and who are influential in the high of circles of Imperial Britain is that they were, they would be considered insane by current standards. And I know these, this is a sliding scale. I grew up before anybody was autistic. So now I hear things and it's like, well, yeah, but half of my school, but I, anyway, so Curson. A spectrum of craziness. Let's say this is on the farther end of the spectrum of craziness. Right, right. Curson would make anybody's list. His parents were prolific. They had about a dozen kids and paid no attention at all to them, which was quite common. That's nothing unusual. But it meant they were put in the hands of their nurses who became extremely important figures in their lives. And I'll just read an excerpt from Curson's experience. An influential presence in Curson's childhood was that of his brutal, sadistic governess, Ellen Mary Paramann, whose tyranny in the nursery stimulated his combative qualities and encouraged his obsession side, the obsession side of his nature, which is roughly turned in completely crazy. Paramann used to beat him and periodically forced him to parade through the village, wearing a conical hat, bearing the words, liar, sneak, and coward. And it's good thing he didn't have internet porn to search. Yeah. Yeah. So Curson in 1901, soon after he had been appointed to the rule of British India, said it quite plainly, because people had not learned to be coy about their real beliefs in some ways. Quote, as long as we rule India, we are the greatest power in the world. If we lose it, we shall drop straight away to a third great power. So that's the practical aspect of this. There's no nonsense about the white man's burden as Kipling was want to wax, lyrical about. It's just we need this place and we'll do anything to hold on to it. But meanwhile, there's this big class of educated, ambitious, ethnically Indian people who are very unhappy about growing up inside this more intensely right wing, Raj, which sees them as people to be feared. And they have their own, many of them were from Bengal. Bengal was a highly literate, highly airy-dyed area of India. And they felt that something had to be done. It was not easy to do anything about this. We've said this in many other contexts before. People have succumbed to the Hugh Grant delusion of Britain as just a cute little side show. No, Britain seemed immovable and just unbeatable in every way. So they weren't quite sure how to go about it. And most of them ruled out armed rebellion because that had been tried and the results were, as Mark said, horrific. So in the 1880s, there's a lot of stuff going on around the empire. There are a lot of weird connections between Ireland and India. Parnell is working the land league in Ireland, trying to use a combination of parliamentary intrigue and basically blackmail to what would be the word to metal fatigue the empire into making concessions. And India does some of the same things. And this culminates in the Swaraj, meaning self-rule movement. The Indian National Congress, which becomes the Congress party, is founded in the 1880s. Very moderate organization from upper class people, many of them Bengali, others, Maratha. All they want is an end to discrimination and employment, like India should get the same money for the same jobs. You should plow back some of the money we're sending to London into educating our kids here in India. And maybe you could stop taxing the peasantry to death. Very ordinary common sense demands. And the response to this under a crore zone is a really, really deadly precedent. And that's the partition of Bengal in 1905. It's weird, Mark. Most people don't know about this. I never heard of it. You told me in an email and I was like, what partition of Bengal? Yeah. And I think to set it up too, you should sort of emphasize how Bengal, Calcutte, like that was the crown jewel, right? I mean, that was the crown jewel within the crown jewel, whatever the jewel within the crown jewel. Like that was really the heart of the Raj. Yes. And it had been for a long time. I mean, Calico comes from Calico comes, you know, and the weaving industries there, the textile industries, I think of Opium. A lot of that was done from there too, which was the key to the whole 19th century. Yeah. That the opium to addict all of China. China through there. But part of that was a little of the money filtered down and it did create this highly educated intelligentsia. And when you inadvertently create an argument while not on a runes, a class like that, it is going to start having ideas of its own. And Swadraj, self-rule. I guess Raj has in kingdom and Swad's in self. That's so interesting. I'm sorry because of the whole Indo-European language. You know, there are just these words every now and then that will echo in the European languages and Swad at Swoi in Russian would be sort of self, right? Or Raj. Yes. Or Regicide Raj. You know, right. Yes. Sorry. There's a great old benchly article with a fake chain of words in the Indo-European tradition. He claims to be tracing the descent of the word dish towel from the Sanskrit dish told. That's great. So the empire at this era has to keep expanding, has to keep moving out, creating more colonies for the second sons back home who don't have jobs. And basically it keeps doing that until the until 1914, 1914 is an unbelievable shock for the empire and for the rest of Europe too. But for example, at the end of 1903, Lord Kurson probably still smarting from his experience in the cart with a cap that says dunce on it, being driven through the village by his nurse, decides and I can never get over this, decides to invade Tibet. Now the rationalization for this was always, always, always Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. And Russia was about to take Tibet and then suddenly descend on India, which was utter nonsense. The Russia Empire was going to be defeated by Japan in 1905. So the idea that they could manage to defeat the British Empire in India was just ridiculous. But it did serve as a justification for invading Tibet. Kurson appointed a very strange and unpleasant man called Francis Younghusband to lead the advance and Younghusband basically provoked a Tibetan force which was using matchlock muskets, which actually had to have a little piece of burning fiber that you applied to the gunpowder and massacred them with maximum guns. And it was starting to get a little ridiculous even for the public at home. And they decided to sweep that one under the rug. They killed many thousands of Tibetans, but they didn't celebrate it much. Yeah, I remember when you wrote about this for the exile, I was so surprised. And I went to Tibet, God, where did they not fuck the world up and leave a trail of blood? And I think maybe it was even in that article. Maybe because I even said that while we were putting the issue together and I read your draft, and I was like, what even Tibet? But you said, you had this great line as a warner. It was something like take a globe, one of these desktop globes, spin it, and then stop it with your finger. And chances are if the fingers stopped anywhere in the land, the British killed people, they're massacred people there. And then you told the story of the Tibet massacre. Yeah, it was such an improbable thing. I think even the jingoists tabloids in London thought, what the hell? Tibet. So they came back to Tibet became officially part of China again. That got complicated. And they decided to do something much more practical. The question became not just where can we expand, but whoa, there's this Bengali intelligence here that is talking about swaraj, self-rule. We better start focusing on holding on to this. So Kurson comes up with this horrific and yet horribly brilliant idea to take Bengali society, which had not been sectarian for the most part and divide it into provinces which we're going to be organized in Muslim or Hindu areas. So they do that. The Raj has the power to do that by Fiat. Okay, Bengali is now divided. This is the Muslim East Bengal area and this is the Hindu West Bengal area. But the Indians, specifically the Congress movement, which was pretty powerful by this time, saw what was going on. And they said, no, no, no, no, no, no, you can't do this. It's a very bad precedent, which it was. And they started resisting. This is when they came up with a movement that went along with swadesh, swaraj, which was swadeshi, which I would guess means self-made, homemade stuff. Right. Wasn't that also sort of the boycott? I mean, isn't that sort of, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it goes along with boycott. If we can't make it for ourselves, we don't buy it from them. I think we've mentioned in other episodes that there's an Indian economist named Patniak and she's done a lot of research into how the empire squeezed money out of India. And I mean, I'm not claiming to understand her theory completely. In fact, we should ever own as a guest if we can get her. But basically the idea seems to be they turned all of India into a company town where you had to buy things at company store prices. And you could only pay in company script. And that enabled Britain, according to her calculations, to take $45 trillion out of India in the time. Right. The taxes were essentially, were just wealth extraction. It basically, company wealth extraction for the shareholders of the British East India Company. I mean, yeah, there were a lot of ways. So within that $45 trillion, I mean, it sounds like so much because you think, how can you actually loot? You imagine people loading gold bricks on an old boat or something like that. It's the wealth destruction and transfer that was done. For example, by destroying India's textile. And it was probably the global leader in textile manufacturing when the British pirates basically first came there. And eventually what they did to turn it to force the Indians, like you said, as a company town, to force them to buy British textiles. They also had to wipe out the local textile industry. And I think they famously, everybody involved the workers and the artisans involved in the textile industry would have their thumbs or parts of their hands cut off. I remember it's like the Belgians did later to the Congolese, but they so that they couldn't do it. They couldn't manufacture. So they reorganized, rearranged the whole domestic economy also towards away from various agriculture towards only cultivating opiums so that they had a good, they can add the Chinese width so that they had something the Chinese needed so that they could buy Chinese spice. I mean, the whole thing is so gruesome, but they reorganized the entire economy and shifted wealth, where did all that wealth shift and go back to the home country. Yeah. You may have seen the importance of the spinning wheel in photos of Gandhi. And this has to do with trying to overcome that imposition of foreign textiles on what had once been a great textile making power. And there were mass burnings of British clothes. But at the same time, the partition was in danger of taking effect. So the great Bengali intellectual of the time, Ravindranath Tagora, made a big public display of tying the rocky, the sacred thread to the arms of everyone he passed in the street. And he made a point of going into a mosque and tying this thread, which was part of the Hindu marriage ceremony, promising protection for life to the risks of Muslim clerics who are absolutely in agreement with this because nobody wanted this to happen except a few people closely connected with the British. But the precedent unfortunately worked. They did create a lasting divide. And this is obviously one of the partitions of the early 20th century. They were doing similar things in Ireland and in many other countries. But there was an element of class to this as well. There were a lot of Hindu landlords and Muslim peasants in Bengal. And it was very possible to arouse class hatred along religious lines. And that of course always prevents anybody from developing any better political awareness. But in the short term, the Congress activist won and the partition of Bengal was erased in 1911. It was a big defeat for Kursal. So in 1906, just after the partition of Bengal, the big Muslim political organization is founded in Bengal, the all-India Muslim League. This was by a group of, quote, men of property and influence in North India. And it was going to continue to be a political force from wealthy Muslims primarily. And the idea here was that Muslims are a threatened minority. A lot of Hindus like to go, we're going to great lengths to make it clear that they would not be a threatened minority. Like a lot of religious groups that had controlled the state, which Muslims had in North India before most of North India, before the British came. It's very easy to create a feeling of threat of the idea that we are losing power as a community. And we are going to be dominated by the people who were once our subjects. So they fight for separate Muslim political electorates. And this sets another really bad precedent. But the worst of it comes as it did for many societies that were colonized by Britain during the war, the Great War, as they called it now. In 1914 to 1918, many hundreds of thousands of Indians were used as combat troops by the British Empire. In fact, I'm writing a newsletter about the memoir, now sold as Palou by a French soldier. Who describes whole towns in southern France being closed so that people won't gawk at the Indian soldiers who are being passed through to the front. And this was a deal between the French and British armies. But those people were recruited in India. And there was a tremendous effort in all the colonies to make the colonies more patriotic. And they were told again and again, we are fighting for the rights of small nations. We are fighting for people like you. And in many cases, it went along with the idea, if you help us now in this war, we will give you home rule, swarage, when the war is over. That led to a, another parallel with Ireland here, that led to a big split in Irish nationalist opinion. The guy named Redmond accepted that promise and led a bunch of people to their deaths in the war. Others refused to accept it. You can actually hear this in the songs from the era. There's fighting in Dublin to be done, let your sergeants and your commanders go. That is go to go to France. Anti-recruiting songs like Arthur McBride, which is too long to recite here. It's a comic interaction between two brothers who go for a walk on the beach and run into a recruiting sergeant and a drummer and a sergeant. They have a big comic fight. They throw the sword and the drum in the ocean. Anyway, so there were parallels to this in India. The war was chewing up soldiers. The empire had never had to deal with some enemies who were at least as well trained and well armed as they were. The casualties were appalling and they were just desperate for bodies. This is the beginning of a split between Hindu and Muslim Indian leaders. There's a long pattern of Hindu resistance to this idea of stay with us now and we'll pay you off later. Muslim willingness to go along with it. We had talked before the show with our friend of the show at DC Villa Valley a bit about how the 1857 rebellion slash mutiny also influenced this split. Because a lot of the soldiers that were mass and people that were massacred by the British afterwards, they were Muslim. There were a lot of Muslim soldiers and a lot of upper class Hindu officers, Brahmins and so on. The Brits suddenly after that saw both the sort of educated upper class, the Brahmin class of the Indians as suddenly very terrifying and as you said they had to separate from them. And also the Muslims in general were in very bad repute. As Aditi described it, they responded, it reminds me of how the Mormons responded to the Mormon war in the late 1850s. They responded by realizing, well, maybe we'll become the best, I mean a group of at least a certain part of the Muslims, not definitely not all because most of them went with the Congress nationalist up until the end. But enough of them decided, well, our best hope as a minority and as a people who just got slaughtered by the Brits is not to rise up again, but to get in good with the Brits and find sort of a mutually beneficial relationship. But they need people to keep peace here and we need them to not kill us and maybe we can get more power from them. Yeah, there's a nice parallel with the Sikhs there too because the Sikhs were wiped out before the Mutian, the 1840s for the most part. And they were wiped out by British forces. Their response that was in a strange way to become the most loyal and courageous soldiers in the Raj. And as Aditi was telling us when we talked about this, part of that was that the Sikhs saw this as their revenge because they took part in suppressing the so-called mutiny as a way of getting back at those high class, high caste Hindu armies that had been a big part of helping to destroy Sikhs and independence. So this is what you can do when you're an empire. You can play A versus B versus Steve versus A. The more players you have, the more ways you have of controlling your territory. It's a grim way of doing things, but unfortunately it works. And my understanding is the first sort of embers of this idea of trying to separate electorates from Muslims goes back to, I think it was first proposed by the Agha Khan, if I'm saying this right, back in 1883. It wasn't very popular yet. And that eventually led to setting up this Muslim link party in 1906 by the Agha Khan. The Agha Khan, and it was set up with backing from Bengal landlords actually in 1906. It was also in response as you said to Lord Kursan's plan. But an interesting kind of side note here, and I'm sure some listeners will know more about this than I do. But the Agha Khan who started the Muslim League comes from a small, a minority Muslim second, I mean most Indian Muslims with most Muslims are Sunni. The Agha Khan who founded the Muslim League party was Shia, but from a group of shithir, I think they're known as the Gujarati Hodja, Shia. And so from Gujarat originally at least, which I think I was also where Gandhi was from and definitely where Modi is from. Big, wealthy manufacturing center, it's always kind of been a powerful province. And Jhinna who winds up taking over later and becomes the founding father of Pakistan is also Gujarati Hodja. And there as I understand it tended to be a much more, their small minority and like some small minorities, they're a pretty relatively comparatively wealthy merchant class, better educated. And these days of course they've been at the Shia in Pakistan have been quite persecuted, but it's interesting that it was founded by basically a secular Shia. Yeah. Yeah, well that's always been a sore point about with Pakistani nationalists. Muhammad Ali Jinnah was not someone who wore his Pakistani nationality on his sleeve. He preferred Western clothing, he kept dogs, he drank scotch. He was not notably religious and he was a Shia by loyalty, even if he didn't particularly believe one way or the other. And interestingly there's a big urban legend in Pakistan that he became a Sunni on his deathbed. Yes. Yes. And you get a lot of these deathbed conversion stories like Darwin, there's some lady hope who went around. That's lady hope said, oh Darwin changed his mind on his deathbed and he became just monkeys. Yeah, I'm a good Protestant now. And his Darwin's kid said, wait a minute, I was there at his deathbed. First of all, she wasn't there and second he didn't say any of that. But this was still getting publicized by the oral Roberts University crowd all over the place. People want to believe those deathbed and it's not just the religious people. I mean, I'll never forget this famous scene in Bob Woodward's book on Bill KC CIA in the 80s. And KC of course got a brain cancer and died and died. And Woodward had claimed because the book does reveal it's not a very flattering book to KC despite Woodward's own kind of weird creepy intelligence ties. But anyway, he claims that KC on his deathbed had repented and recanted like all of his many crimes in Iran, Contra and everything else. And it was like, I was wrong. I was wrong. You know, as like Bill KC, are you out of your fucking mind? Yeah. When you read that, it was such obvious pulp, safe way supermarket, you know, dime store paperback bullshit. And it made you think, wait a minute, that this is the guy that we have to trust, you know, with the whole Watergate story. And I guess so obviously willing to come up with canned literary devices to make a good narrative. Or, you know, not even a good narrative like what other times that he did that shit. So it's kind of interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah, Woodward has that big soft spot for the American elite. Oh, yeah. He thinks they're human and that leads into a lot of stupid conclusions. So yeah, then we were already seeing the development of parallel independence drives. Behind Gandhi, who comes to power in the interwar years as a really magnetic charismatic figure. And the Muslim League at the same time fighting for its share of power. And but there's a real effort to avoid partition. There's a real sense among a lot of more thoughtful Indian intellectuals of both religions or neither religion. And then there's other religions too. Like when you mentioned, you know, small religions who are full of overachievers, the Parse, India, where are a classic example of that. And various other small religions, there, you know, Indian Christians as well. A lot of small religions. Are the parsees, they're sort of related to Zorastrians? Is that right? Yeah, they are. They were originally Iranian refugees from the Muslim conquest. Oh, right, right. Yes, yes. Yeah. Yeah. And so there's the sense that we don't have to split up. Let's not split up. It's something that the British administration is intramently pushing. Yes. And there are a lot of people who feel that their careers could be bigger in a religiously split subcognitive than in one that's, you know, just a large secular state. Right. Right. But initially in the 1930s, the Muslim League attempting to make a Muslim political party so that Muslims will vote their religion does not do very well. It's surprising. I mean, the Congress party, which is the secular, if Hindu dominated, Independence party, wins in elections in the late 1930s, the Muslim League gets less than 5% of Muslim votes and does not hold power in any of the provinces. This makes it possible for people who run the Muslim League to start thinking, well, you know, maybe we can make a deal with the British. Yeah, I just wanted to say something quickly about Gina. Gina was initially with the Congress. He was not with the Muslim League. He was not for communalism or sectarianism or, and eventually, then he kind of positioned himself as a moderate, trying to bridge gaps between the Muslim League and the Congress. So there's one, there's a book, I mean, I tried to find the Indian angle on the British role in this. And I found a pretty interesting book, I'll give you the name of the title. The book is called The Shadow of the Great Game, the untold story of India's partition, until at least in the angle world. The author is a former diplomat, Nurendra Singh Sarila. I'll try to make sure I post a link to this. It came out in 2005. If you can find a review or two from the British press, they're very, they're very, very, but not happy with this book. I found a couple of reviews and sort of like, they can't dismiss it because all this former diplomat did. I mean, he actually witnessed, he was an older guy. So he actually, and he came from a powerful family. So he was witnessing this from the time of his youth. And then when he finally retired from the Indian civil service, he went to Britain in America and just poured through declassified documents to sort of show from the inside what he saw and from the outside. And what is, I think, accurate is that Jhinna was, as you said, I mean, he was not just very westernized, but he wanted, he showed it as much as possible how westernized and Britishized he was. And in the 30s, he spent, he actually started essentially kind of dropped out of Indian politics in the early 30s. He wasn't going anywhere with the Congress party and the Muslim League. He didn't have great prospects with it or didn't believe in it much by the end of the 20s and early 30s. He was frustrated. He went to Britain and he spent most of the 30s as a very wealthy and expensive and successful barrister. And got mixed up in politics on two. Shortly before he left and came back to India towards the end of the 30s and when he did start to become very big, very quickly, he had run for a seat in parliament with the territories and made some good Tory connections at that time that became important later with people who were appointed as vice-roise and so on. So he had common cause with the party in power. I mean, Nairu was more connected with labor people, right? And Nairu also came from a very elite family. But Jenna's contacts that he made in the 30s in London, living in London, moving in sort of Tory circles and political circles became very mutually useful as a better way of putting it because the Brits, they didn't want communal violence while they were at the time that they were sure they were believed in their minds that they were not letting India go for the world and they had no plans to let it go. At that point, they didn't necessarily want them all killing each other. It was later when they realized, well, we're not going to be able to hold on to India, but for a whole lot of strategic and other reasons, a British-backed Pakistan could be really useful and that's when that relationship with Jenna really blossomed in lightning speed. It's another thing that's linked to the disaster of World War II because once again, there's that split among Indians. The colonizing power that controls us is involved in a fight for its life again. What do we do? And they're going to lie to us again, right? So the Congress Party, which is very much secular, don't call us a new party. We are not a Hindu party, we are a secular independent India party. And remember, the Raj goes from Burma to Afghanistan. The Raj is all those nations combined and it's seen as a single thing. So the Congress Party says, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're not going to talk us into fighting your battles again and then being cheated at the end of the war. Jenna and the Muslim League by contrast, see an opportunity. These people still have power, you know. We can make a deal with them and we'll do better with them than we will with Congress. So Jenna and the Muslim League cooperate with the British government. They support India's participation in the war and the way the war came out, that was a good decision for them. They actually had done something for the British that was due for repayment. And after the war, the British government, even though it was probably doomed in India, still had power like they could decide on what terms independence came about. And Jenna comes to power within the Muslim community. He's there liaison with the British, the British like and understand him. He understands and likes them. So he starts to promulgate the idea of Pakistan, land of the pure as a Muslim homeland. And at this point, I don't know most of our listeners are too young to imagine how Pakistan was on the map. You know, it's like very, very weird place like a bit of northwestern India and eastern Bengal Bangladesh now. Modern day Bangladesh. Yeah. Up until 1971, that was one country. Pakistan. We had to fly across India to get from one part of the country to get to the other. Never a very practical arrangement, but it was part of the consequence of trying to divide the subcontinent into Pakistan as Muslim majority areas and India as Hindu majority areas. And this creates the stage for the partition, the big one. Before we get up to back to 1946, I wanted to just reiterate a couple things about Gina, the founder of Pakistan and sort of the politics that were going on at the time. One thing that I think is definitely true is that the difference in styles between Gandhi and the Congress party versus Jenna. But Nurendra Singh Sarilla says, and I think this seems to be accurate, is that back when Jenna was still with the Congress party back in the 19, the first two decades of the 1900s, and Gandhi came back to India in 1915, Gandhi, very famously from the movie, you know, brought with him this mass action politics. And the thing about the mass action politics was that, I mean, it works on, if you can do it, if you can pull it off to me, it's like one of the great mysteries and achievements in all politics, how you can get mass action politics like that going. It's not just that everybody kind of focuses on the nonviolence part. Oh, it's so nice, the nonviolence. I think what's far more important is that when you get people who have so much to deal with in life already, you know, getting food, dealing with their kids, dealing with their parents, whatever, and you get them politically involved, there's so much you can do. I mean, the nonviolence part was just, it was just the tactic. But it's what you're doing is you're activating masses of people who, it's terrifying. To those in power, if they're not relying on that mass activity, mass democracy, whatever, it's terrifying to them what the possibilities are. And you're also basically instilling people, masses of people with a sense of, it can be life changing for a lot of people. Like, well, I have some power. I mean, you hear this a lot from people, for example, who, you know, to take a much, much smaller, not successful example, but people who went through the Occupy movement. It was just, it really changed a lot of people. It awakened them politically. It was sort of like, wow, I can do something and have some power. You know, whether it's an illusion or not, you believe it and you feel it in a way you never would if you just read a book. Jena did not like mass democracy. He did not like, he didn't like Gandhi style. It wasn't his style. It wasn't his nature. And, you know, I think this was, this was kind of important because if you're doing mass style non-sectarian, cross-sectarian politics, like the Congress party did, I mean, how can you, how can you really counter that? If you're, if you're the kind of person who doesn't really like mixing with the masses much, I mean, you know, you do more. Backroom deals. So when, when Jena was still in London shortly before leaving, this is 1938. It's a quote, a note here. He's having various meetings with conservative party people before he goes back. And you know, they're starting to get worried in Britain. I mean, the British do not have any intention whatsoever to. I mean, they're already worried enough by Congress's power. Because winning everywhere, including the Muslim districts, I mean, but they divided up the Raj into, I think, 11 districts. And they were winning, like they won in Sin, they won in the Northwest territories, that they were winning, the Congress was winning. Or certainly the Muslim League was not winning anything. Yeah, they're surprising, uh, Pashtun militancy. Yes. Uh, at this period in the Northwest. It's kind of a very pro-congress or not for the Muslim League, yes. And so there's a note here from these, you know, these various declassified files and memos and letters and so on that, uh, Nurendra Singh. So really, quote, one. And here's one. So, um, Jena meets with, um, the acting vice-roy of India, John Ulik Nachbull, who's known as Lord Bradborne. And he, uh, reports on August 18th, 1938, uh, to the Secretary of State, Lord Zettman, he quote, Jena ended up with the startling suggestion that quote, we should keep the center as it was now, which is to say, Britain should stay in power with the vice-roy, the dictator at the center. I mean, they've devolved some power to some local, you know, to local districts with a very limited, um, franchise. It's not universal franchise, the Brits don't allow that, but nevertheless the con, and they, and they've also tried to divide up, um, the proportions of who gets into these, uh, parliaments so that Congress says very difficult for Congress to create working majorities, but Congress does anyway. So Jena basically is saying don't give up the center of power. Um, that is a state dictators, Britain of India says, uh, Jena suggested quote, we should keep the center as it was now that we should make friends with the Muslims by protecting them in the Congress provinces and that if we did that, the Muslims would protect us at the center, unquote. So there you have it. I mean, that's 1938. And what happens in 19, late 39, really 1940, as you said, is the Congress sees another war happening. They already had the experience, Britain, you know, same thing, Britain versus Germany, Britain promises the Indians if they go and die for Britain, they'll get freedom. We already saw what happened. So Congress has its own internal pressures and its constituents to answer to. Congress is not as absolutely kind of a feat moderate. It was in the late 1880s. They're a mass action party now. So they, you know, correctly describe it as an imperialist war, not our war. We're not going to be enthusiastic supporters of the British role in it. And they boycott all of the British political institutions and demand, they demand from Britain and explicit basically written guarantee that if the Indians back the war effort this time, that Britain will, this time, hold it promise and free him up and basically sign a treaty with the Congress party. And Britain says no. And so suddenly you have an opportunity. This has withdrawn from all the levers of power. However corrupt and rotten they are. They're out of the game and that's a vacuum. And Gina immediately saw the opportunity and moved into that vacuum. And together with, I mean, it's all documented here in these private correspondences that were later released. But together with the British, they formulate a justification and they have better justification. I mean, it was, there was probably nothing else that Congress could do to maintain their, you know, their popular support. But nevertheless it was a mistake. It was a mistake that created a big opening. They knew it very well. The British, you know, in charge of India and the vice-roy. New this was an opportunity as did Gina. And the way that they formulated explicitly their mission now was, well, we must protect minorities. From the tyranny of the majority, you know how often you hear that now? I mean, it's one of those really, I mean, John again, you know, the partition in Ireland. It's like, well, we must protect the minorities. So now they have this mission that's even higher than promoting democracy is protecting beleaguered minorities from a non-sectarian party. Yeah. And this allows you to divide what you have always insisted was a unified territory. Now it becomes the domain of the oppressive majority and the threatened minority. And you have two territories where there was once one. You know, I was thinking about how Israel fits into this too. And it's kind of interesting because I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's protecting minorities game is so cynical. I mean, let's be honest, it's just, it's an imperial cynical game. So, you know, if you were to be principled, then you would say we must protect the Palestinians for example under, under, you know, Israeli domination. But actually the way it's been framed in our minds and beaten into our heads for decades is actually the Israeli Jews are a minority in this Middle East region. We must protect that minority, their democracy. Right. All those maps showing the vast surrounded by desert. There is. Yeah. Of Muslim terrain and teeny little coastal strip, which happens to have all the nice far land on it. But yeah. I mean, other times they admitted it's, you know, it's America's aircraft carrier, whatever within the Middle East to control. But it's, it's a strategy cynically used over and over or cynically ignored in other areas where minorities genuinely do need protection and won't get it because it's not in the interest of the empire. So, that I think is just kind of important background to what happens in 46, 47. No, I think that's really true. And it's, it's amazing how quickly that strategy pays off for Jinnah and the Muslim League. Yes. It's in the 1940s that this notion that there are two quote nations of India. The two nation theory becomes popular. And that leads to Jinnah becoming the accepted leader of Muslims in India. And that's a huge number of people. And it leads to the need for a homeland for these people. And actually when you mentioned Israel, it's interesting that two countries were founded around 1948, Pakistan and Israel. And they were both founded on similar lines like. And buddies too. Yeah. Yeah. It was quite, quite the vogue at the time. Yeah. Once again, Congress wins most of the non-Muslim seats, but the, the, the Muslim League now gets most of the Muslim votes. In a sense, that's the battle already won because when you've got this two nations idea, and you've got the quiet, but very powerful support of the colonizers, then you're well on your way to achieving what you want. I mean, the, the other question is, to what extent did the British do this as a way of crippling the subcontinent? And I don't know. Yeah. Well, no. Again, it's, it's, it's not, it's, it's not just vindictiveness because that would almost be too emotional for the Brit. I'm not, not saying they're not vindictive as hell, but at a higher level, it's sort of like, you know, there was that Churchill quote about the, the secret, the, I think, sin calls it, their hallowed tradition of opportunism. The, the British, Churchill's quote is something effective. The British, the strength of the British is that we don't stick to principles ever. We just see opportunities and take advantage of them and we conquer and rule that way, and we're always shifting, you know, but of course, talk a big game about fixed principles and every idiot believes they have it. But that's not, they wouldn't have succeeded if they had principles. It's pretty much what Churchill was explicitly saying in one of his books. But what, what happens is, they, after World War II ends, I mean, they do realize that they're going to have to give up India in part because Britain can't hold on to it anymore. But really, in large part, because the Americans aren't going to allow that. The Americans have a different post-war strategy of dealing with communism and Soviet Union. And having Britain keep, you know, the second largest company in the world, a country in the world under dictatorial colonial dominates, they had no choice. They were going to have to give it up. So what they were very explicit about was, well, if we can carve up Pakistan because what they understood was, if India, I mean, again, this is through these memos, the British talking to each other, if India has kept whole, they're not going to be part of the common, they're not going to be a dominion. And they're not going to basically let us have military bases there. And the Russia threat, again, now it's called the Soviet Union threat, is first on their mind. Russia threatens this region, and particularly the Middle East. I mean, Britain's interest also shift, whereas India was very important for the China market, back in the 19th century, for the China market, you know, to extract wealth and so on. But after World War I and really after World War II in a huge way, it was clear that the Middle East was what mattered. And the US didn't really kind of move in on Britain's, I mean, for the first 10 years or so of the Cold War until the Suez crisis, the US had kind of farmed out Middle East policy and making sure that the oil producing countries were not in the Soviet orbit. They mostly farmed that out to the British until the Suez crisis. So what Britain said was Pakistan, a Muslim Pakistan backed by Britain with British help, would actually be a massive strategic asset. It is, you know, right up near the Soviet Union's border, I mean, just across from Afghanistan, it gives us access to, you know, it basically giant air bases and close access to the Middle East and to the southern, the underbelly of the Soviet Union. And it shows to the Muslim world that we care so much about protecting Muslim minorities. They say that in these documents where they're giving this to the US. I didn't know that. I'm going to have to read this book. It's so amazing. Okay. Sarula. Okay. Narendra Singh Sarula. Yes. Yeah. So I mean, bringing it up to the actual events of the partition. I mean, look, let's just, let's just briefly describe it here because we got to wrap it up. But the partition was extremely bloody, extremely violent, you know, well over a million people killed. I think as it was described, maybe by Aditya in a previous episode, you know, that there were these scenes of people from one, from one side, you know, holding ropes over trains to just sweep off people from the other community off the trains going one way or the other way. So that they could be killed after they could be killed. Yeah. Hit the ground and we're stunned. Yeah. Right. And then robbed, raped, killed, standard. Yeah. And some were allowed to continue on their way. Others were just murdered and thrown away. Over 15 million displaced, I think it was one of the largest, if not the largest sort of displacement, you know, immediate displacement of people in the 20th century or certainly one of the largest. But the question is, you know, why did it have to be that way? And I think what's demonstrated pretty clearly is that it's because an orderly, slow transfer was not in the British interest. The British had lots of agency here. And their agency was to secure British military and resource interests. The resources were in the Middle East and Malaya. But largely the resources that mattered. The most of them were the oil resources in the Middle East where they still had colonial relations before they were displaced by the Americans. They wanted, I mean, they knew, you know, again, there are other documents even going back to the 18th, the later part of the 1800s where the British knew that setting up a Pakistani state, there was one of the vice-roy agents, Memo saying if this were to ever become, you know, a policy it would lead to terminal warfare between the two communities which we don't have now. Why would we do this? They knew it would lead to that, but that's good because then one side, the Muslim side which the British had chosen, needs the British even more. Leans on them even more. And the British looked even more like good guys or so they thought. So they explicitly believed to the Muslims in the Arab countries where they wanted to take their oil. I'm not sure how much that really ultimately translated, but they certainly believe that at the time. And they knew they weren't going to get anything from a Congress party led India. So it didn't, it just didn't mean anything to the British, you know, that it was going to be this ugly and it was actually helped them to create a client state and they did. I mean, I know I just don't know. It just perfectly serves the narrative that they are the helpless referees trying to guide the process, but they just don't have the strength anymore. There's nothing we can do. And also like this didn't happen, which it did though, but this didn't happen when we were in charge. See this justifies our 200 years, the 45 trillion dollars of wealth, the tens of millions, you know, who we never talked about who died in the famines because without us look what they do. Yeah. And on that happy note. Yeah, on that fucking horrible note. And again, it's just, when you hear people on this, you know, on this note, I just want to say when you hear or read in our media and they are all doing this, try out this line again that what happened with the partition was a, was a tragedy born of British weakness and incapable of stopping it. I mean, that is, that's like genocide denial stuff. I mean, it's a, it's really twisted, twisted. And hopefully that's going to change sometime soon. But anyways, yeah, I think we can start there. We'll have to do another episode on the horrible details of the partition itself at some future day. But this one we just wanted to describe how the process happened. Yeah. All right. All right. Thanks, everyone. Thanks everybody.",
