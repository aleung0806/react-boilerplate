    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. The day today is August 11th, 2022 and this is episode 342. I'm the ghost Mark Ames. I'm here in Rochester, New York. And I'm in line with the Warner Gary Breacher, aka John Dolan. And is it Tropea? Is that the name of it? Yeah, it's Tropea. I'm the core of the toe of the big toe of Italy. I'm in there somewhere around there. Hot down there, isn't it? Very hot. Yeah, hot and humid, more than 30 degrees. You mean 50% humidity most of the time. Yeah. How long does that last? I don't know, but we're here through September and I'm pretty sure it will last through September. But even that hasn't been the big problem. The big problem is you gotta look at the maps. I keep telling people that, but do I do it myself? No. So that this map and this keeps happening to us in different cities. You think, oh, we're right near the sea. We can just dive in and cool off in a second. Well, no, because this place used to be subject to a lot of piracy, mainly from the Ottoman Empire, but from other places as well, even Catalonia. And that meant that they built their towns on cliffs. So to get down to the sea here, you have to go down quite a cliff. I'm not getting quite a cliff. And you might think there'd be some sort of public transit down or up, but no, no, no, it's a small town and that cliff draws a lot of water in this town, as you might say, because it means a lot of tuk tuk skit hired. And they do have tuk tuk skit here, interestingly. And taxis and little cutesy trains that take you down there and then bring you back, except you can never get one. So we keep going down to the beach and then coming back up the cliffs and I keep getting in a worse and worse mood as we ascend these endless cliffs. I'm going to go down and I've never joined Miss Kess. It ain't worth it. Yep. But are you learning Italian in this? Yeah. Well, I'm in Italian class. Catherine and I are both in Italian class, although she's at a higher level, four hours a day. Wow. It's really a weird experience at this age to be waking up at the same time and trudging reluctantly off to school to be there on time. Getting in the air gets for being late or getting an answer wrong. Well, you know, there's a kind of a spritical or in all language classes. So you don't like getting something wrong. You have these silent rivalries going with everybody else in the class and it's like, god damn it. I knew that. I knew that. I knew it was irregular. So I bet your Italian is going to be really good. I mean, my god, by the end of this and then when you guys go up to trees, you said you're going up to trees after this, right? Three S. Yes. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. But we've already heard the lowdown on that. It's not really an Italian city, which I think it's kind of a charged question for everybody in the region. So I plan to avoid that question when I'm in Trieste. Well, that serves as a nice segue to Crimea and discussing Crimea and irredentism and all the rest of the stuff, I guess, kind of because three S. Yes. Right. I mean, they may or may not have, depending on who you're talking to, basically taking that from the Slovenians, I would think, or the Slovenians with the croats, one of the two. Yeah. But I don't get into that. It's Austro-Hungarians. I couldn't swear to it at this point because, yeah, we've been looking at other stuff this week. But, yeah, the question that, you know, the reason I kept bringing up the white guard is that it does such a good job of dramatizing the question is Kiev, a Russian city or Kiev, or a Ukrainian city. And it doesn't have a simple answer to that. There isn't a simple answer to that. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think that the reason we wanted to do more on Ukraine right now is because of Korea, because somebody, interestingly, up the ante and attacked Saki Air Base in Western Crimea. Or maybe did or maybe didn't. I mean, I think we can all agree the overwhelming odds are it was a Ukrainian attack, but they're being a bit coy about it. The coignus is interesting, but I don't believe it because I, well, first of all, unless they're faking the photographs, you can see the photographs of eight or nine jets in reinforced shelters that were destroyed. So it's not that easy to have a simple gas blast or even the ammunition blast in an unconfined space that destroys things like that. That's how movies do it. So that's why the movies, anybody who's used grenades, and I haven't, but I've talked to people who haven't, they say the difference between movie grenades and real grenades is that movie grenades are all blast and no shrapnel, no real damage. Because when you just make a blast with some sort of incendiary in an open area, it doesn't actually do much harm. It mostly goes straight up. But when you have a grenade that is lined with little bits of shrapnel that are meant to shred anybody in its path, there's not much of a blast, but the shrapnel is deadly. And this looks like something hit those airplane bunkers from above and those walls meant nothing to it. And that doesn't sound like, you know, oops, I smoked a cigarette around the powder magazine. Yeah. I think the more sort of pro-Russia accounts are trying to, you know, when you watch the different accounts, you know, they always try to minimize the other side's ability to pull something off. And you could see also from the Ukrainians are really good at trolling in meme stuff. And they had some admittedly funny responses. I mean, Graham Dark, if I were, you know, a Russian nationalist, it would piss me off to no end. But like something like, you know, esteemed Russian tourist visiting our Kremlin peninsula, you know, you're always welcome. But be careful of, you know, smoke and explosions. We wouldn't want you to get hurt while you're visiting something like that. And so that was, I mean, clearly a way of doing a funky chicken, you know, celebration in the end zone sort of thing in this case. But yeah, they haven't officially admitted it. And there have been a lot of versions. John, I don't know what you think has happened, but one version was, well, there was supposedly some kind of long range, either MLRS or, but they were saying it was a Ukrainian system, not a high-mar system. Yeah, which is bullshit. It was just bullshit. It was just bullshit. Exactly. Yeah. And then it was maybe a drone, maybe even the drone. I don't believe that either. Near the UI. I mean, if you look at, they've been, there's been a long drought in Ukrainian victories and the media machine at this point requires a steady stream of Ukrainian victories manufactured or otherwise. And they've been in short supply. So this was a victory. And they're saying stuff that that's transparently false. This was Ukrainian system, like you said. And when you look that up, it's like, well, there's a Ukrainian system, sort of like the high-mars and it's in development. Yeah. Okay. No, they've supplied the high-mars, which is a long range, multiple launch rocket system. And the photos, which they released because, well, they're a private satellite, so it would release them anyway, but also because they need this victory. They need to show this victory. And those photos make it pretty clear that this was an attack that targeted, like I said, multiple reinforced bunkers at the same time. And a whole bunch of trees and shrubs and everything else in the neighborhood. That suggests an area munition. The bunkers are protected from the sides, but not from the top, because they were designed to stop blasts from runway cratering munitions and other things. And there are many cluster bomb lit, basically warhead packages for the high-mars system. Some of them have a range of 300 kilometers. And there are plenty of Ukrainian sites well within that range. Sites where the Ukrainians could drive up a high-mars system because they are mobile. And just with some simple high school geometry, just aim them at the sake of airbase, I mean, some of these have a range of nine meters. Like you can say, this will hit within nine meters of the operation. If you have continuous satellite feeds of what's going on at sake airbase, which they do, because not only are they private satellites, but they're very expensive and very secret CIA satellites that are or NSA satellites that are photographing this place non-stop. You could easily do that targeting. I mean, the bomblets involved could be the M39A1. I'm just beginning to understand these things, but they're plenty of them. M39, basically. Cluster munitions that are released over the target and will fall directly onto the hangers and also blast any bushes and anything else in the area. The question is, why are they denying that? That just reminds me of, well, there are a lot of reasons. One reason that came to mind is, remember when the Israelis killed that Iranian-nuked scientist a few months ago? Turned out they did it with a very small team and a remote controlled heavy machine gun. But I remember immediately after they did that, they said, apparently, gloatingly, we had 60 agents in the area. That seemed odd. Why would you boast about that? It was because they had nobody in the area. They had one or two people. It was a totally automated deal from satellites. They were blasted guy for more, but basically. They wanted, first of all, to misdirect the Iranians on how they did the attack. Also because you can get something like a secondary explosion in personnel terms when you do something like that. How could there be 60 agents here? The Islamic Republic is not known for its patience with the centers. It's not one of my favorite regimes. You get them in a paranoid mood. They start arresting people, executing people, mistrusting each other. Meanwhile, you've done it without having to infiltrate anybody. So when the Ukrainian sources and their Western friends say, we did this with Ukrainian special forces using drones, no, those photographs do not show a little drone zooming around. It would have to be a bug's bunny gremlin to destroy planes and reinforce shelters in those numbers. They show an MLRS attack as far as I can tell. You don't think it's sabotaged by local part, what they would call partisan or special forces or something like basically just planting bombs. That wouldn't make any sense. I know that's the alternative that people are offering. You would know that better than me, but I would say no. Crimea is not one of those demographically divided areas. One thing they don't tell you is that by every single account I've heard, the referendum in favor of aligning with Russia was overwhelming in favor. That was notably absent from the stories about this strike on Ukraine. I'm sorry on Crimea. I think it would be harder to infiltrate something in the middle of Crimea than it would be say in the places that have been recently conquered by Russian troops. There are probably a lot of pissed off people. No, I don't think there are here. When something like that happens, it doesn't cause the damage of these photoshow. These are reinforced bunkers for each plane. You don't just stroll down the runway, tossing incendiary grenades in each bunker. It just doesn't look like that. Another reason why they might be being coy is because if it was high mars or Britain just announced, this is interesting. Their announcement came at the same time almost. That they're sending long-range MLS systems to Ukraine. Their own version, it's the M270. It can fire 12 guided rockets up to a range of 80 kilometers under one minute, but that's still not as long distance as the high mars. John, I thought our whole thing with the high mars was we were only giving them systems that reach supposedly. The high mars can go that distance, but that we were only giving them munitions that go much less. More like that. That's why it may be why they're being coy about it. It's a good reason to be coy. I'm sure whoever in the Russian military was in charge of handing out a book va to that cowboy who shot down Malaysian air fly. I'm sure they said the same thing, but once you hand these things over to local commanders who are pretty pissed off and will strike back with anything they've got, you don't always have an easy time controlling them. I don't think they had a team of US Special Forces troops guarding each high mars unit and saying, no, no, no, you can't. You can't fire that until we say so. They handed them over. Once you hand them over, this is going to be, it was a juicy target. I'm not saying either that there wasn't US-UK NATO cooperation on this. They may well have been. NATO itself is getting pretty pissed off at the stagnation of this war. They may have decided at some very high levels. We need a photo op with some destruction of Russian assets in it. They may have given the green light. Or some mid-level, mid-high level, Ukrainian commander may have said, fuck those guys, they gave it to us. We're going to use it. Yeah, what are they going to do? They're not going to come here and fight the war. We're the ones fighting it. It is also interesting, when you look back to what seems normal now on so many levels. First of all, the war almost seems normal. It's so goddamn insane that Russia invaded. The economic sanctions, well, that seemed smart at the initial version of it until we start getting into energy. But the weapons systems, initially it was stingers and javelins. The stingers seemed like, well, that's the kind of thing that could come back to bite us. But I don't think we really imagine, I don't think many people imagined in late February that we would be supplying high mars, which is a real serious deadly system that can strike into Russian territory, deep into Russian territory, to Russian proper, not just Russian occupied Ukraine. Now you guys got to promise me you're going to be good. This is a war, like you said. Everything has been sort of a test. If we really wanted Ukraine to win badly, you would have thought we would have given them all this stuff right up front, but we didn't really know what Russia's response was going to be. We weren't ready to go nuclear, blow up the world for it. When you do it, drip, drip, step by step, each little thing seems like a new normal, and you kind of test the boundaries of Russia and what they're going to do in return and they haven't done, frankly, their options are limited and they haven't done anything big and kinetic back at the US or at the Europeans so far, except for fucking with their gas. It's kind of gone up and up and up. Now we're at the point where the high-march systems are there. Your account of this sounds like the most plausible version of what happened, I would say, that it was high-march. Well, we don't have to go with me. We have the esteemed Elliott Higgins China. It's big in Osen, which stands for like, never mind. He's fresh from his successes in the Syrian war. The founder of Belling Cat said, he can't think of a time, and I'm going by the Guardian's story today, which also had the photographs I was talking about, that he can't think of a time Russia has lost this many air assets in one day in recent memory in a series of tweets. He did say one way to interpret those craters is precise strikes from a long-range munitions. He had the illuminating comment also that the craters appeared to measure about 20 to 25 meters wide, which would mean a pretty big munition. Who can say him nay? The next paragraph is but Alexei Arostovich. He's the hothead, yeah. He said, cryptically said, even the Guardian said, cryptically said, the blasts were either caused by Ukrainian-made long-range weapons, which is bullshit, or the work of Ukrainian guerrillas operating in Crimea, which seems unlikely to me, but I don't know why you tell me. No, I think you're right. I think you and Elliott, let me say, I'm with team Elliott here too. No, I think it's just the most plausible explanation. It's not a new untested system. The precision of it, the precision of it, frankly, says to me that US intelligence was involved in the targeting. What it's going to do is, I mean, what's it going to do? It's pissed off the Russians. It's embarrassed them. People are going to get in trouble, potentially, there. It means that it's going to complicate their job more because from what I understand, they haven't used their air power much in this war. It's been one of the surprises. My understanding is the last couple of weeks, two, three weeks, they've been using their air power a lot more. A lot of rockets fired from aircraft and they haven't been getting hit. If they're using them a lot more and you haven't heard about it in getting hit, I mean, even the Ukrainians aren't claiming so. You want to create problems for them. It's always been the smart move to hit aircraft on the ground. That was how Israel won the Six Day War. It's how Egypt almost won the Yumkin War War, frankly, too. It's getting all the Israeli jets on the ground. Yeah, of course you want to do that. I don't think they're going for the win here, but it does come right at the time that, John, you brought it up to me and then I checked and yeah, it was a lead story at BBC and on their podcast that Zelensky came out. It's being marketed as a big policy shift and perhaps it is that Zelensky's come out and said the goal of the war now is to reclaim all of the taken territory, including Crimea. It's no longer to return to just before Russia's invasion in February, but not just to return to February 22nd, but to take back all the territory taken since 2014, which would include Crimea, which Russia considers actual Russian territory. Yeah. That's why the 2014 referendum came up in so many stories today and it was treated and really shocking way. They were dancing around the fact that the referendum was overwhelmingly in favor of aligning with Russia. I don't take a Russian side here or any other side. The whole war depresses the hell out of me, but nobody doubted that. The Crimea really wanted to align with Russia. For one thing, Russia's richer than people got richer after they aligned with Russia. And all the rich tourists were all came from Russia and Russians had bought up a lot. It's been a big party spot for wealthy urban Russians since the late 90s and Ptuch magazine started having big raves there. It's overwhelmingly pro-Russian province and they held referendums on this going back to 1991 for separation from Ukraine, brought autonomy or to align with Russia. It wasn't until Putin returned for his second set of terms 2012-13 that the Kremlin really massively instrumentalized that. In the 90s, they suppressed it in the early 2000s. I think after the orange revolution, they started really to encourage it and foment it. But yeah, but it's also real. I mean, it's, you know, cost of separatism is real. Cost of our Albanians really did want to get away now. They would not have had NATO gotten involved in that war and NATO had its own reasons, but it's not like NATO invented out of thin air. The cost of our Albanians desire to separate from Serbia. So yeah. Anyways, so today, I think, so we wanted to talk today about, well, the war today and what's going on with it. And I mean, we need to have some more updates. Some folks have been sort of asking us to try and get back to the Ukrainian war more often. We don't want to be a Ukrainian war. We said this early on. We don't want to be a Ukrainian war like podcast. I'm sure there are other places for that. But it's fair to, since we are a war podcast, and this is the most talked about war, at least in the global north these days, and the most consequential war because of the economic impact that we should try and update it at least every, you know, more often. And, but we also wanted to, since Crimea was in the news, also by the way, you know, there was a bombing of a, of a Bella Russian air base in the Goma region. It's sort of southeastern Belarus. This was like within the last day. And it might have blown up some Russian airplanes or air assets there as well because they've been using that air base, I think, to bomb Ukraine. And there's, so I, and it's about 30 kilometers from the border. So that may have been the other, another attack also. I mean, they're clearly going for, they're, they're clearly going for other theaters because the theaters where they're fighting one part because are not going so well, I think, is one of the reasons. Well, yeah, that was something else we wanted to talk about today, which is the, the strange life of this war in, in the media, which rarely matches what seems to be happening for any length of time. Like we were talking about how a few weeks ago, the big news was Ukrainian counteroffensive. And we both doubted that because when people are fighting for their own territory, they can often, even if half trained, make a good defensive effort, but it's a lot harder to go on the offense. So this seemed unlikely. Ukraine hadn't really shown much offensive capability at any time in the war. They had done some excellent defending, mechanized attack as a whole different world. So this seemed unlikely and we were talking about how those news stories just seemed to fizzle out. Yeah. There's a question about if there was maybe a first counteroffensive that was actually launched or not. I think there's some good evidence. I mean, there was, there was a time when you were getting a lot of very kind of Rara reports from Ukrainian accounts. This is about, I don't know, about three weeks ago, I would say, three, maybe even four weeks ago, the sort of second half of July about Ukrainians taking this village, that village bombing out an important bridge. It looked, it looked like certainly compared to what's going on in, you know, the previous months of the war. It looked like some movement was happening. And everybody knows that if Ukraine is going to launch a counteroffensive, the place that makes the most sense is to launch it in the South to retake Kerson and basically try and open up the Black Sea coast again down there. And at the very least, bottle up Crimea, I mean, Crimea, you know, talking about retaking Crimea, it seems to me extremely hard to actually get so easily defendable because it's a diamond-shaped peninsula with a tiny little like plank that goes onto the mainland. It would require really the collapse, like a full kind of end of World War I style collapse of the Russian state and military. I would think for that to happen. And also an assumption that Putin wouldn't drop nukes to protect it, which is a big assumption. But I understand why he's saying that. I mean, it's raising the negotiation ante up some, you know. So it's a big sort of concession if later on, Zelensky says, okay, well, for now we won't you know, retake Crimea, but in return, you have to give A, B and C or something. Like, that's how I see it. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. But there have been a lot of reports and certainly more and more on the sort of pro-Russian side. You are, they've talked about it quite openly that the Ukrainians launched a series of counteroffensive in the Kyrgyzstan region. I'm never always sure if I always thought it was Kyrsson, but I think Ukrainian pronounced it Kyrsson and like Michael Kaufman who is Ukrainian pronounced it Kyrsson. I'm not sure why. And it's like KH, I don't know. Yeah, I thought Ukrainians were noted for that more aspirated H like sound. Yeah, I'm not 100% sure maybe some other people can say. And Kyrsson I think is the Russian, would be the Russian way of saying it. They generally don't want to have anything sound like the Russian version of anything these days, which makes sense. And I think they also try to make some moves on Novakahovka, which is like, well, it's very deep in Russian hell territory. It's sort of where the Nipro, the Nipro river kind of widens out like east, very east, north east of Kyrsson. Anyway, it failed. And one account that I heard from, so I don't know, I try to kind of survey a range of accounts. I'm sure you do too. And then you start to parse them out based on how reliable they've been, particularly when events don't go their ways. So I follow a certain amount of validly pro-Russian accounts, a validly pro-Ukrainian accounts, and then sort of mainstream DC think tanks. And I've weeded a lot out over time because some of them are just complete bullshit and completely unreliable. Anyway, on the pro-Russian side, I think the guys who do the, I think it's called Russians with Attitude, it's two Russian guys. Like, from my point of view, they're politics suck, they're very pro-Russian, Russian nationalists. And also very smart, they are usually pretty accurate, you know, and I think I have a sense now when they're being overly defensive and so being full of shit. And one of the guys, and they know they're military well, like they're their, they're Warner Dorks in a way. And one of the guys says that he said on his podcast that he's got a close friend, I think he was in the LNR volunteer force, militia, the Luhans, not on people's Republic one, and that they're in constant contact. And he seems to have a lot of good sources, these, like, they're these two hosts, does him to have good sources. Again, on the Russian side, so when I say good sources, I don't mean that they're necessarily telling the truth, but they're definitely telling the version of truth that that side sees, like, you know, close up. And anyway, this guy, fighting in the Kyrgyzstan region from the volunteer units, went blank for like almost two weeks. And this co-host of the Russian, Russians with attitude podcast said he was, he thought he was maybe killed, like something had happened because that had not happened throughout this entire war. They had been able to stay in contact one way or another. And then he came out, then he re-emerged again. And he said what happened was, for 12 days straight, the Ukrainians launched major offensives, and they were, they happened like clockwork, once in the morning and once in the evening, 12 days straight. And each time they basically both sides mauled each other on each morning and late afternoon, but the Russians started getting, you know, used to the rhythm and it was a kind of surprising lack of, you know, changing things up. And this went on every day, every morning and every 12 days straight down in the south in the Kyrgyzstan region. And that's so strange though. 9 a.m. first attack, 5 a.m. second attack, and then back to barracks. I mean, I, you know, every culture is, you know, you can only change them so much, right? There's a logic to it that has to do with how you can organize. I mean, they're doing something different now that you create. The Ukrainians have been very good on defense for the most part, you know, against generally a much better military. And as you said, defense is easier as well. Now they're doing something like an offense, which is always much harder. And there's a question about the quality of the troops because there's sort of two versions of what's happened in the, in sort of the more northeast part of the Dynesk front. I mean, we had those huge battles that severed a Dynesk and the Sichansk that the Russians eventually succeeded in. The more reports I've read, not just at all from the Russian side, but really from sort of the mainstream Western pro-Ukrainian side, has been that a lot of those units, a lot of the best train units in that fight got utterly mulled before they were able to pull out the remnants of them, of the best train units and put in basically territorial defense, them train grunts. And that started causing a lot of the, like these videos and a lot of this sort of morale problem because these guys are not well trained. They started getting mulled, but they're frankly just not as valuable to the Ukrainians. And the well-trained, long well-trained troops that they were able to save were shifted south for this counter offensive, which is absolutely, it is absolutely necessary, politically, strategically and otherwise, Ukrainians have to, at some point, especially as we're heading into the winter and energy shit is going to hit the fan in Europe in ways that we still have our time grasping. They have to show that they can take some territory with all these weapons. I remember, I think we've mentioned it on the last show that I saw somewhere on interview with a British general who had the strange and very distinct line. And I think this is a word for word, quote, it would be who have you crained to start retaking territory now? It was such a, a fell scary thing to say. Yeah. British men are interesting. Yes, menacing understatement. If I were you, I would get going. Yeah, they're in that place now and it's dangerous as hell because if they launch counteroffensive with what good forces they still have, and it's easier to defend, now Russia's had some time to set up defenses. If they fail, it's worse than if they don't do a counteroffensive. I mean, at least you can shame the Europeans. You're complaining about your cold, but we're dying here. If you still have forces to fight with, you can still shame the West for the fact that you're basically defending them from the Russian hordes or whatever you want to stay. But if you ain't got nothing left, that's really dangerous and you could start destabilizing the whole regime. And by the way, you don't have to wait for the winter for Europe to start feeling the energy crunch. There was news out of Spain today that by a new Spanish law, all air conditioning systems have to be turned up to at least 27 degrees and 27 degrees pretty hot. Yes. I don't know what it would be in Fahrenheit. I think it's about 80. Yeah. I'm saying, and this is with humidity that you have in Europe at this time of year. So it's like the heat factor is more like closer to 90 and especially indoors. I mean, that's, yeah, that's, that's pretty horrible. So when you're getting back to their, their story with the friend said is sort of getting close to day 12, a whole bunch of regular Russian troops. Because what the Russians do is, from what I can tell is they use a lot of LNR, DNR, volunteer battalions to do a lot of the sort of the harder fighting. They're dying and they're dying and getting wounded in much larger proportional numbers than Russia proper regulars are. I think this is something that isn't being fully grasped by Westerners who keep, keep having this dream that Russia is running out of troops and yet keep being frustrated. Why isn't Putin called up a bunch more troops? Why hasn't he done that yet? Why hasn't he had his big draft? May still happen. I'm sure, I mean, I would think it's going to have to at some point. But I think it's because they're able to use various volunteer militias and people from the occupied territories use or impress them or, for say, you know, or bribe them or whatever. They get to use them to do this kind of fighting. And then when the regular troops came in and relieved the LNR forces, so the LNR forces that this podcasters friends with, they said they were, you know, they suffered a lot of casualties and said that the Ukrainians, well, they after 12 days, they just were completely exhausted. And they'd only taken so many villages, not much, really. But they had been mauled. And when the Russian regulars came in, you know, after a day or so of that, they just called off the counteroffensive. And I did see one of the top Zelensky advisers. I think it was Putin, the Yak said the other day, oh, yeah, we're not really doing a counteroffensive. That was just misdirection. What we're really doing is trying to draw them away from, you know, listed away from the Bakhmut and that sort of front and confuse them or something like that. But it's an odd mirror image of the Russian claim that we didn't actually send vast numbers of troops in circle and occupy a kiv. That was misdirection. It's always misdirection and a clever info war campaign when you failed, yeah. So yeah, that's the South, you know, that failed. But I think they're still going to go after that. I mean, look, Russia holding on to so much of the Black Sea coast. I mean, they don't have all of it. They haven't been able to take Mikolayev and obviously Interdessa. And I frankly don't see how they'll be able to sort of collapse of Zelensky's regime. I could be wrong. No, that seems like one of the fronts where the Ukrainians have actually held up pretty well. Right, which is why you wouldn't want to do a counteroffensive and blow it all, I would think, you know, but they're getting a lot of pressure anyway. So, but yeah, from the Russians point of view, you know, they want to hold on to that for a variety of reasons. One is they protect what they hold in Crimea, but you know, they have far better protection because they're on both banks of the NEPA River now in control of it. And also, they're strangling Ukraine's economy by holding all that land down there. Oh, and there was another factor you mentioned earlier, which was they want to control enough of the river that they can always make sure Crimea is supplied with sufficient drinking water. Right. That's sort of like the minimum, I would say, need. And then, of course, the leverage that they gained by choking off a lot of basically Russia's export economy. And, you know, there's a certain level. Now they're starting to export. Grain, Russian, Ukraine, and agreed with Turkey about sort of controlled exports of grain. You know, the joke was this is in the New York Times, the first 10 shipments. I mean, you know, again, it's war. It's probably again, I know, but you still don't like to be bullshit. The West was saying that all of the food shortage problems starting to hit Africa are because Russia won't let Ukrainian grain out. And the first 10 shipments, none of them are going to Africa. They're going to Europe. And most of it is for animal feed. And I know it's pretty brutal. I know. So, yeah, that's the other front, I think maybe we mentioned here. Would be, you know, where it was very hot up in the Scythianks of the Donetsk. The next goals were going to be Slavionsk and Kromotorsk, the two largest remaining cities in the Donetsk all-blast region. And movement, like in the last one and a half months or so since Slavionsk and the Scythianks were taken. It's literally like, it's not even a village every two weeks. It's almost more like we got this side of the field of this village. I mean, it's so slow. It's unbelievably slow. And you have to assume at least part of that is that the Russian really did probably exhaust the equipment and manpower to some degree in those big battles there. And the Ukrainians are probably acquired a hard earned weariness about that kind of blitzkrieg mechanized attack. I mean, one of the stories you get again and again from NATO and one of the assumptions behind that British officer's recommendation that Ukraine attacked. Now, was that once winter comms mechanized divisions will become more effective, there will be no more mud, there will be nice ice. Well, first of all, you can't predict that anymore unless you're right at the pole. The ice is unreliable now. Even if you can advance quickly over icy terrain, if you've been hit a few times by MLRS or handheld anti-tank weapon fire, you're probably not going to go zooming across country anymore. It didn't work out last time. It doesn't depend on the weather so much. So I don't really imagine Russia's going to do vast blitzkrieg attack across the frozen ground. Yeah. And another potential influence here too would be the high mars and the long range. I would imagine high mars and some of the artillery that the US and the Europeans have been bringing in has. I mean, it's forced to change in logistics. Well, now that you mention it, those programs were all developed back when I was a hardware nerd. I actually remember the gestation of those programs extremely well. I mean, these long range rockets and artillery. And they were meant to cope with the perceived Soviet advantage advantage in armored vehicles like that sea of rusting tanks that you heard about after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Well, they weren't rusting then. They were assumed to be perfectly maintained and able to sweep to Antwerp in a week. And I don't know if that's true, but I don't know if it was ever true. I certainly don't think it was ever planned in any serious way. But the United States defense industry at any rate saw a lot of money in weapons that could blunt those offences. And one of the buzzwords at the time was attack the second ash law. I even remember a cartoon in Armed Forces Journal showing US cavalry with arrows sticking out of them. And I know they weren't using arrows at Little Big Horn, but that was what the cartoon had. Arrow sticking out of them and Custer's dying there. And one of his officers said says to him, don't worry, sir. Major Reno is attacking their second ash law. And that was meant to be a cynical in-joke among army guys. You know, like we're going to be creamed and they're going to be blasting tank gatherings somewhere in Minsk. And that was because the MLRS was reverse engineered from Russian weapons, starting with the venerable Kattusha and all the things of the grad and everything that fall down from it. The US had depended on air power before that. We will blast those tanks with air power, but they sort of realized with air power, you mostly blanked tanks, blast tanks one at a time. They got a lot of tanks, or at least that was the theory. We're going to have to have something that can blast a whole wave of tanks. So MLRS is not going to be nukes, right? Yes. Pretending it's not going to be. Yes. That was also very, very important. So in this sort of weird, philokitic imagination of war, they decided MLRS systems which would burst open over the target and scatter cluster munitions, which were designed to attack the top of armor, like the top of a BMP, the top of a Russian APC, and blasts through it and destroy it, would be the best way to take care of this sea of tanks that was supposed to be coming west. Since then, they've been dealing with the fact that that can't happen anymore because they are now a sea of rusting or even rusted tanks, or they've been sold for scrap. I don't know. Now, part of a Toyota that you saw driving down the road yesterday, and they have to have different purposes bound for them. So yeah, they're probably going to be used in that vein if Russia ever does decide to do another massed mechanized division attack, which also suggests Russia won't do that. But in the meantime, they're apparently using them to hit probably the Russians were doing logistics and storage and stuff like that in a way that had different assumptions before the high mars were brought in. Again, with US intelligence, and I think this has been, the high mars are a good weapon. They're not going to be a game changer, but they will be a game alter to some degree. I would imagine. But US intelligence has been by far, I think, the most effective single weapon that foreign countries have given to the Ukrainian forces. So you can just imagine them saying, say, you didn't hear this from me, but you got to think outside the box here. And just outside the box is this place called Socky, and there's all these very expensive plans, like 50 million each, just sitting there, getting a tan on the bunkers. Okay, before we move on the next thing, just a couple other, I mean, there have been a lot of sort of media-ish stories that have gone along with the war itself. The war, as we said, hasn't moved much at all in the last month and a half. And some of the media stories, the big one currently is there's Russia controls this nuclear plant in Zapparogia, and it's the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. And the Russians took it, they took a lot of heat for it, they control it, they might even be showing Ukrainian positions from that plant. I'm not sure, but there has been showing into the plant. And the Ukrainians are accusing the Russians of shelling themselves inside the nuclear power plant. And the EU seems to be backing them up, accusing Russia of shelling themselves in the nuclear plant, which is, I don't know, that's a little weird. I mean, it's maybe, it's weirder than the olenevka one, I would say, like on the scale of what's plausible, that seems to be extremely highly unplausible. At least it's vaguely plausible that the olenevka POW camp with the Asov guys are held. There was the big explosion there, and the Russians said it was bombed by Ukrainian rocket or rocket attack. And the Ukrainians are saying the Russians did it, the official version, I'm not sure if they still have stuck by this, but I've noticed that the Western media barely reports this, only like the real hardcore Ukrainian part of the Western media is. But the official Ukrainian explanation for that bombing of the olenevka POW camp that killed about 55, almost all Asov, I think, prisoners, is that the Vognor group, this Russian black water group, was stealing supplies from the POW camp and thought they were going to get caught for it. And so they bombed that part of the camp because apparently that's where the records were kept. You know, what would you steal from a POW camp? I have no idea. Like socks, MREs, like that, it's a little weird. Then there's another version that the Russians wanted to do a provocation. I haven't seen really how they, I mean, usually there's a part two if you're doing a false flag. Then part two is where you, where it leads to something. I'm not sure what it's really led to. I mean, this bombing went off. There's, you know, Elliot Higgins to talk about him again has been, I mean, Bellincats been oddly silent about it, or at least they wore the first two days. But Higgins was kind of tweeting out some satellite photos that showed that maybe the Russians were digging mass graves outside the camp in preparation for killing 50 out of 2,500. It doesn't, like nothing makes sense. I'll grant you, the whole invasion doesn't make a whole lot of sense, you know. But my best guess is that the Ukrainians screwed up and may have even been, you know, lured and disgrowing up and bombing it. I don't know. That's just my best guess. Yeah. The betrayal is very, very common in situations like this. And as you said a long time ago, the, as of guys are a tremendous embarrassment for Ukraine. That's been sort of pushed up by a general consensus, but it's still there and it festers. And if the Russians had any sense, and again, as you say, that's not a given here. They haven't acted with much sense in this war. But if they did, then as of prisoners are extremely valuable. Yeah. You want them alive. You may torture them, but you want them alive. You want them alive for the show trial. I mean, that's the whole justification for the war that's going to make Putin a hero for fighting this, you know, for launching this war. And that's what's going to boost the ratings at whenever these trials happen. Yeah. And that seems nonsensical. I'm open to anything, but like the assumption that Russians would blow up, you know, and there were people arguing that like Putin had no idea. But there's no way that it's extremely unlikely. But like some Russian commanders are going to blow up Putin's prized assets for whatever reason. It's just, it just seems highly unlikely to me. But, you know, hopefully we'll find out my best. And I don't, I would doubt some more, you know, on the Russian side we're saying, oh, the Ukrainians wanted to shut them up. That's why they bombed them. That doesn't make a lot of sense either. They wanted to shut them up. They've had them fight to the death. And they wouldn't have let them leave, you know, avistall plant. I mean, all those thousands of soldiers. So the, just, Occam's razor says, Ukrainians screwed up. Maybe we're lured into it by Russians, maybe not. That's my feeling. Yeah, well, it would be the easiest thing in the world to have a double-asian plant a laser designator on the side of the building and say, yeah, yeah, bomb art. And then you get to say see their savages. Yeah. And then the Amnesty report, CBS, I don't feel like getting into this now. I think a lot of other people already have. Amnesty, which early on in the war, I didn't know this. And this was, this is very interesting probably for another episode, but they did call out what I was saying at the beginning of the war. I mean, the primary war crime that, you know, emerged from the Nuremberg trials and that was sort of foundational at the founding of the UN is wars of aggression. And this was a war of aggressions, Russia invading Ukraine. And that is the primary war crime from which all other subwar crimes sort of come out of. And the, but Amnesty and human rights were notorious for refusing to take a stand on wars of aggression, which is probably how they were able to become so big and part of the establishment. But, but we found this out from friend of the show, Michael Pollock, because then I was looking at this, you know, Amnesty put out this report that Ukraine was committed to war crime by stationing artillery, by putting military assets in residential neighborhoods, knowing that they're going to get fired on. And, you know, I was thinking, well, yeah, that is a war crime, but like this is the same old problem with Amnesty. It's like, well, they commit that war crime because the larger war crime was committed on them. And, and I looked it up to see if they said anything about that. And I was like, well, Amnesty actually did denounce the crime of the war of aggression. According to Michael Pollock, this is a big change that Amnesty made just a couple years ago. And in human rights watch, like they had big discussions about it and sort of the human rights legal community, international legal community. Amnesty went for it. Human rights watch refused to judge. And, and you know, I mean, this is obviously a major issue because I think Nick Terst, the journalist Nick Terst just just was part of this big report that came out. The US has conducted 400 military interventions since its founding on foreign countries. 400. Yeah. And that's why I have to make a confession here. I mean, when you said that, I was really surprised and impressed. Like I didn't know that. And the reason I didn't know that is I grew up in that place that had done those 400 interventions. Yep, exactly. And I didn't know it either. I found this out through, you know, anyway, through research and stuff because it's not apparent. I mean, the human rights community doesn't talk about wars of aggression as a crime. It's only on the margins that they really do. Because if they did, you know, the US would have to be demilitarized and occupied by blue helmets for all the war. Yes. We've committed. So anyway, they did do that. And then they did their job, which is the call out sort of the sub. I would call them, you know, I don't know, subsidiary war crimes like that one Ukrainian war crime. And frankly, it's not the worst war crime that the Ukrainians have committed. I mean, shelling, denets, civilian downtown central areas, including with cluster munitions. And they've done it repeatedly. And then they blame Russians for shelling their own cities repeatedly over and over. You know, they're doing it to try to draw forces away. It's just it's just war. It's what you do. It's bad, but it's war. And Amnesty didn't call that up, but they did call this other one out, which is sort of the easiest, lowest-team fruit. And man have they taken a beating, the information war. Like, you remember, they claimed James Limissarrier, the British army intelligence captain. Yeah, who killed himself, who set up the white helmets, then killed himself. And the big claim was Kremlin bots harassed him into throwing himself up a balcony. Like the harassment against, if you're going to call for harassment, like not from the other side guys who you don't really pay attention to, but from your own side within the organization, within the Western journalism world, New York Times, everything. I mean, the shit that came down on Amnesty for daring to call out a very low grade war crime, it was, it's pretty damn shocking. There's no dissension allowed. And then CBS did something on corruption in the Ukraine military and how a bunch of weapons are going missing, probably getting sold in the black market. They've had to retract that, or they had to partially retract it. I mean, you know, John, I think in a way, it's a markup. The loss of power, or at least that 20th century consensus elites feeling that they've lost power. Because if you look at any paper of record site these days, it's half Trump and half you praying. And those are like the sore points on that corporate body. They can't believe Trump happened. They can't get enough of Ukraine because it makes them feel like their whole vanished NATO world still lives. It's like constant psychotherapy. That's really, it's a great way of putting it. All right, I think that's a good place to take a quick break. And then we'll come back and talk a little bit about the Crimean War and maybe see what it can tell us about the current war as well. Okay, we are back. And we wanted to go back again to the Crimean War because of some obvious echoes. But we wanted, they're obvious, but then again, maybe not so obvious. We did an episode, episode 67, one of our earlier episodes on the Crimean War. If you want to go back to episode 67, get into a much more in depth into what went on, the lead up to the war, the war itself. There's a lot of crazy stuff, a lot of echoes. But John, why don't you do it just like again for anybody who doesn't know. I'm sure everyone's heard of the Crimean War, but just a very quick recap, like a one minute recap, and then you want to also talk about some battles that led up to it and their sort of relevance today, like the Battle of Neverino and stuff. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think if there's one thing that I would have changed, if we were to do the Crimean War again, it's, we weren't cynical enough about the background of the Crimean War. I mean, basically the Crimean War is thought to prop up the Ottoman Empire. The British and French empires felt that the Ottoman Empire was a useful way of buffering Russia, which they had constructed as this demonic aggrandizing power. That was mostly nonsense. So has been remarkably consistent. It tends to grow and it tends to feel that whatever it has absolutely belongs to it and don't you dare try to take it away. But it's not massively aggressive in a way that the British or the American empires were. They made it such because they had a defense industry too. They had massive need for someplace to put the second sons who became officers. And as I've mentioned before, even when I was living in the South Island of New Zealand, one of the most remote places in the world, the last major landmass to be inhabited by human beings, they're even there. The 19th century British Empire set up extraordinary coastal defenses. And when I asked people what they were for, it turned out they were for the Russian Empire, the actual Tsarist Russian Empire. Because somehow they thought the Russian Navy was going to sail down to the South Island of New Zealand and attack Dunedin. I doubt there was anybody in the Russian naval academy who knew where Dunedin was, let alone could provide the money for a ship to get all the way down there. So anyway, there was... I think it's fair to say about Russia and expansionism and is that if you live on Russia's borders, it's a problem. Yes. Be very careful. If you're not on their borders when you get away, then their ability to mess with you drops over like a cliff. Whereas it's the... Whereas with the Anglo-Aid empires and the French Empire to a certain degree and back in its day, the Spanish Empire, there was nowhere safe from the Anglo-Aid empires. So that's a big difference, I think. Yeah. But the British in particular were sensitive about Russia and India. They somehow... Pretended to forget that the Himalayan mountains existed and thought that Russia might jump into India any day now. So Lord John Russell, famous for saying that the Irish deserve to die because they were bad people, also said in the mid-19th century, if we do not stop Russia on the Danube, we shall have to stop her on the Indus. That is, you know, the gateway to India. So there's a lot. There's a lot. I'm sorry to cut you up, but that reminds me of Adam Schiff and some others in Congress saying, you know, basically we arm... But this is before this war broke out, but we arm Ukraine so that they fight Russia over there so that we don't have to fight them here. As if Ukraine... As if like Russia, if it weren't for Ukraine, it would already be pouring down the Yukon, you know, through Alaska, through the Yukon towards like Washington state. I don't know. It's the most wacky... For Ross. Yeah, for Ross, yeah, you retake it now. We should recommend Yashan Yebgenia's sub-stack. They did a great episode about for Ross. But anyway, so there's this mostly manufactured myth about Russia, but the core of truth to it is that the Ottoman Empire by the mid-19th century is very, very weak. It can't hold on to its mostly Christian principalities anymore. For various quite good reasons, those places were not immensely fond of being governed by the Ottomans. And Russia was expanding toward the south and west at the expense of the Ottoman Empire. Britain and France didn't like this, Britain for what were pretty typically imperial, sane, although cold-blooded reason. France under Napoleon III for much more American-like silly domestic reasons. Napoleon III was making a big play for Catholic opinion in France, which was basically the right-wing opinion, which was basically in favor of the Christian minorities in what was then called the Holy Land. He had actually interfered with Mazzini's struggle to free Italy, and that made him really popular. So, you know, the Victorian focus groups in France were like, woohoo! Go for it! And so he was going to become the defender of the Catholics in Palestine. Russia was going to become the defender of the Orthodox in Palestine. The Ottomans, meanwhile, were very feeble. And actually, and this is something I didn't, I don't think I understood fully at the time of episode 67, they needed constant British and French loans just to exist, just to keep going. And there were British and French advisors in every Ottoman office calling the shots for most of them. The British ambassador was a guy named Stratford Canning, and he was calling the shots on a lot of things, with involved with Turkish policy, basically telling the Sultan's advisors what to do. So when Russia made a play to become the protector of the Orthodox citizens in the Holy Land, the British were opposed to that because it meant Russia might eventually push into the Mediterranean, and they needed the Mediterranean because it's Suez. They needed Suez because of India. A lot of this comes back to India, which they were siphoning the blood from at a terrible rate. Actually, as an Indian economist, she calculated the amount that the British took out of India in their time. And I don't want to take your guess because I can't remember the exact amount, but it's staggering. Yeah, the number is 45 trillion. It's quite a well-known economist from India, Utsa Patniak, you're right. Yeah, calculated that Britain looted 45 trillion dollars of wealth from India. And that's a lot of wealth. And it also kept a lot of British people employed managing the transfer, let us call it, of that wealth. And that meant Suez and that meant keeping the Turkish power in existence up until 1914 when all that changed. They joined with Germany and then it was time for Lawrence to get parachuted into Arabia and make a big movie. In 1853 and 1856, the British and French, and eventually the Sardinians, the Northern Italians joined in alliance against Russia because they thought Russia was going to push the Ottoman Empire out of existence. And they couldn't have that. So a lot of the war ended up being fought in Crimea, specifically at Sebastopol, Sebastopol endured a year-long siege. And eventually the Russian Empire lost this cause, massive harm to the Russian Empire, caused a real crisis of conscience in the Russian elite. And you do get those. It was something like the late Soviet period where the elite turned against its own country and decided, ah, we're no good, we need something else. We need to be pro-Western, we need to be in a westernized. Yeah. They all start thinking we need something else. And Nikolai dies shortly after. But I mean, it should be, Nikolai I think the first, I should say, the reactionary one. But it should say too though that it's not as simple as, it's a war where everyone pretty much lost. I mean, did anybody really come out of that? Okay, I don't know, the Ottomans maybe slightly, but like\u2026 No, I don't think the Ottomans did very well. Yeah, they did. I mean, you know, in the battles, I mean, the Russians had to abandon their posts, right? They had to abandon the forms eventually. But I don't think the British or the French necessarily look back at that as a great war, Victor, you're on my wrong. I could be, I don't know, that was my sense. For what I've been seeing when I look back into it now, the war was pretty popular and the whole effort to prop up the Ottoman Empire was pretty popular in the elite, but it was massively unpopular with the public, both in France and Britain. And it caused a great gulf between them. God that's so familiar. That's why you need the Florence Nightingale, the White Helmets of their day to kind of whip up that middle class support. That's amazing. The Florence Nightingale was prompted into action by the fact that the thing was a mess. I mean, soldiers were not being cared for. In fact, it was a fairly new idea that soldiers should be cared for. It was like, you know, they're more like in an 18th century army, they were more like damaged ants, you know, put them on the heap. And yeah, did anybody really win? A good chunk of that 45 trillion came after the Crimean War. But again, the threat that they were countering was imaginary. The exact same. Navy could have done anything to up and British control over India is just absurd. Right. So yeah, it was a massive delusion. It may have helped Napoleon III for a few years, but not very long because he was going to come up against the Prussians and that would slap you away pretty fast. So no, I guess you're right. Nobody really won very much. But the extraordinary thing looking back at this is I thought just now we could devote a few minutes to comparing two naval battles. The first of these two battles is the Battle of Navarino fought in 1827 during the Greek War of Independence between a British commanded multinational fleet and an Ottoman fleet off the Peloponnes, which is that hand-shaped peninsula in southern Greece, sort of like a handprint in the Mediterranean with the fingertips pointing south. The second one is the Battle of Sinan, which was a naval battle between the Russian and Ottoman fleets a few decades later. And what's extraordinary is both of these involved massive Turkish Ottoman defeats, but they were treated completely differently in the media. The Battle of Navarino is the first one. It was 1827. Greece is fighting for its independence or at least some autonomy. And it's a bloody war. The Ottomans fought counterinsurgency, old style, that is, by killing everybody. For example, in 1824 they respond to an insurgency in the island of Kios by killing between 30 and 50,000 people and slaving the entire rest of the population of the island. This engenders a lot of sympathy in Europe at the time, partly because the Greeks are Christian and the idea of Christendom was still floating around. But more because everyone in the elite in every European country had some experience of Greek at school and had the idea of Greece as a noble place. Greeks as noble people. I've quoted before that Byron dog girl poem, which I personally think is great. When a man has no freedom to fight for at home, let him go fight for that of his neighbors. Let him think of the glory of Greece and of Rome and be knocked on the head for his neighbors, which actually happened to Byron. He died in Greece of malaria, but tried to organize a Greek resistance. And he had the same romantic ideas as the rest of them. So basically it's a long complicated story, but a British commanded fleet runs into an Ottoman fleet, which was also connected to an Egyptian army which had been committing some pretty horrific atrocities among the Greek population. They wipe out this fleet. The man who was in charge didn't quite have permission to do that. He did it because he was one of these pro-Greek romantic guys. He had an Edward Codrington. He'd been a hero at Trafalgar and he was a hero in the popular press for wiping out this Ottoman fleet in 1827. And I mean wiped out out of about 80 ships, only seven ships survived at all from the Ottoman side. It was a completely one-sided sloth. On the British French Russian side, because Britain, France, and Russia are all on the same side in this battle. On the British French Russian side, there were 180 killed. On the Ottoman side, officially there were 6,000 killed. And I suspect it was much higher because in those colonial battles, the colonial powers are so dominant that they have no need to inflate the casualty figures. They tend to deflate them. In fact, the Ottomans would have deflated them for the domestic audience. So if you lose that many ships, I think you suffer a lot more than 6,000 dead. And this made Codrington a big hero with the people of Britain, but a hated man by the British elite. That's one of the constants between now and then. The elite has a way of seeing things that it's very different from the people. The people thought, yay, helping those glorious Greeks, which wasn't quite true either. But the elites had damn that man. They got in the way. I mean, we're supposed to be propping up the Ottomans. There's supposed to be our stuages. They were kind of a self-yetanemese government of the time. You could get your advisors into their offices and tell them what to do. And they had no real strength up their own. So that became a great victory. And then in the 1850s, the Russians have been forced out of that grand European power alliance. And they're involved in their own wars in the Balkans and around the Crimean and around the shores of the Black Sea with the Ottoman Empire. Those don't interest the European powers as much because suppose you're fighting for the freedom of the Serbs or the Valkians or the Romanians or some other Balkan people. Orthodox, right? Yeah. And you didn't study their epics. They had epics, but you didn't study them in school in Paris or London. So who cares? Well, there was a lot of anti-Orthag... I remember this from Orlando Fijas' book. You were right to pronounce it Fijas, by the way. It seems so strange. Fijas sounds like something that would grow in your toes or something that is fused. But anyway, he did a good job, I think, of really bringing back the real, I don't know, phobia about Orthodox Christianity in the West at that time. And that's where a lot of sort of rocifobia came from at that time. But as a general rule, just the loathing for the Orthodox, except for the Greeks, but the Greeks that the elites saw, like we were saying, are really the Greeks of ancient Greece, not necessarily the Orthodox... They kind of just didn't see or Greeks as Orthodox Greece. More like Byzantium maybe, and particularly ancient Greece and cradle of... Although they had an anti-B Byzantium prejudice too. That's true. That's true. So we grew up with Rome meaning Rome. I think it's only in the last, say, few decades that Byzantium has gotten any of the credit to search. But anyway, so this second battle is 1853 on the eve of the Crimean War. And it leads in part to that Crimean War. And the interesting thing is it's exactly the same kind of battle. An Ottoman fleet, poorly officer, poorly served, very bad artillery, is basically wiped out by a European fleet. In this case, a Russian fleet. The Russians have 37 killed. The Ottomans have more than 3,000 killed, probably a lot more. But this battle is treated very, very differently. It's coming at a time when, because of their own domestic needs, the Poles and the Thirds need to become the champion of Catholic France. And there was a Catholic France at the time, oddly enough. And the British need to manufacture some threat, some non-existent threat to their Indian empire. Because of that, this Russian attack on the Ottoman South Vietnamese army, so to speak, is treated as a great atrocity. And even though it was exactly the same kind of battle as Navarino, a quarter century before, it becomes in the British and French press, the massacre of Sino. And it's like, look, you killed all these Turkish soldiers. Well, not as many as you guys did in exactly the same kind of battle. But that was a different time. And the press is totally cooperative with this. That's another weird echo of this. There's very little dissent. And the warped fever is intense in both Britain and France. Probably more intense in Britain. France, generally, at this point, goes along with what Britain wants to do most of the time. And the talk that comes out of London and Paris is all Turkey must be defended from aggression. It may be regarded as an intentional insult to the maritime powers, meaning Britain and France. These ships have been destroyed in a Turkish territory which England is bound to protect. And that leads directly to the Crimean War within a few months. And it's really extraordinary going back over this. First of all, realizing, which I didn't realize at the time when we did episode 67, how much of this involves the fact that the Ottomans were bankrupt. And they were totally living on nonstop supply of loans from London and Paris. And they were infiltrated with mostly British, occasionally French advisors in every office. Even the commander of the Ottoman fleet at one point was a British veteran naval officer. And some of Russia in the 90s. I think I made that point the last time, but it really does. We controlled Russia in the 90s and they were just in such deep debt to us. And we ran their policy, basically, their economic policy, that's for sure. And so the cynicism about both the Turks, the Ottomans and their subject peoples is what really jumps out at you when you go back and look at the Crimean War. It wasn't that anybody in London or Paris was actually pro-Autom. They had a sort of bland contempt for the Ottoman Empire as a rule. But they needed it. It was like a fighter that you'd earlier sort of casually hit and who would then fall into the floor. Now you have to hold him up. Not because you care about him or his career, but because you need him for other purposes. Well, the fear of Russian expansionism was, the fear was very real. Yeah. And that I remember from that episode as well. I mean, the hysteria and the sort of moral hysteria about not just Russian expansionism, but Russia, Orthodox Russia, having some kind of mystical abilities to infiltrate Western societies like France and England and subvert from within. It was such a huge panic at that time, which you know, talk about echoes. It was, and there were all these conspiracy plots. And a lot of this was being fed by emigres, like Polish emigres in France and England. And there was the infamous Peter, Peter's, the greats last will and testament where he had supposedly bequeathed to every czar since and every leader since that Russia must take over and destroy Western Europe from within and then move in and take it. It was a forgery. It was forged by the French secret police sort of like the elders. Protocles the elders. Yeah. Yeah. But as you had pointed out in episode 67, I'd forgotten this. Like I've seen that thing quoted still to this day and is a straight up forgery. But as you had pointed out, the book that we read when we were, you know, Reagan warners in the 80s, the Third World War by Sir John Hackett quotes that as true, you know, and as sort of like the deeper, wow, if you know this, then you really know what Russia's doing. It's kind of weird talking about this now because Russia really did invade Ukraine, you know. But so like we kind of have to keep our heads on straight here. Yeah. And it doesn't therefore mean that every paranoid theory about them is real. You know, it's, yeah, but it is harder to talk about it in a way, isn't it? Yeah. I don't think there's any good lesson from this. The lessons are all bad. In fact, you really wonder, and this is the part that gets me, how much anybody in the Admiralty really believed that the Tsarist Navy was a threat to any place, let alone to Southern New Zealand. I think it was all done pretty cynically. I'll bet you there was, I don't know, comparing today to then I think it's a mixture of cynicism but also like, if you don't go along with this, then you're suspect. I mean, it's sort of like in a church or in a faith, I mean, if you don't at least outwardly display your piety and your adherence to doctrine, then you kind of become suspect, which means you kind of have to constantly reinforce it, at least in public and when most people accept those you seriously trust. Well, that's true, and in those churches, it's particularly I believe because it's absurd. You have to make a point of believing the most ridiculous part of doctrine. I believe Dunneed and Will Fall. If we do not present it, I can't find it on a map, but by God, it's going to fall. But I think another sort of analogy here is just, well, at least in this case, the French and the British put their own soldiers in and died. Not too many British died, but a lot of French soldiers died if I recall. Obviously, a whole lot of Russians were killed in that war. But the idea that they actually cared about the Ottomans, I mean, it's sort of, you know, there is a parallel to today. The Ukrainians are in the war. A lot of the later battles of the war. Yeah, this isn't directly related to what we wanted to say today, but a lot of the later battles in the war were fought by the Russians in Northeastern Turkey and came into Armenian territory and the Ottoman state and post-Odoman state, very cruelly and unfairly blamed the Armenians for that. Though, in fact, the Armenians had had the sense to stay the hell out of it and not take one side or the other, but they still got blamed. So Russia was at least equally cynical here and at least equally indifferent to what happened. And that's still going on today, too, with Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Kutabakh. All around grim stuff. But yeah, I think we can wrap this up now. Again, if you want to know more about the Crimean War, a deeper dive, that was episode 67 of Radio Warner. Five years ago, John, you know, we're, so this is now, today is August 11th. By the end of this month, we'll have survived seven years of this show. Is that crazy? I know. We haven't fixed the world, but on the other hand, it's offended. Yeah. That's saying something. Yeah, and on that happy note. Yep. Yeah, I think we can end it. All right, thanks again, John. Stay cool as much as you can out there. I'll try. Yeah. All right, thanks everyone. Thanks, Brendan. Bye-bye.",
