    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. The day today is Friday the 13th of January, 2023. And this is episode 362. I'm the Ghost Mark Ames. I am in Rochester, New York. And I'm online with the Warner Gary Brecher about to say a farewell bid adieu to Triesta. John, how you doing? Well, yeah, our last night in Triesta, I'm a little sad about that. Yeah. It was your last night, actually. Yeah, we're leaving it Friday the 13th. We're walking to the train station at 5am tomorrow in our inimitable, bull style. So yeah, it's like my last nine hours in Triesta. Kind of sad. And as I've said many times, I like Triesta more than any city. I've inhabited in a long time. But I want to introduce our guest here. Yes. I thought I'd try it this time, even though Mark generally does such a great job because our guests and I go back a long way. We were comrades together in the trenches of the Reading and Composition program in the Red Direct Department at Berkeley. And we've known each other for a very long time. And I'm talking, of course, about the superb critic, superb pro-styleist film historian, Eileen Jones, now film critic for Jackabin. And Eileen has been incredibly productive since, well, for a long, long time. But she's been knocking out great reviews sometimes to a week to the shame of the rest of us. So if you haven't seen those reviews in Jackabin, read them now. We're going to be talking about some of them because this is actually part of our Civil War series. Eileen, as she says in one of her reviews, has been a lifelong Civil War fan herself. And she's going to talk about the really strange topic that we wanted to get into for a long time, Civil War movies. What they, the stuff they do, and almost more interestingly, odd amount of stuff about the Civil War that they don't do and probably can't do. So Eileen, thanks very much. Welcome to the show. Thank you. You overwhelmed me with praise, which is what I live for. So glad to be here. Good. Now that we got you all buttered up, first of all, how is it there in Buffalo because we just finally got here in Rochester, which is just an hour's drive. We finally got our first little dusting of snow today. Yeah, we did as well. And we're excited. Yeah, we did as well. But you guys, I'm saying we haven't had any this year. Oh, you never got the. No, no, no, no, that big storm that hit. Oh, it was like we had giant fans blowing everything your way. We got nothing. So I did not realize that at all. Yeah. Oh, my God, it was so awful. I mean, we got maybe an inch or two. And then it went away after a few days. We had the cold and the wind, but you guys had. Like it was like, you know, the scene, the scene, the route off the red nose reindeer, like everything is totally frozen over and stuff. Yes. And people were just dying at a rate and it was terrifying. I mean, the possibility of freezing to death in your own house became like a real thing for all of us. I saw those photos of like houses looking like, I mean, I don't know, it looked like some demon forces. I'm like, just blank it in them in ice so that they weren't even so that they were almost like stone or something. Bill, that's all those crazy. Yes. And the crazy patterns the ice made. No, exactly. It's like those houses in Charles Birchfield paintings that the one introduced me to. He's a local artist from around here from many years ago. And he makes these houses in winter that look like they're screaming either in either because they're demonic themselves or being. Yeah, it was really like that it was terrifying. The whole thing was terrifying. Yeah. I'm sorry to hear it. So you definitely got the brunt of it. So you have plenty of snowpack out there still. Yeah. Well, no, actually, I don't. It's finally come down to just ridges of ice. But for a long time, it just was, it seemed like it was, was not going to go away. But then we got such as our warm weather. Yeah. So it's been crazy weather. Yeah. Same here. I mean, we've had really warm weather here. It's, and then rain and say it's just weird anyway. It's just weird and it's going to stay weird. I know. Harder. Well, I think Shope and Hours summed it up best for the extreme depressive when he said that aging and life in general is a process in which you have to say to yourself, this is bad. And it's going to get worse until it comes to the worst of all. No, it probably sounds cheerier in German, but it's really German wood. Really bold them over and learn. Yeah. Yeah. So let's go to a cheerier time, which is not our time at the Civil War. Well, and then I guess depictions, Hollywood depictions of the Civil War, which is very important. And I don't know how you want to start this off, Eileen, when we were talking a little bit. I wanted to review a simple question like that. That I think you mentioned in your article, not so much reviewism, an article, an overview of Civil War movies. I want to see if I've got this right. There were, I think you said, 457 movies at the time you wrote about the Civil War. Is that right? That was listed by a scholar. I figured he was right. Right. And he was trying to come up with tabulations of percentages of what movies favored the South, what favored the North, what were neutral, that kind of thing. So I think that is the number he threw out there. I don't know how I don't know how right that is. But the fascinating aspect of that was he was claiming a larger percentage of films were pro-North than anything I could find. Yeah. I found that out too. This is John. I don't know how you pronounce it, Quiper. Quiper is quite, I don't know. Yeah. I'll just say John Cooper. And you cite this article or book, a quantitative description of a genre says 457 Civil War films between 1897 and 1961. Oh, so there's probably many, many hundreds more now. Yeah. And he claimed, and I agree, this is odd. It doesn't match my own memory. 29%, almost a third are what he called Northern Orientation, which I guess is pro-North. And 42% more, that is, are pro-Southern. But I would have said the disparity is much bigger. Yeah. So that's absolutely the main take of my researches on the article, was I couldn't believe how I just couldn't find almost any pro-Northern, pro-abolition, pro-union, anything to do with the North, almost impossible to find films that took that stance. You know, there is a stipulation of kind of a weird one saying any film set in the North was considered a pro-North film. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I have a feeling that the way he decided what pro-Northmen is something that would be highly debatable. But the big find, the research that I did, and I read several books and a lot of articles, is that there is the cache of truly pro-Northern, pro-union, pro-abolitionist films, were made in the early silent era. Right, right. That's amazing. Yeah. So there are the least likely films any of us would ever see. They're either most likely to be lost altogether, like the majority of silent films, or they're in archives, or who watches, you know, 1908 films, or someone doing research. So that really helps, at least, explain something. I think it's so interesting that that early on, OK, Uncle Tom's cabin in 1903 was a hit, but that spurred on some more pro-union ones, which you'd expect, because people are alive at that time who are in the Civil War, or like were kids of veterans of the Civil War, but that they made a movie that quickly escaped from Andersonville, which is kind of like Escape from, you know, Sobibor, Auschwitz, or something. And so that showed that, I mean, that's what you would expect from the victorious side. And these like Escape from Andersonville, and instead literally like that movie put a stop to it, and then you get birth of a nation instead. It's kind of amazing. Yeah, well, I think there's a lot, obviously, going on there, and there are various ways of explaining it, but the one I know best from dealing with histories of the Civil War, and literature about the Civil War, is that the lost cause myth took a while to get going. Much like, come to think of it, the lost cause myth about Vietnam, I mean, as we've said on Radio Warner many times, I remember the 70s, I'm old enough to do that. And the US finally fled Saigon in 1975. And in the movies showing heroic doomed Americans didn't really start coming until 1980, especially with the year hunter, which I think was very early 80s. And that was when it became romantic before that it was totally uncool, which was historically accurate. It was not a pleasant war if there is such a thing and in popular imagination, like it or not, there is. And that wasn't one. But after a while, they came up with a lost cause myth, and the lost cause and Vietnam was we were fighting with one hand behind our back, which was utter lie. And the lost cause myth about the Civil War, of course, is that it was a noble cause, that it was determined by an endless number of foreign mercenaries against a noble but outnumbered people. All that whole lie didn't gain any traction for at least a decade. And as late as 1879, John Logan, who was a great polemicist, I didn't newsletter about this, was still arguing don't do this. The planters want to regain control, and they mean to do it. I mean, he understood that. Nobody listened to him. And and thus, I mean, I think in literature too, in histories, the 20th century came in very nastily when it came to the Civil War. And it got worse during the World War I or Woodrow Wilson era. Wilson is one of those people. You end up not liking at all. I remember thinking him of him as one of the better emperors of the pantheon, you know, and that's not really true in a lot of ways. So nasty, nasty figure. He had some good progressive policies, but I mean, you know, I ditched all of that to just ditch the whole fucking thing. He was awful. There's also the thing I've always wondered about and wanted to read more about was with the rollout success of the lost cause narrative that ultimately is just unbelievably successful across the nation. How patchy was it like were there regions where it wasn't taking? I would have thought New England, the stronghold of abolitionism, but the glorious history in the Civil War would have resisted more. And you know, there there is a kind of argument that that you would have had more pro-Northern films in that era because the film company, all the major film studios were still in the Northeast. They were right around New York, New Jersey. And as they started chasing good weather, Princeton, Florida, and many California that you start getting this drift along with the greater and greater acceptance of lost cause stuff. Toward everything's got to be either pro-South or at least pro-Unity in the war was this kind of horrible regrettable thing that everybody went through together and tragedy. Well tragedy, that's the thing that just gets me. It's like the way that the kind of the lost cause fits neatly with the idea that it was a tragedy. We don't look at World War II as a tragedy. There were good guys and bad guys. And then you know, the Civil War is very clearly good guys and bad guys. Now there may have been people within it. I don't know who you might find a way to sympathize, but like the cause, there was a good cause and a bad cause by any goddamn standard. But it's not. It's just portrayed. And they still keep pushing that moat nearly all the time, the tragedy, the tragic element. And when you make it a tragedy, that means you have profound, deep empathy for both sides and whatever the cause is. And you know, yeah, you want to you want to there's a constant attempt unless you're blaming the North, the war of North and aggression just taking that. There's a road just over and over the attempt to just obscure how war ever started. Yes, you always skip Fort Sumter. Yes, exactly. You played a better role. Yes, I know. There was a rule. Oh my god. Yeah, you just didn't depict Fort Sumter. Really? Where did this? I mean, who in particular, where did they come from? The studios, more and more. Why? I still, but everyone reports that there were such vociferous complaints from the South about we don't we don't like seeing seeing the South represented as the losers even though well. And you know, there was that the appeasement of the South has always been huge, which in a way I don't even understand. Certainly the population isn't so great that that's your cherished, you know, that's your cherished area of the area of the country. And yet the whole, well, our whole nation's history seems to be about appeasing the South. So the studios just seem to have gotten on board like because, but I think the argument goes they found they could sell a romanticized image of the South to the North and the West too. Because I think that the North, well, especially the West having grown up in California. I grew up in a place where there were peanuts cartoons as I've said showing line is in either blue or gray cap for the centennial of the Civil War and Charlie Brown in the other sites cap. And it, but it wasn't really a balance. It was the white South that cared very, very deeply in a silent, resentful way, not everybody but a lot of them. And the North that had gone on to the making of money and had absorbed immigrants who had not grown up with those family stories about what happened to our uncle. Whereas the South, I think because it lived in a bitter stagnation after the war that very profitable for some people, but not particularly economically thriving, the kind of world that Faulkner describes. And it didn't get a lot of immigrants and didn't like the ones that got for the most part. The North, meanwhile, was having waves and waves of immigrants from everywhere in the, in the old world, as they called it, then in the early 20th century and was also getting very, very rich. I don't think they cared very much. So it was a lot simpler to appease the people who, the white South basically who did care very deeply. And it made for easier movies too. But this tradition of appeasement goes way, way back to 1865. Well, it goes back to back well before it comes back. It goes all the way back and probably further. But I mean, even at their lowest point, the Southern elite was continuing a tradition of arrogance, such that at one point when William to come to Sherman himself, who was trying to arrange a surrender of troops in the lower South because Grant was handling it up in Virginia. He was in the Carolinas. And these people who had been utterly defeated, well, and largely thanks to Sherman, were so demanding at these talks that Sherman finally had to say, see here gentlemen, who is doing the surrender today? Yeah. So look at it from a difference. I wonder if they put out movie after movie about, you know, about what it was fought over, which was slavery and a free this, you know, basically end slavery versus protecting slavery, where blacks would have to be really the good guys and blacks would have to be the, you know, the people you sympathize with. And how dangerous that could have been and that might have, I mean, how potentially dangerous that would be to, I mean, middle and upper middle class American white Americans at that time in the South, but also in the North. Right. And if racism really necessitates you sidelineing the whole narrative of slavery, like experience is so much easier to go with this other narrative with the worth of a nation's narrative, where, where what's being threatened here are the white brothers of the North and the South are being. And the South are being divided and imperiled by the rise of a black empire. And that's a line, even if you have to bury it a bit that goes right on from from birth of a nation, that's how you get the tragedy narrative. So birth of nation, if I recall, right, came out in 1915, right? Yeah, the 50 year anniversary. Yeah, that's right. We again, the Wilson era, very nasty. Your America was well, it was a segregationist. I mean, he actually, I think I think he up segregation in Washington DC, but he was a pro segregationist Democrat. Which often gets lost if you're studying the progressive era and you think, oh, we were making such great strides there, but it's a tricky era. Yeah, but it was, it was such a film phenomenon. If you study film history, you're forced. You must reckon with birth of a nation, which of course gets worse all the time. I was shown it. I was probably the last generation of film students to be shown it in a very bland way. Like they would still just show it to you without context. I mean, I almost wish I do that. Well, I don't know. Maybe I, I sing it at this age after everything. I, and I don't really usually get overly shocked by movies. I watched it last night. And, and it's, I mean, it's, it's surprisingly well done for the only silent movies I'm mostly familiar with are Charlie Chaplin. And then there are little things and I just kind of expect those really funny looking hop-ity people. So it's very well done, but, but the movie made me sick to my, like physically sick. It is such just straight up fascist lies. I don't, and I did, I did not, like I knew it wasn't like I thought, oh, birth of a nation. This might be very, you know, progressive or might not. I already knew that it was a pro-cland movie and it says so right in the beginning, you know. But, um, damn, it's just, it, it's sicking me on two levels. One was the obvious, you know, the lies about slavery and it was start of the war and so on. The other thing is you're supposed to, and this is a common theme while certainly like gone with the wind so on, you're supposed to somehow not just not be sick and by but be it totally enamored of these vials really rich. Yeah. I don't know, the French era of starker city before the guillotine's came in. They took care of him. Like they're so horrible and disgusting. Their lives are like you, you just think I'm going to become a fucking Bolshevik. Like this movie is going to make me a Bolshevik and just kill them all. And yet, and yet, you know, that's where I just don't understand people like who watches that and thinks, you know, oh, those were the days. That was such a, it's not even that there, it's not even the slavery necessary. It's more like the costumes, the letter writing, the big hairdo. The dances. Yeah, the dance is exactly. It's just endless costume balls. Yeah. Yeah. I admit I've only seen clips of birth of a nation. I gather the whole thing is more than three hours long. It's hard to imagine seeing one of those as Mark puts it, hoppity movies for three hours. But I do know that, yeah, as you, much younger than me, Eileen were sculpting one of the, maybe the last generation to be taken to certain films as a school group. My English class in high school around 1972 maybe was dragged to a century, 21th theater to see Gone with the Wind. Yeah. And I never quite figured out why, but then a lot of films that were considered to be part of the American curriculum didn't, we're not as self evidently canonical or for such self evident reasons. As, as whoever assigned them thought, because I couldn't see as a civil war fan, what Gone with the Wind told anybody about the Civil War? Or you puzzle, do you remember what they talked about, Joe? Like after the movie? No, honestly, I remember a lot of fancy dresses and, um, see what I mean, I mean your teacher or anything like what was supposed to be the takeaway from watching it? Or was there just like, you can remember just some sort of apples smoking in the back of the room? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was their takeaway. She's like, I can, I can get rid of three and a half hours. Well, and it's so awkward for film history that the two perhaps most phenomenal films in Hollywood history, at least if you take us up to the end of the studio, our birth of a nation to go with the wind, both just insane levels of success. Birth of a nation the more important one, just historically. It's the reason you say it's good is because it's DW Griffith and infuriating Lee, he's a great filmmaker. Yeah. So having to negotiate, he's a great filmmaker and he's just a, ideologically, he's a total monster. Is he, I don't know anything about him. Oh, pro Southern aristocrat all the way, even though he was poor, but he was poor Southern. But he worshiped the Confederacy. There was the whole nine yards. So yeah, he brought, he brought all this gushing, you know, love and reverence to the subject, but he's just so, he's so damn skilled. I mean, speaking of Bolsheviks, the Russians were just taking chapter in verse DW Griffith because as they said, he's the only American who can edit. He's the only one and they were wrong. So the battle, there are a couple of battle scenes that are still beautiful. So yeah, he was, I mean, the, like, this around this time, I had to turn it off because it just made me so sick. It was done so well about an hour in where there's this Southern mother, sort of like cuddling, like protecting her three poor, you know, be dragiled children, Southern children, high up on a hill hiding in like bushes and grass. And down below, you see this, just basically they're depicted as like the Nazi hordes or something, which is the Union Army sweeping through below. Yeah, absolutely. And they're just up there vulnerable and doomed and, you know, the mother is the little turtles charge when he leaves the dragles. And then they run across the field, totally outnumbered a course, but try to be on belief. And he spikes a cannon with the Confederate flag. I didn't see that very briefly shot. But yeah, at every level, the film is twisted and evil. Guess how they portray Thaddeus Stevens. Oh, yeah, that was the most shocking thing. Thaddeus Stevens is one of the most heroic figures. Yes. I mean, there's John Brown, but for obvious reasons, pacifists aren't big fans. But Thaddeus Stevens never did any violence in his life and he gave his life to pushing justice. It's pretty much that simple. And he did a great cause. He caused us so bad in this movie. Yeah, and they made him into a monster. Oh, he's a monster. He's he's he's gimpant because you know, the clubfoot is is known in the and the wig, the bad wig are known. So they use those to make him this twist physically twisted little gargoyle. And he's he's in love and sexually enthralled to his mulatto. I'm using quote unquote the old term word from mixed race. Mistress, which of course is slandering his actual maybe chooses housekeeper. I forget her name now. I had it in the article. Anyway, and she was taking it as a as a freak to. No, it's cold. Yeah, just what is she even doing so horrible? Yeah, she ride this all the time. It's making it she's getting raped and then turning him on with her stories of being raped and it wants to rape. It's so Lydia Hamilton Smith, his housekeeper mentioned the mirror novel as you say. Well, one thing that that I wonder about and I wanted to ask you about, I mean, there's one thing that has to be acknowledged that the the planters could summon a lot of other much poorer southern whites who were. And then this has certain echoes voting some and fighting against their own interests, though occasionally they they realize otherwise. And that made them scary and there was a lot of fear just plain old fear of of those people. And if you didn't really care very much about black people, well, why not? You know, why not buy their allegiance to the American project by letting them have what struck most northern white Americans as maybe an odd. But irrelevant myth. I mean, you're not really supposed to care that much about history anyway in mainstream American culture. And these things especially seem to appear when you need not just acceptance, but enthusiastic acceptance of the American project. Like as I recall, Hamilton went appeared in 1959, 1939. And this horrible film with Andrew Johnson that has the hero and that he Stevens as the monster came out in 1942, which right. So it would have been made just as the US was facing the fact that it was going to have to go into the big one. Right. So they needed that demographic. And maybe they paid them off more at that point. No, one of the shining things about reading about how the craziness of the narrative has a period of intensification and it's crazy as you head into World War II and fight the war is because unity above all, at least unity among certain groups, becomes the watchword, but their version of trying to do it is things like this completely twisted celebration of Andrew Johnson in this movie where that he Stevens is evil because he's trying to get him impeached of course. And it's because they could sell Johnson to the region of the South. Yeah, they need these people. And they, but their version of appeasing they also in during the war there were again rules were sort of sent down from the government saying we've got to stop with the more virulent aspects of racism because we now have people of color serving with distinction in the armed services and again unity unity unity. So they would if you read the histories of some of these films, they would actually be taking out the worst, but they're leaving in things that you're like really. That wasn't considered the word so they would take out the most wild like gone with the wind is a good example you watch gone with the wind and you can't believe they worked really hard to remove all the most insultingly racist stuff because you're like what. So there's no take out. Oh, they for example, it's the mem the the characters are members of the clan when they there's a scene if you know going well you've seen it where they go to avenge the attack on Scarlet or her and they're going to clean out the quote unquote. Shanti town. When she's in that carriage and her driver has to yeah, and the black man and a there's a black attacker and a white attacker so it's supposed to be poor whites gone wrong and and freed slaves. So it's the Ashley Wilkes rep butler and all these other people go to clean it out and it's it's a clan thing they're remember you know they're actually is a member of the clan. But so they can't that can't be shown and they certainly can't have roads you know they can't have any where they originally filmed in the classic clan roads. No, they never were because okay weirdly enough for all of its huge success and influence birth of a nation was an enormously controversial film I mean the end of lcp. Mounted enormous protests it was it was really was very controversial and the lesson was learned like we don't want to go quite that controversial. That is another interesting point of this article of yours and I think I'd better mention the title again. This is a lot of cause right yeah by Alene Jones in Jacobin. You said this in the article on I was pleasantly surprised for once which is yeah the the end wcp had the power even in 1915 to together big demonstrations. That had some sort of an effect and again there's a because there's a very it's not like it's for noble reasons there is a big appeasing quality of the Hollywood studio system whenever they possibly could they would avoid the worst you know the worst most controversial stuff if it was easy to do but it's little like removing a couple of words here or there or taking the actual robes away or not shooting the scene directly but referring to it things like that so you're reading these just tiny tiny concessions but but nevertheless there was a kind especially is the you're moving toward war. And more and more you know the government is saying we just don't we don't want the more the more vitriolic horrible stuff you've got to tamp it down a little bit so they were by the by the standards of the day but then you watch gone with the wind and you're like really. This is the tamped down nice and up smooth over version yeah well I think now that I think of it I mean I'm sure you know that all this better than I do but offhand I can only remember. One scene there's no is there a battle beside the only soldier that is that I can remember being killed in that movie is the would be rapist to get shot on the stairs yeah yeah sort of deserter from Sherman's army who's a bummer in Sherman's terms yeah who's menacing scarlet or here yeah yeah a forager yeah the question of whether there were mass rapes or or a lot of folks by the way against civilian women during Sherman's March when a lot of soldiers were dispersed to for just they called it something of a euphemism in the countryside has a kind of awful answer as far as I can tell they tended to rape enslaved women. I think there were very few cases at least proved of raping white women in the south but they they many times raped enslaved women and girls but we're talking about Victorian anglos so it's actually it was actually a very difficult question to mention at all you had to somehow arouse. If you were a lost cause activist you had to arouse rage and I mean very deep rage without saying anything explicit and that led to all kinds of elaborate euphemisms and also to not having any very good information about what when who and how many. Yeah there's there is there's a little more in the book the constant terror of it though I don't think there are any depictions but look at birth of a nation there's a story line where it is just the constant rampaging black male there's a character devoted to that if you have his name in the narrative and doesn't he drive the one of the young southern family the southern planter family women right off a cliff I can remember she didn't get that far like I said but I was in the part where there there led sort of. Wild by a union you know bad northern and the the women are like chase basically they have to hide down in a basement terrified yeah from these from blacks with guns right running around their house just breaking things yeah for women yes with the first the first thing they're going to do with these go for yes go for the white women yes yeah so that's all very much softened in the attack on scarlet o'hara is a romantic fainting in the image of of scarlet o'hara and it's though I believe it's the white man leaning over her the soldiers he kills is definitely white oh definitely he's definitely white yes yes so they again that that would be 1939 version of softening I was going to say you know politically also at that time though you know FDR's new deal coalition was I mean the southern Democrat white Democrats made up an important part I don't I don't know how much that sort of hot you know top level politics influences any of this huge okay oh they were absolutely Hollywood was just hand in love with the government yeah okay throughout the world war two is just remarkable for yeah them to say what do you what do you want what do you need right and we will be in in the movies yeah right yeah looney tunes was definitely very enthusiastic about the war that's that's my main film history knowledge yeah all the all the ones that you can't see you can't see the vault there yeah yeah that are yeah violently racist and so on which is yeah yeah there's another strain of you might call the portus strain I mean portus Charles portus author of Trugrid and I'd say his best novel dog of the south gringoes masters of Atlantis and a really superb pro stylist from Arkansas was pretty much a neo Confederate and got more so as he went along so that there's a line in the last novel he wrote gringoes a Mexican character he says you know why I'm depressed the Yankees took half my country in 1846 and Jimmy Burns the protagonist says you know they took all of mine in 1865 so you know where portus stands I'm not you Ross for example is a big fan of Woodrow Wilson I'm not you Ross is his invented right first person narrator for Trugrid and a great great voice one of the great voices but there's another movie that came out of that from more of an action novelist that I'm talking about the outlaw Josie wilds which is like wheels many of these a good movie with a really nasty yeah ideology behind but it's it's not in your face the way birth of a nation was yeah you can you can think of eastwood uh who's the protagonist as just a man or rather a superman in difficult circumstances but he happens to be a Confederate veteran and that means a lot in terms of the film well and you do open on that don't they burn his entire farm and they yeah don't they rape his yeah wife and daughter and kill and then they kill his unit which is Confederate unit which is trying to surrender with a gatling gun which is utter nonsense right like that ever happened and the more you focus on the civil war aspects the the more grotesque man and part is in it seems but I think most people don't need to do that um no I thought it was a kid I did you guys see it when it came out because I remember seeing it as a kid and and thinking it was a really good movie I mean again I was a kid and I didn't want it what it was okay okay yeah I mean that's the thing I guess this comes up several times in in this discussion it's probably may as well say it I am me I don't see any reason that you shouldn't have a horrible person to have this be good at right making a certain kind of thing whether it's shoes or movies or yeah or whatever why not I mean that making good movies or books as far as I know it doesn't imply any kind of moral superiority and look at literary by hook faith and you can find a lot of yeah proof that it doesn't so I'm not even sure it's a paradox but uh happens a lot anyway yeah it just poses a huge challenge to people of our time for some yeah yeah yeah it seems to get to get around the hurdle of while what an utter shit bastard but boy that's a good novel I don't know why that's hard but we were raised in a different era yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that brings us to our era and you've written I gotta tell everybody you have written amazing reviews in the last decade about this groups this cohort or generations attempt to do the Civil War um I think my favorite is uh your review of Nate Parker's uh yeah birth he called it birth of a nation but it's the netterner is not smart either and yeah about the netterner rebellion and Eileen just says outright there that um we shouldn't even try to make movies like this because uh basically we don't have the sensibility or more crudely we don't have the guts you know something like that yeah and maybe even we don't have the imagination we're we're just into about where people can no longer imagine their way into it and and our interest in it in it which is shocking to me because yeah because I was trying to convey because you know it's not like we have the jailhouse confessions of netterner I mean we he's it's an extraordinary thing um that his his whole conception was very complete but it was very old testament very very it was you was yeah you know I kind of cosmic view of the role of Christ and who's calling him to lead this rebellion and he had visions that were bloody and beautiful and so I go to this movie thinking uh finally somebody's gonna do it it's so cinematic it's gonna be unbelievable and in every way it's just it's just the most imaginatively impoverished thing I'd ever seen there literally looks like a victorious secret model his black who comes flying up with angels wings as part of his vision I'm just like what the hell you do it and the the main thing that netterner wanted to get across in jail is his way to be executed is everyone's trying to get him to say it's because your master was cruel to you right that you just snapped and you went on a rampage and he was and he insisted no he was kind to me he gave me many responsibilities because he you know he treated me well yeah he was trying to refuse the whole it's because he had a mean master right right yeah they put it right back in so it's all about the specific abuses of netterner and his wife by the evil slaveholder it's almost outlawed Josie whale story isn't it's like like they came in and raped my wife and therefore I think it's yeah yeah it's never happened that there's no nothing in the record nothing like that and it's so against what he was trying to get across it doesn't matter for master's nice yeah yeah yeah yeah still that right yeah yes so it's that was heartbreaking that was just hard yeah to see that one and it's been pretty heartbreaking to watch to watch these films I mean sometimes it's kind of funny like emancipation watching the latest one the Will Smith one where it's action film Will Smith vehicle combined with yeah it's a it's a famous photo that seems to started that one the the horribly scarred back of an X slave usually identified as someone named Gordon but the photo is called the scourged back and it's great for propaganda scars standing out on his bear back but yeah somehow and again they have the narrative he gave an account of it to I think the medics who treated him so we have the account it was so promising again you know because he had to escape through the Louisiana swamps to do so I got to read this I got to read this little bit but at every turn in Fuku's movie the already amazing story is pump full of gratuitous tall tail action hero nonsense it reaches its nature when Peter I guess that's Will Smith right already weakened by a bullet wound and hiding in the swamp to escape the relentless slave hunters on his trail is attacked by a massive alligator I live in as a massive alligator fights in a protracted roiling battle underwater and wins you can hardly roll your eyes hard enough to express absurd this scene is but save your eye rolling ability for the bee and snake attacks because all of nature is that to get Peter during his oh boy okay now I want to watch that yeah that's he's got a word yeah yeah because he by sees just soup ease will Smith always has to be a kind of Superman yeah and so that's what it is rampaging through the Louisiana swamps you should have just slapped the alligator I know I just punched him in the nose I remember an Australian expert on crocodilians said oh yeah jumping into a bill of bong and fighting a giant saltwater crock underwater that's roughly like fighting a a vogue swagon yeah I know and it just you know it's funny but it's also infuriating I'm gonna respect the animal respect the animal yeah I gotta just read another little bit here because you know obviously the slap hard around the world and the movie didn't do well and they blamed it on on Will Smith slap hard around the world and as you right here the publicity campaign for emancipation was called Will Smith's quote apology tour in the Wall Street journal but there's a simpler explanation for the for the films on popularity it's pretty bad probably glad they had to excuse but the reason one you liked I think was one I didn't see I have to admit I don't I didn't get the the streaming service or whatever it is the good lord bird right you like some of that I did I liked it and typically perverse of a film critic I I never went back and finished this area but I loved the first what two episodes I think it's sketch six yeah it's a it's of all people Ethan Hawk pulls off the titanic role of John Brown but they and they know approach to it and it's based on a novel by I'm blanking I guess it was a hugely successful respected novel I forget but anyway is a very you know extreme absurdist tall tale but it's still it still has tremendous resonance and John Brown will always come through with these kind of shards of brilliance but he's kind of this ranting mad freak figure and it's about you know a young slave that he kind of takes under his wing and it's from the point of view of his name is Henry Shackleford of of this teenage boy who's brought in on on the the whole you know a little sort of private campaign of John Brown with his sons and everything else and it wants to include with you know real real elements of greatness real elements of truly American madness and religious fanaticism all the rest of it and it just a wild you know comedy drama mix that I was so it was so refreshing and so like beyond what I thought anyone would attempt that I was really thrilled with that yeah yeah one of the reasons I didn't you know enrol in the uh streaming service that that had that was Ethan Hawk I mean I know it always looks tired and snotty and I can't not even I know it's one it's amazing what you know that that kind of Hawk like you know hair standing up and appeared and all the rest of it can really helps a lot he should never wear his air any other way but you raise a really interesting point that has a lot to do with trying to construe the people involved in the US Civil War and a lot of other events of that period the question of uh was John Brown insane and uh one of the things that happened to me when I started reading more intensely for our our radio-warnard civil war series was that if you took a big sample of civil war generals both sides uh all different armies a lot of them would be described as uh borderline crazy in yeah in my own youth and now because many more people are getting diagnosed in childhood as uh being in the idiom of a few years go on the spectrum uh i think virtually all of them would and and so to the point that it started to seem like you can't talk about a particular general being insane because they all were uh and so that it becomes a non-sequitur and you can't use it as a mitigating circumstance and you begin to think what does it mean anyway it means they would not have seemed normal in our world but duh well maybe that's that's why you don't have to worry about time travel it doesn't work that way um and i mean Braxton Bragg for example of Confederate famous Confederate general who was maybe the most hated man and in any command once according to an apocryphal story that could well be true he had to equaled with everybody he ever met and eventually because of illness he was required to take two jobs on the same post like he was in charge of supplies and he was in charge of drill or whatever and supposedly he wrote a furious letter to the supply officer which was himself on behalf of the officer who was in charge of drill which was himself a lot of them are like that i mean that the the frequency with which civil war generals kill each other and not always in duels more like shoot somebody in the back of the ad coming out of a pub that happened a lot um so yeah the question of and then this goes way beyond the civil war but you talk about it really brilliantly in that article is like what do you do with the idea of uh someone who's crazy according to the contemporary definitions is it a mitigating factor first of all or not uh i i don't know but it's a it's a very big question because i don't know all insults are ableist no cultural moment can live without insult i don't know how that ends i guess it has to be endlessly renegotiated well and a lot depends on your own stance toward crazy for me i always feel very much at home reading about the 19th century because i just feel a cousinly sense of identification i mean there's almost no nothing you can read that's extensive that doesn't bring you into the world of constant like mental drift into other states they're either having wild premonitions of their own death like link in or there or there's some of which seem to come true or they're going into what they used to call brain fever which would be fits fits of illness or didn't seem to have a physical cause but just put people in bed for six months where they were raving and out of their heads or just all sorts of hallucinatory experiences all that religious very very intense religious forever you know so by our standards they were out of their heads more than in so it just seems like brown is on such a continuum you know that turn that turner yeah that turner and you know i i come i tried to ground it by saying look at you know link in second inaugural he's using language that sounds like something that turner might have said you know about you know the every drop of blood drawn from you know the lash let to be paid by another drawn from the sword you know this whole you know the the ways the lord or true and righteous etc you know this kind of move that they would make mentally readily that we know regard as you can't even refer to that or talk about that or or assist which I know right well i think mark has also worked on this in a really useful way on in going postal on the question of hmm you know were these guys just mentally ill and it's this always reminds me of that of sfidru guy loves line before he kills himself in and prime imponishment which is okay maybe you're right and i only see ghosts because i'm out of my mind but the fact that ghosts only appear to insane people doesn't prove there are no ghosts i gotta write that down that's when my story lines of yours is my whole family history i got and as mark said and i may be paraphrasing this badly that uh there are absolutely valid reasons to stage a workplace uprising not the same ones but uh rough well somewhat parallel to any other uprising any insurgencies uh survival or otherwise but they strike certain people first a lot of more fleckmatic or if you like sane or normal people we'll put up with it until they die and right but we tend to consider sanity is very recognizable in terms of the discussion in it that there's a kind of quietism like no one must royal royal the waters yeah that's that's akin to to losing your mind so this whole idea of we mustn't we we if you're going to make a move away from favoring the south altogether then you have to start saying war is madness war is hell that's the move that you start getting in the you know 50s 60s right in doha for example 65 so because i kept thinking surely when i get to the civil rights era right you'll start to see you know pro union pro-abolition you don't you still don't you start you get yeah you get nervous bland pacifist films about just war being bad and chanandowa has speeches about that who who's who's in chanandoga again can you just start that story right exactly he's playing the patriarch of a virginia family who's trying to stay neutral in the war which i can't even finish that sense of that laughing so he's serious yeah that's on the watch chanandowa i love to see you yeah that's it that's the hit song from that from that movie it's all it's all and you can go to you know mustn't have big fusses like wars and the family is all important and unite them and it's also he's a small farmer not a big planner right and he he runs like a you know a little democracy workshop it is with his family at his own dinner table and so that's a big advance over those plantations that are you know lionized in those earlier films yeah that's true that's a really big advance that's there i guess that's the most important when did plantations go from being a nice backdrop for a fairy tale i mean really like like a real fairy tale land of yeah well played scarlet o'hara or what's her name Vivian Lee she's a British actress yeah some actress back then yeah um as she's called in uh Confederacy of Dances scarlet o'hara and god knows why actually it's an interesting question why did she become scarlet o'hara because that would be a pretty unusual name oh i could tell you the whole story i used to be a fervent as a child literally third grade gone with a wind fan really great reading this poem and they rebuked me for it saying you can't read that it's too adult i was like the novel it's a thousand pages and i'm reading it yeah it's a great melodrama i mean if you if you can ignore again the horrifying ideology the thing it's it's it's it works on the level and then and it really works as a Hollywood melodrama but anyway her whole background is this she's supposed to be split evenly between a jumped up Irishman who manages to win a plantation in a poker game and an aristocratic mother he saw the mother he meant his to marry so that's the explanation of what was going to wind the film i it grant you i've only watched parts of the film uh but the the father had this kind of Irish accent yeah it's time is Mitchell he's a famous and i wish America going like yeah that that didn't make any sense in the south i know yeah so he he manages to crash the gates and get accepted in a way he never would have been because he wins this thing but at any rate she that's the explanation for why she's so wild and impossible and it's an appropriate southern lady it's just got a half wild Irish blood wild Irish yeah yeah supposedly i've read analyses of the accounts saying this this move the novel was already just a colossal bestseller before the film was such a huge hit and part of it they said was that even it had it hit every button certainly in America it even had an immigrant kind of tale which is the Irish right yeah they were they were getting served up in um movies at that time yeah a lot because there's always some groups that's getting served up in tight mainstream movies right there's another film that's really interesting because it came out i think around 1971 again with Clint Eastwood at the Beguiled oh yeah strange cool how is it kind of wow i haven't seen that one oh you got to see it because it's like a single-blow like a civil war movie although far inferior to the great north field minnesota raid which has something to do with the civil war also but it was remade that's the interesting thing by none other than your own favorite my favorite yeah yeah and she she takes all the psychedelic all the sexual fever dream all all the everything good and interesting about the first and and tries to make a blandly sense-making film and it can't work that way so she's trying to make a kind of pro women narrative as they take on this interloper who uses yeah that is the story it's a union soldier Yankee soldier yeah who use yeah he's using his sexual wiles to keep the women from turning him over to the Confederate army yeah so he can and he's a Yankee and he's very bad i remember very distinctly like i'm it's 1972 i'm in high school i'm basically uh well totally uh out of it for various reasons and they i go to see this movie with my class and it begins with eastward um shooting for no particular reason this southern soldier who's disarmed or something and can't threaten him in any way and i remember even then thinking what why did he do that that's that's funny oh and there's a song playing that's like something like don't let mama don't it's sort of don't let mothers don't let your sons go off to be soldiers so it's again it's got this way so it's mama's don't let your babies put to be cowboys but not all it's soldiers it's not that song but it's that's the message so it's again blaming the war on everyone having gone mad so it's again another of these pacifist wars hell and it creates these yeah yeah yeah and the sexual tension included literally every female including the little 12-year-old girl 12-year-old i remember her screaming when he kills her turtle that was quite a moment because they essentially you know symbolically cast rate him by re-break he's he's wounded and they re-break his leg push him downstairs or something is it because he's you know working them all he's seducing them all and promising all everything and they push him downstairs or something and he re-breaks it so badly and then they just think they just use that as a reason to amputate his leg and so that he's mad he's mad he's threatening to you know to go on this huge rampage and that's when he kills picks up the turtle and throws against him while kills the turtle and the other one is like god i know i know i guess very tricky but it's really interesting because you know Clint Eastwood hated looking back on it because it failed and he said you know right nobody wanted to see me like that for a using his sexual while on all the women which is very eastwood actually but also being a loot unemasculated loser so i mean that was why he blamed you know the film didn't do well but it's such a weird ass film i really actually love the film because i want to see it now i can't i guess that's why i didn't see it because it flopped and as you say but unsurprisingly the French loved it oh yeah that's what yeah and it has a wonderful deal with all that old Sophie nothing she does almost off she looks sort of keeps the bare bones he does seduce them all and they do get their revenge on him but it's supposed to be all about oh these poor women you know so oppressed in their society and blah blah blah and then he naturally you know reaps the whirlwind of their oppression but it just makes no sense she she gives no she will not deal with the fact that that of any with any fact so there are no one of the first complaints you know by critics was there there are no black people in the south in the south like none and she even eastwood's version there was one although it's a major character yeah yeah who's the one who has to do most of the leave it to Sophia Copeland oh she's not she's so perfect oh she's more about slavery and racism and she makes it about like whatever oh my god so her explainer her dialogue in the thing is the slaves left that's her only explanation you put in dialogue in the movie and outside of it she defended herself by saying she only wanted to deal with gender politics not yeah this is she picked one issue at a time but you know there's no like there's no shortage of food there's no patch clothing they so so none of the realities of real in the movie you're just like even birth of a nation has the patched clothes like every every little women you know at the old time they always make a big deal about the the clothes the clothes are terrible and tady and andlessly repatched it yeah nothing there she gives no she will not give any territory over to actual on the crown reality so it's really she's like I mean she's like five star mediocrity I really mean the opportunity almost gives a mediocrity a bad name she there's just something about her she why guess what she said about the south she goes to the south for the first time and says oh no did it was so exotic and different oh I remember a discussion about that in Berkeley with yeah oh there it was like yeah oh the more direct the horrible pressures that's that's good that's but well no no actually you don't know what you're talking about but at least yeah jangle on chain which is another civil roughly civil well no pre civil war I guess yeah at least there were some direct scenes like when you have if you're gonna kill people for a living you got to kill that guy farming and his kids got to come out and cry over the body that happens you know that I kind of appreciated that scene I like that movie better than you I don't know what you thought about it I don't know I know you did I think I had I just expected something so told you well you had seen the script and you were like wow and that might have ruined it like seeing a Christmas present before it comes but I mean it's not his best movie by any stretch but I just thought it was more I had more energy and life and ups and downs and just it was more of a spectacle than most and that and that is what I liked about the overall he gave us a series of interviews before he before he did it saying the way we need to reclaim the whole at least the slavery narrative is we we really we really need to start doing great genre versions of it and bringing this kind of you know liveliness and everything because he says this PBS thing we've done to it right has didn't it yes for everyone and I thought that's exactly right that's exactly so I was so but I had really gotten it into my head that he was doing a slave rebellion movie so I was so thwarted and when there was no slave rebellion in fact there seemed to be a point being made that which I couldn't quite track about him being unable to draft any other slave so it just made Django kind of this he's the towering thing but no one else would join him no I couldn't quite follow but anyway no that's interesting because there has there been a slave rebellion movie by any American other than the map turn or attempt yeah but I mean in a we didn't roots have some of that oh I guess it did yeah yeah I think we should point out here to I know I can't remember either that one roots came Alex Haley yeah also ghost road I think Malcolm X's autobiography right or or co-rider or something but that was made into a TV series in the 70s I mean I you can't really call it you can call it a leading up to the Civil War I guess series but that that that was one of the most impactful oh yeah I was glued to that TV events I mean in my lifetime it was yeah I don't think there's anything close to it it had a huge cultural that was a TV movie at a time of series TV series yes they weren't cool at all they weren't yes and then these were us came after that and that's kind of what made the Holocaust that was with Merrill Streep and it kind of made her career and it also kind of made like the Holocaust because it wasn't quite front and center before at least in as I recall until the Holocaust series came out one thing about that that comes out in Eileen's review of Nat Turner as you say in the review Nat Turner said and acted on it every member of the planter families have that has to be killed yes and the dead and children yes how you how you can do a Nat Turner rebellion movie without any of that exactly it doesn't do it oh they they the implication is I think that they are doing but you're not allowed to see it so you only see them go after the the the specific men who were abusive right right and so it's really chickening out in just a terrible way you hey if you're not going to deal with that Turner don't do that turn I just get drives me crazy but I think it's almost because the culture you know the culture might have had a hard time with it because there's so much lost causes and yeah forcing through our veins absolutely that it's not like if you had you know Jewish partisans going into some German town like it would be okay that they kill the family of you know camp guards and the whole family I think people would be able to deal with it or there'd be the sort of like fake moral ambiguity but you know had to do it sort of think I don't think people are a large audience anyway is ready for that what he did which was kill families yeah and he spared any of the like the small farmer classes if you weren't brown like last year they went right by yeah right so there was this absolute judgment of what who had to die it's interesting in emancipation I didn't mention it but there actually is a shot of a little girl who's the child of one of the planter families screaming in a really monstrous way supposed to be this child of evil she sees the runaway Peter played by Will Smith and starts screaming runner runner runner she looks like something you know I don't know I don't even know what something in a horror movie I'm thinking that invasion of the body snatch it's very much very much shot like that it's a kind of shock shot on our face that seems to be a gesture toward you know they're they're all filled with this ideology you can't just leave yeah yeah leave these people to just rebuild the same society again which is of course essentially what they did yeah version of it but um yeah so that I was that was one interesting sort of interesting moment I guess but but it was such an anomaly I didn't even write about no yeah after I read your review I was trying to think who what well not who as an individual I mean what in the culture could do who could yeah turn a rebellion I just can't even yeah it would be yeah that's why I was so shocked when I saw I've always wanted someone to do it but I was so shocked when I saw they actually were doing it like wow okay I hope you've got the guts for this but they always messed it up I mean it it was a kind of minor version of the Harriet Tubman story came on a couple years ago and the same week you know and with her there's none of that you don't have to worry she just rescuing slaves yeah she's not going and but she also had visions she had visions because she's they you know if yours you know you believe the scientific explanation she was horribly she was hit on the head with some sort of iron weight forget what it was sort of farm implement that cracked her skull and she wasn't expected to live and when she came out of it she was she was seeing visions and hearing God talk to her she always claimed that's how how she could navigate this one she could just do the impossible things that that's how that's cool so they were going to do the visions and it was the same thing it's like they go to the most generic like there's a cash of dream imagery that they go to and like yes let's have a rippling stream and little little tinkling bell sounds and I'm like no Harriet you must save them Harriet yeah yeah so well yeah well there aren't many movies that that deal with as as you say altered states very well certainly not the one movie that was called that actually eraser had to me is always the best yeah lich is good yeah usually pretty good he always can do yeah that's his good one of his great gifts yeah but it's a difficult thing I know when I was trying and failing to write fiction I tried to do dreams and I discovered it is hard to do dreams yeah or visions or skits of frenic whatever it's tough yeah it's it is but yeah go ahead well I'm just going to say in some case you have accounts that's what's frustrating that's very good point yeah fiction Schmixen just write what they just wrote what it was yeah yeah so I want to let's go back to I don't know another part of this start I mean we're talking civil war movies we should talk I think about um battle scenes and one one thing you like like civil war battles as depicted in movies one thing you point out it's really true is that for some damn reason as far as I know there's no um there's no movie about Sherman I mean the most photogenic of all genitals or Sherman grand is also very foot and so interesting grand and as like the greatest you know autobiography of any president bar none and when Len tenrickson was was young enough he could have been Sherman with no makeup down oh yeah I mean and and you know compared to like the fancy pants we I mean patent is a will he's a nothing compared to a George he's got as much more better than the real patent I think but like compared to Sherman he's just not nearly as interesting oh no you know as I always say you're coming through areas of Hollywood filmmaking when yeah when the the glorifying biopic was like amazing yeah and they they gave them to everybody but not to not to create they only would do Lincoln and and then even that yeah avoiding controversial Lincoln by making it young young mr. Lincoln Abe Lincoln in Illinois or we can fan the hair killer that's different yeah that civil war movie ever but yeah but they make any about Robert E Lee I wonder surprisingly I don't even know one of Robert E Lee though it's interesting to know that the cult of Robert E Lee is only recently started to fall apart yes they start only isn't there a Robert E Lee character in gods in generals I seem to remember no well certainly in Gettysburg yeah both of those but I don't think you played by our car profile and that's right you're just dying to get to Gettysburg John I think you should go for it it does have some great battle scenes but I also want to mention a movie that probably wasn't it wasn't a great movie but it did have a scene that that did suggest in a way that most don't the flat out terrifying nature of a civil war battle and that was glory where there's a scene where these troops who I think were in their first battle are having to stand while yes cannon just rip through their ranks yeah first of all that suggests that Matthew Broderick it was a really bad officer Robert Gould Shaw was a bad officer because you're you're supposed to tell your all your troops to lie down that's when an officer comes into his own he's supposed to stand and then tell the troops to get up when it's time for them to fire their first volley but it didn't always happen so that that was real in that way and it's one of the most difficult to imagine things I can find in any movie because it's one thing to do pick its charge with you know those big strings of an of an orchestra and Gettysburg and everybody falling operatically but it's quite another to stand there silent not moving at all and occasionally now and then I can involve splatters somebody to roast the right yeah yeah that I remember thinking and that was pretty good movie except Broderick it was just weird maybe maybe in the end I don't know maybe if I saw it now it'd be different it was just sort of like Ferris I know I had the same feeling when I said I and I kept thinking they're they're trying to characterize him is that's why is he supposed to be sort of a weenie little I don't mean what he was he was very much upper upper class Boston but yeah if they think that was weenie they don't really understand right yeah isn't it um Eileen I mean is it just a case of they they found somebody to anchor the movie and his stock was still pretty he was stock I was and he was looking for a role that was more dramatic right right right so Matthews people talk to these people right right did lunch and yeah right exactly and for a long time glory was pretty much what you what you could hold up is like this is this is a good so yeah yeah it's pretty sparse I just wanted to get back to if you don't mind me doing this just back to Civil War battles like do you have a sense of how battle scenes kind of I don't I mean like I realized as yeah as I was gonna talk to you guys I thought oh geez I hope they can make up for this because suddenly I'm like blanking like most of the ones I'm dealing with it's amazing how you don't see battles yeah right most of them don't have most of them don't have it I think actually it's expensive it's a it's especially difficult to find people thin enough to place the war soldiers so sometimes the camera and getty's bird battle scenes couldn't pan fast enough like whoa what has that regiment been eating now I was thinking too though about the spaghetti western was particularly good and bad and the ugly I can't remember if the Civil War is a backdrop to any of the other ones but it is a backdrop yeah wouldn't surprise me because yeah I there's a little bit in the in the article about just just how readily the aspects of southern culture just move right into the western so you've always got southerners yes either just because they inform the western hero you know kind of gentleman man of honor ethos but the literal will be a sonner yeah also just the rebel the the you know the individual protagonist is always going to be because like even in those movies and a lot of other ones really until glory and asense the union is kind of like big government you know what I mean it's it's big it's kind of it's slow it's dumb it's it's kind of scary it can overwhelm you you know in the end it wins but it's not likable at all it's just as a character it's always it's almost just reminds me of how you know the rebel type would see the government machine oh yeah they had such an easy way of characterizing yes exactly that that you know that military force is just like you can't that's what buster Keaton means I'm sure how do you make heroes right of those people it's that's why sheings chanandoah it has this very really gentle decent union officer trying to do the right thing played by George Kennedy which usually played the villain or the big comical out and I literally just froze I couldn't believe what I was seeing because you just get so used to seeing if it's a Yankee uniform you're just looking at some reprimate or worthless member faceless member of a of an invading hoard you just never see this so it was quite a shocking moment but John I have to just because you used to make everybody watch Gettysburg yes so I think at this point you do have to you do and it's got all the battles that's all that yeah well as you both know I watched some parts of Gettysburg many hundreds of times but it's hard to bear in some parts basically it's hard to bear until the battles start and to its credit it does have a lot of battles yes although they're they're a bit cheesy but a lot of I don't know a battle fans can handle a lot of cheese which is why they don't look good in those uniforms and they're the scene on little round top which any civil war fan has been reading about since they were about seven years old is cheesy but good partly because of the fact that Jeff Daniels moustache is a character in its own right yeah I was gonna say that was pretty much accident off the stage yeah I couldn't get over it was like it was like a junior high school production when it came to the beards and the moustaches and stuff like guys you know it's like they ran out of money when it came to the they went to the local 7-11 it got a beard yeah one of the most striking things about it is is that as you quote Portis in one of your reviews Eileen we are less than our fathers we don't even look like them we very much don't look like them yes for one thing we're much heavier most of us and it and also we're a lot older when we actually accomplished something most of the civil war generals were very young you kind of had to be it was a pretty strenuous job at anything below core commander you you had to get out there though I've just been reading yesterday about a Confederate general who was very ineffective can't remember his name at the moment but everyone blamed it on its age which was mid fifties and that was considered far too old to be a general a field commander so they all look too fleshy they all look too old um and they they do talk in Gettysburg a bit like civil war era upper echelon people talk that is they speak in full sentences without coming off like Martin from the Simpsons yeah but I think that's hard for our culture to do so it doesn't always work very well right um well what are the components of a good civil war battle scene they have to ideally look like they could be civil war people but what like are their components you can say this is what makes it good or just accuracy or something like that uh yeah um i think i'm indefineable ex-factor it's oddly similar in my memory to while kyle why kyle mclochland was perfect for blue velvet but god awful as palmoa d because yeah he was he was such a namby pamby suburb boy perfect for blue velvet not at all right for the yeah only son of an aristocratic house of the old school that because they killed there's a line in the tempest that is often misunderstood where uh aerial says to her father be something like be careful he for he is gentle and quick to anger which seems paradoxical in contemporary terms but isn't it all gentle means of good birth and therefore he'll kill you in a second and you need to find someone who can play moa deep who's both you know a very snotty and aristocratic and a killer and you need something rather similar for uh any civil war officer and it ain't Timothy's shti shale or whatever his name is shale me yeah and it ain't kyle mclochland either yeah one one thing i'll say about birth of a nation is the the young men look pretty authentic i mean they like don't you think i lean out of they have kind of ghostly older than their age chisel to fit in these fancy clothes uh kind of just yeah i think you can still find it easier back in the 1910 yeah exactly the way people that look like that and and they were able to have it's a dwe grv that was able to film like columns of these people marching and you didn't have to as john said you know pan away quickly because they all look like they just got back for chipotle or something like that um yeah they really did look the part but i guess i lean um if you could name i don't know uh three or five civil war films i mean you know i i i haven't done the numbers or anything but i might gather that roughly half of our audience is not american um and um so i don't know which ones would you would you recommend oh it's a tough one um just because there's so few that are really good but i you know i'll tell you what ones i i like i like the general we were talking about this before the show started with just fostering kittens yes masterpiece is considered and he plays it surprisingly good yeah it's excellent it's and it holds up the way most silent films it yeah it does i mean i have to admit i don't get trolley chaplain i'm willing to admit i'm probably missing something and yet i do get buster ketan's kittens stays much more more contemporary he really does yeah yeah i mean he doesn't he doesn't have the same you know chaplain wanted to stay invested in a melodramatic world that was pretty much dead by the time he was he was making films um but you know yeah yeah not ketan he's resolutely modern and even contemporary um but it's you know it's it's because he's into things that are so fast he's he's basically trying to recover his train which is pistol he's an engineer yes and you just get into the just the marvelous logistics of weight and mass and it's just gags built on endlessly trying to maneuver by himself run a train get his train back come back at the exact same route on the same tracks with all now but now you've got to prevent them from catching you in another train and it's just because of the ruthless logic the comedic unfolding yeah that it remains intensely fascinating and actually quite funny but it's also just got it's just beautifully atmospheric uh yes really quite watch it on big tv which i have you know normally you just watch on a little screen but on a big tv you see it's it's pretty cool i mean the you know the technology is already a lot better in 1925 than 1915 definitely and yeah and ketan looks wonderful in period costume and he would spare no expense you know his profits were never what they should have been because he just would spend so much money to get just right he literally destroyed this vintage train there's a scene where a stupid general has to order a train to cross to cross a bridge over a chasm claiming that which is on fire that bridges on fire claiming it will hold and then you get this wonderful jaw sagging moment when of course the whole train slowly collapse and falls into the chasm and and and and ketan of course you know did that whole thing got it founded refurbished it and destroyed it and i can see why he why chose to be on the Confederates like is the Confederates all have are inherently funnier than the union i mean i just i think there's so much more comic setup like you know the including like the girlfriend who's like you know you didn't enlist you know he's up against southern ideology he does a wonderful short film if you've never seen it it's very it's it's more it's it's more anti-bellum but it's it's another confrontation of his he's trying to marry a southern girl and the the her father and brothers hate him and he's an interloping northerner and so they keep trying to wail him out of the house to kill him but because southern hospitality dictates that as long as he's in the house they kill him because he's a guest so it's just all these one you know frantic runs and you know leaping into windows get back in the house so they can't kill him so anyway our hospitality also excellent but um i love a movie called the tall the tall target it's about Lincoln trying it's a little it's kind of pre-war but it's just infused with arguments and passionate takes on slavery and the union and you know they can better see it's about the uh they attempted assassination of Lincoln when he was trying to go through Baltimore for the inauguration which was as far as i know quite a real plot yes it was a real plot apparently and yeah he had to as he said i never something he has a beautiful line but it's something about having to sneak in to his own inauguration like a thief in the night right no president had ever had to do that and it's just again it's it's it's it's one of the few very pro-northern films of that era it's on 1951 film it's done in beautiful black and white and it's just all about this attempt to on the part of a police detective who's kind of gone rogue to try to prevent what he's heard is going to be this assassination attempt and it's all on this train but you've got the you know the kind of microcosm of America people are you in their positions sounds dull but it actually works wonderfully so that's a great film by Anthony Mann who's a great filmmaker to a lot of film noir um and a lot of westerns and then combine the westerns and film noir together in in great configuration so he's quite good um i'm trying to think what else obviously glory everyone's got to see glory you know i i will say it's it's it's it's become a thing not to say now and usually i don't like Spielberg but there are sections of Spielberg's uh Lincoln that i actually quite like even though it's got unfortunate Spielberg-y stuff all over it but what i like about it is it has the sections where it's focusing on the job at hand which is how can Lincoln get the 13th amendment passed when he doesn't have the votes and it actually gets into kind of comical sequences and James Spader is strangely good as this kind of fat political hustler i remember he looked dirty yeah he looked dirty and he's very good and he's very good and he's very good and he's very good and he's very good he's good and and they've just got to you know it doesn't matter whether they offer them anything i think they've got to turn four votes or something to get it passed and just the intricacies of that i really i really like because that seemed and that was an unusual take it wasn't the typical take it wasn't the typical angle i'm getting into the war so i i like sections of it but again sections of it are horribly Spielberg-y yeah but it was surprising i guess what was the big surprise at that time i remember people people being very excited about it was that it was pro north unabashedly pro north was just and there has been that cultural turn right just very recently recently it's like glory kind of came out of nowhere but it's not like it spawned a whole new look um but yeah it's just very very recently that all of a sudden they're all and it hasn't necessarily made all the movies better but at least it's made them ideologically better but yeah they're certainly easier to use your to watch yeah yeah exactly i mean because unfortunately i the one i was really hoping for was was the free state of jones yeah yeah and i just wound up not not liking that so much i don't think it was that bad but i guess i had no i went into it actually with very low expectations oh that's the best way yeah yeah i had very low expectations and um um thought it was thought it was all right do they make Corinth, Mississippi the most disgusting place to have a battle on the face of the earth because i don't recall so that probably says now yeah the reason the Confederate army left early was that they were they lost as many casualties to plain old swamp theaters as they had at the battle of of shylo a little while before and uh yes it also and they all had diarrhea to the point that they just they talked about the evacuation of Corinth in a very ironic way so my memory of it it was a long time ago is that to me it looked like a horrible place to hide out but that was sort of what protected them in a sense because who the hell who they want no one's gonna go but yes steeping slaves yeah and pop the movie didn't seem to um focus on like how physically horrible that environment was is that well i'm thinking about the town of Corinth the test swamp no i know from my lean's review that they airbrushed the swamp yes you got to do Corinth as uh an absolute yeah i mean it you know the plus side is it's such a great narrative that you can't entirely botch it's based on a true account over i named newton night yeah who basically declares you know his own his own state in mississippi that he then has to defend which is pro union you know anti slavery and everything else in missus is so that means he's living yeah you know basically sitting on you know his front step with a shotgun and his sons and the woods with guns and their determed to the teeth and they're having to fight off all comers until he for the rest of his life and he lives to be i don't know 88 or something just so amazing oh he's an amazing guy yeah amazing so you'll read the book for sure yeah the book is the book is not bad at all i i didn't see the movie but the book is really quite good and uh the the incident maybe the climax of night's career is when he kicks in the door of uh uh tavern in ellisville the local town and blasts this uh confederate major macklemore who's in charge of hunting down deserters uh uh very effective gorilla action and the strangest thing about that is i started looking into this i was researching it for a while that actually that incident became a song among anti confederate missus hippie folk music fans one of i can't remember the guy's name but one that has a song and major mage major macklemore's gone like that for the chorus like wow you know another thing that you you rarely see is it's it it really tries to tackle um um reconstruction yeah and how dire it is and how very quickly all all hopes and dreams of a more just inequitable um south uh just you know get stomped to death so so that's rare to see not in the terms gone with the windish terms or birth of an asterisk to usually see which is the Yankee carpet bagger who's repatious who's coming to make money off the ruins i know who arm in arm with a freed black slave who's always portrayed in the most you know insulting possible terms um so that was that's the way you'll see most of the time and this actually tries to counter that so that's so funny that yeah even missus hippie had its you know pro union breakaway or anti confederacy let's say breakaway regions like north carolina to but of course birth as you know the one state that didn't have any of that at all with south carolina which is the hero of birth of a nation or the setting for birth of nation right yeah i mean we just said net only confederacy that did not have uh unit fighting in the union army which is pretty striking well yeah i just want to mention one last movie that um i don't think a lot of people have seen it's called the great north field minnesota raid uh and it it includes an amazing cast it's it's also from that odd hippies doing civil war thing uh but uh robert duval as jesse james who's pure evil is uh very good and uh i think cliff robertson as coal younger what's it called again great north field minnesota raid very very strange but i remember it fall in early seventies okay and i i think this might have been on your list is it i mean no and i'm going to be back to my shame jones been telling me to watch this damn thing for decades and i still have a watch it but it would be a great companion piece with the baguil that would be close yes yeah right so um so okay you given a few movies i don't know if there's anything else i mean we've talked about you know oh maybe one last recommendation we know jonsense great north field minnesota raid okay yes there one last one um i don't even know off mine i think i might have said all mine there's still civil war movies yet to be made is what it says to me yeah yeah absolutely that's like a lot of them that's what's frustrating about the overall experiences i'm always reading oh my god they're gonna do harry a tub and oh my god oh my god and getting really excited and then getting disappointed so you know the movies in my head are certainly not appearing anywhere on screen that's do you think the part of the problem again is just it's expensive to do the big war scenes or do you think they still have the same worries about you know constituencies or or is just well as we can say it seems like that's kind of loosening up and it was yes you know i just think the the the war scenes would be so fabulous that it's just like why if they're gonna throw so much money it's so much crap i mean i just saw avatar and i wanted to put gun away it's bad huh oh i just hate it um but yeah i i don't know why there couldn't be a big epic on an anniversary year civil war movie that can finally be pro north and anti-slavery and do the battles and pick which battles do sherman do grant yeah yeah and really yeah that would be so fantastic it's just a bafflement to me that it hasn't happened saving private and then somebody from the north i think you know why not it should be done i mean we're a weird country aren't we because like i know there's no american revolution movies apparently there's that bad uh yeah that's the worst the worst movie ever i that's a good case for not making any way exactly if they're gonna do that they shouldn't so there's just that's so weird i was rooting for the brits in that one if i remember i would go that far but yeah i know what you mean i think i see i only time i have that yeah i was genuinely rooting for the brits as well yeah and but that our civil war movies are so odd they're so odd and skewed not just ideologically but toward like home front stories and not and not famous famous battles i know and and we and not the famous you know biographies you think and we just it's just such an odd history that you think i think they were compared to getty's but it gets a nice getty's berg but like there's so many other battles too i just the whole western campaign and yeah ddash me day i mean exactly it's just it's just all that material just sitting there so all right well we all agree on that yeah um anyway we've kept you very long as john said and and we want to thank you again so much ilin jones check out her podcast and um and newsletters well patreon film suck will post links to film suck of course that film suck one word film suck one word and read her excellent reviews they're always fun to read on almost always on jackubin if not always and ilin is the only um reviewer period i can think of let alone film reviewer or whatever that can write about something that she likes which is i tell you is a writer it's very hard to write about something you like unless unless you focus on everything everyone around what you like that you hate that's what i do is like okay i like this thing i'm gonna write about everybody who rips so and so off and who's bad because i can't really write about what i like but you you have that that talent to even be able to write about what you like like the comb brothers or whatever you know and make it fun and compelling to read um so every every one of your reviews is great so oh thank you guys god this has been delightful i wish i wish i could use every day yeah all right thanks again next time another suburb movie comes out we'll yes get your ball let's do this all right you hear in that hollywood yep okay all right get up thanks
