    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. Today today is October 25th, 2022. And this is episode 352, the Cosmarch Games, up here in Western New York. And I'm online with Gary Breacher, aka John Dillon, aka The Warner in Triesta, John Haydon. Good. Good. And let's get colder in Triesta so that the Zanzari or mosquitoes die off soon. But otherwise it's great here. I love Triesta. It's best to tell in the city. It's like three episodes in a row that you've loved in a city. It's getting into record, that's great. So it must be really good. I'm looking forward to hopefully one of these days. I'll be right along the sea. You can walk along the sea. It's beautiful. Yeah. For some reason in my head, and it's probably wrong, but I have this idea that there's something almost kind of norcally about it. I don't know. Is that at all right? Or not? That's true. That's true. Yeah, oh, the old thing. Yeah, yeah. Well, there's a lot of chaperale around here. Only it's limestone, rock, barely any soil, which is why it's probably still wilderness. And yeah, in that way, it's like Portugal, like I presume Spain, although I don't know anything about Spain, it's got a good old California feel to it. I mean, I mean, you know, great weather and not too hot, at least since you've been there. I mean, California used to have a norcal anyway. It used to have pretty damn good weather, whatever else you'd say about it. Yeah, I remember my experience of watching that movie, there will be blood, which was a big noise at the time. I don't know where they filmed it, but there was just some accidental shot. And I just saw the California of my childhood when we still had quail and snakes in the neighborhood. And it almost broke my heart. The rest of the movie didn't make that much of an impression on me, but that was really milkshakes. Isn't he scream about milkshakes? I remember that. Yeah, it's about slant drilling or something. Okay. Hit him with the kingpin already or whatever. By the way, speaking of movies, and then we'll get to this is going to be a great episode returning to the Civil War series, the Warner Civil War series. But real quickly, have you ever seen, I just saw Exorcist 3 last night. It was available on one of those streaming things. And I never imagined I'd want to watch it, except that it has George C. Scott who's one of the great sort of 70s, 80s, 70s B movie actors, I mean, especially when he screams. But you know, Exorcist 1 was, if you were saw it as a little kid, which I unfortunately did, it was, it was an MK Ultra Siyop. I mean, it fucked me up really badly. Exorcist 2 was crap, and I don't think anybody's ever even finished it. And I saw someone say, no, Exorcist 3. And it does actually have some good moments in it, surprisingly enough. It's nothing like the original, but Brad Dorif is in it. What the hell? He's an outrage. What happened to him? He's so good though. He's like, you could give him the shittiest role and the shittiest lines. And he would do something amazing with it. He's great. He's really good. It's worth it just to see it for Brad Dorif. Well, he made a movie that no one's ever heard of, but I guess I should take the chance to recommend it. It was by John Houston, and it's a movie of Flanery O'Connor's wise blood. And he plays Hazel Motes. It's kind of an amazing movie, only it's like the novel. It's very frightening, very creepy. There's some Neo Catholic who's trying to reconcile Catholicism hopelessly with 21st century and YT norms who said, I certainly wouldn't want to meet Flanery O'Connor's God. No, no, you wouldn't. But I don't think that proves that O'Connor was wrong about doctrine. Right. So that was our little foray into Halloween, you know, scare movies. Anyway, let's get to the real stuff, the real meat and potatoes. So to speak here, back to the Civil War. So this is going to be the 12th in the Warner Civil War series. The first one started way back, episode 295. That was part one when you introduced Count Adam Gerowski. Whose name is popped up a lot in this war. And one of the running themes, well, I think basically a running name is everything you know about the Civil War is wrong, listen to this. But one of the really great discoveries I think you made which clarified something that's been nagging anybody who's ever been interested in this war is the degree to which McClellan was not a failure or timid or all these other things that were sort of that were used to describe him, but a trader to one degree or another conscious trader. And so that that theme is also sort of ran throughout and helped explain. I mean, not just McClellan, but a huge parts of the whole Northern elite. I mean, a president you can in, for example, right? Yeah, people who want to remind themselves about this can go to Radio Warner episode 303, where we talk in detail about that and about what it meant to be part of McClellan's click and the whole West Point click. And yeah, we'll meet some of the more unsavory extras in that click in this episode. Like Samuel Sturgis who is famous and people think this is so cute for saying, I don't give a pinch of owl done for John Pope. And then this was to justify his getting in the way of a supply train on the eve as they say of a major battle. And it's like, oh, what a card. Well, card trader, you know, a lot overlap there. Yeah, so why don't you introduce today's episode, I mean, the main character or sort of the central character here is going to be Pope, right? And John Pope, John Pope. Pope is almost universally despised by civil war historians who are a very consensus oriented, a lot of people. I mean, most, most groups in the US are very collegial, very, group oriented by this time. And there is very much a consensus that Pope was a boastful fool. And worst of all, he basically, it's a big crime to get rid of a made man. And he got rid of a made man who was Fitz John Porter, McClellan's closest crony. And I would say co-conspirator. At the end of all this that we're going to talk about today, the Battle of the Campaign really of Second Manassus, Fitz John Porter was court martialed and convicted of refusing to obey a direct order to attack and refusing at Second Manassus and refusing to send his court to the sound of the gun. Because he tried to argue that he hadn't gotten any official order. That was a lie. But the Second Stage argument went, you didn't have to have a direct order. You kept fresh troops away from their comrades who were clearly under attack to the point that they brought in testimony from hundreds of soldiers that, oh, yeah, we could hear the firing all the time. We thought we were going to go in, but no, we stacked the arms, didn't move. And I'll talk about why that was. But what really happened is Fitz John Porter, McClellan's crony was convicted. He was out of the army for the duration of the war and thank God for that. But he was rehabilitated, very much rehabilitated in a Soviet way. In a decade after the war ended, that did not mean really that he was exonerated just that time to change and not for the better. I'll talk about that in detail later. But let's just go back to Second Manassus, the campaign, the battle. It's not as well known as First Run, by First Bull Run Manassus. And by the way, Bull Run is the name of a creek. Manassus is the name of a town near that creek, southeast of Washington, DC. Right, because I think a lot of people know as the battle Bull Run. Right. So Second Battle Manassus is the same thing as Second Battle Bull Run. Absolutely the same. These are naming conventions. The North preferred to name things after rivers, creeks, bodies of water. So it would be Second Bull Run for the North. Manassus is a town. The South preferred to name battles after town. It's kind of interesting that the first one is named Bull Run and popular imagination. The second one is more often called Second Manassus. Almost Southern Gloting, I suspect. So anyway, people know the first Bull Run more or less like, yeah, there was battle near Washington. Everybody came out to watch and then I saw the big ski daddle. Not that many people know anything really about the Second Battle of Manassus. And to the extent that they do, they know that there was some scandal there. And that scandal was basically a McClellan Crony Fitz-John Porter being tried for what amounted to treason. Because a lot of people hearing the notes of that case said Porter should have been shot if it was true. And eventually they persuaded themselves in a very typical way that it couldn't be true because that was unacceptable. We've talked before about this habit of thinking about the Civil Wars. Well, of course I weren't traders. It might look that way, but no, no. Well, it's worth a reconsideration. It speaks poorly of, I mean, I don't know, if you want people to deify this country and its history, you just can't have that many traders so high up. It just suggests something else about the American character than the one that they want to project. Yeah, that's true. It's the rest of us. Yeah, there's an elite. In this case, it's pretty easy to identify because most of them are West Point grads. As was Pope for that matter, but Pope went, what's the phrase people use, went rogue or something. And he was much, much hated. In fact, Lincoln's verdict on Pope, which actually made a lot more sense than most views of Pope was that Pope did right, but he was hated by the generals. And we had to take him out of there because it just got to be too much. Now this, okay, so let me introduce the battle a bit in context. First of all, this is August, it's a three day battle August 28th, 30th, 1862. It's the same sort of suburban, you know, now this place, I imagine, is part of the McMansion belt built by the Iraq and Afghanistan wars in the suburbs of DC. But at the time, it's just a small town, the same place where obviously first bull run had been fought. And it's the summer of 1862. So what does that mean? People have this idea that the South did really, really well in the first couple of years of the war. That's only true when you're talking about Maclellan. Everywhere else, you go, not so good. In the West for starters, people often have a vague sense in the West, people did, the Union did pretty well. They did more than pretty well. They basically came close to eliminating the Confederate presence in Kentucky and Tennessee. And there were battles, even where they lost like Wilson's Creek, they forced to retreat. But they also had success in the East along the coast. They took coastal North Carolina out of the war early. They drove the Confederates out of Missouri, but in Virginia, balls, bluffs, they had a bad time because a certain guy named George McClellan was in charge. Another victory is millsprings, Ford Henry, Ford Donaldson, massive campaigns by Grant, totally decisive victory. And P. Ridge in Arkansas, Silo eventually added up to a Union victory that was in Tennessee also. The capture of Corinth, then we get to the big disasters, which all involve McClellan. The seven days battles up to the gates of Richmond, really, where he sort of couldn't help almost getting to Richmond. And then there was a series of battles starting with seven pines where he was attacked, he fell back. But the most important thing that happened was Joe Johnston, commander of the Confederate Army in Virginia at that time, got shot. And whoever shot him, Stalin, who had a cold review of things, would probably have said, you shot Joseph Johnston, that was the worst thing you could have done for us. And with lethal results. But I don't know who shot Johnston, but it led to Lee taking command of the Army of Northern Virginia. And Johnston was a very cautious commander, not as cautious as McClellan, because you couldn't be without being institutionalized. But close, Lee knew McClellan. And he knew McClellan could, as Grant said about Gideon Pillow at Ford Donaldson, he knew that any position held by that guy, he could walk up to it and do handstands. And nothing would happen. So Lee knew he had the number. Lee's name has come up a lot in your excellent Warner Civil War series. And well, I don't know, maybe this is for a different show, I'm sure, maybe a show about generals. But your assessment of Lee is, you don't trash him or put him down too much, but you don't exalt him the way all American war buffs are supposed to. Exalt him is one of the greatest generals, you know, that this country is ever produced. But you also, you do have respect for him to some to agree for his commanding and technical abilities and so on. But I don't know, where would you put him, just without getting too deeply into this. But would you assess him compared to the consensus? I'd say he was very good at defending Northern Virginia against a series of incompetent generals because he knew the ground really well and he got to know it better and better as the war went on. And it was a really small area, basically the suburbs or the proto-suppers between Washington, DC and Richmond. His troops knew that territory in the dark. Whenever Lee ventured out of his comfort zone and his comfort zone was that patch of territory, things did not go well. Whenever he tried an invasion of the North at Antietam or at Gettysburg, he was a disaster. He was a disaster in West Virginia where he served also against McClellan and more importantly against Rosecrans who saved McClellan's bacon, but that's another story, Battle of Rich Mountain. Lee was a disaster there. That's where he had got the nickname Granny Lee because before they decided to worship his decorum and his reserved well-dressed manner, they called him a sissy for that same manner because he lost a lot of times when he was recalled. I would say Lee was good at fighting in the Confederate manner. It was imposed on him basically because he was outnumbered most of the time. The Confederate manner, which was tactically defensive, strategically offensive, that is make the bigger army attack you and then lead them. And because you know that as Pope said about his orders from DC in this battle, we're going to talk about it was like fighting with one leg chained to a post while the opponent was allowed to circle around you as much as you wanted. Lee could also do that because Jefferson Davis was a bit more hands-off than the collection of freaks in DC and God-what incompetent freaks they were like Halleck. Halleck above all was he did not deserve to have a character named after him in Dune. That's all I'll say. He was famous for his advanced decorum of Mississippi with an army of a hundred thousand which as everyone involved in that campaign said could have marched directly to the Gulf of Mexico through Georgia wherever it wanted to go. He advanced at a pace of one to two miles a day and then insisted on digging in. And that was because Grant hadn't dug in at Shiloh and it's like okay like Grant got a splinter in his finger and now you're going to cut off your hand in order to make sure that doesn't happen again. I mean there was absolutely no reason to be that insanely cautious but Halleck like McClellan had a kind of military book learning, not a really advanced book learning. It's a thing that Guraski called strategy and he called it that in the most pejorative sense because Guraski had experienced real war in Europe and every time he heard someone talk about strategy he wanted to pull what was left of his hair out because as he said what strategy you are you Hicks are talking nonsense. You go to Virginia, you hang the leaders that's it. You kill everybody who causes your trouble. But for example strategy meant that in this campaign McClellan who was totally panicked by this time he was shell shocked he couldn't do anything. At one point in this campaign when McClellan is at Harrison's landing on the James River writing letters to Lincoln saying don't you dare do the emancipation proclamation and by the way I have a quarter million confederates against me when there were in fact like you know 60,000 maybe. He can go to Richmond by sailing upriver and then directly west inland while Lee is feeling his way north to trap Pope's smaller force and Pope telegraphs him and tells him that and McClellan writes back a chilly strategy informed response saying no I fear another Australits at Australits as you will recall Napoleon managed to withdraw and draw the enemy into a foolish advance and I don't want that to happen to me and this is the kind of thing that makes it surprising the Pope remained such a polite man in his old age because the temptation to do the union in favor and shoot McClellan must have been immense. But Lee at least didn't seem to have I mean he was he loved his uniforms and his you know gloves and his neatly trimmed beard and all that but he didn't seem to have the same you know strategy obsession as far as I can tell he. Oh no no no he knew what he was doing in fighting people like McClellan. Right. If a better commander I mean troops said this and when Grant took over the army of the Potomac in 1864 I think was it three or four I think four. They loved McClellan a lot of them. In the same way that confederate troops often loved Joe Johnston. He's the kind of commander who who had a rep for caring for the troops and above all caring for them by not sending them into combat much. They actually liked that kind of commander like that's our guy. But they didn't give him credit for any military knowledge and one author who's writing who's talking to these troops and writing memoir about it said what do you think would happen in these two situations. Grant gets command of the army of the Potomac in 1861 or McClellan takes command of the army in 1864 and they all sort of laughed and said well if granted had command of this army as it was then before we all got killed he would have been enrichment in a week and then okay so what about if McClellan got it in 1864 oh he would have ended the war in favor of the confederate. He would have marched right on DC. You know I think that's a real possibility by the way. That's something that occurs to me a lot lately after reading miles of this stuff that McClellan was very close to toying with the idea of a military dictatorship to impose emancipation in 1862 and that was after a series of disasters. If he had ever God knows how, won a real victory it is very possible. He and his click would have marched into Washington and established a dictatorship. Luckily they were too stupid to do that. Yeah so let's get back to I'm sorry I kind of knocked you off course there a little bit by a little detour and had leans of the other generals let's get back to second battle of Manassas. Why don't you give this sort of I don't know the big picture stuff and then we'll get into the actual battle. Right okay I thought the best way to give the standard view the consensus view is to quote the wiki on the battle and then we'll get into other versions. Here's the wiki which is by the way on the whole thing which I don't have time to read is unusually hostile to Pope that you get that a lot. Pope is like the whipping boy for a lot of things. Anyway here's what they say Lee sensing that Pope was indecisive split his smaller 55,000 man army sending Stonewall Jackson with 24,000 men as a diversion to Cedar Mountain where Jackson defeated Pope subordinate Nathaniel Banks we'll talk about banks later. As Lee advanced on Pope with the remainder of his army, Jackson swung around to the north and captured Pope's main supply base at Manassas station confused and unable to locate the main Confederate force. Pope walked into a trap at the second battle of Bull Run. His men with stood a combined attack by Jackson and Lee on August 29th, 1862 but on the following day reluctantly obeying Pope's orders, Major General Fitz John Porter swung to attack Jackson exposing his and by extension the whole Union army's flank. Major General James Long Street launched a surprise flanking attack and the Union army was soundly defeated and forced to retreat. Pope compounded his unpopularity with the army by blaming his defeat on disobedience by Major General Porter who was found guilty by court martial and disgraced and then as we said rehabilitated a decade after the war. My take on the battle is that basically Pope was not indecisive at all. He had an amazing record of decisive aggressive action in the West. He was not indecisive, he was betrayed by incompetence and outright hatred by most of his subordinates, especially Porter. And in short that Porter was guilty along with McClellan and some others, Major Key, the two brothers, the key brothers. But as we said, there's this American version of good manners, especially to made men, like Lincoln worrying endlessly about whether he'd hurt McClellan's feelings by removing him less than whether it hurt having your leg blown off and getting shot in the jaw in the idiotic battles that McClellan insisted on losing. So you see, I'm sorry, once again we see indecisive standing in for something else like treason. This time not Pope's treason, but somebody else betraying him. But it's always like saying the US blundered into the Iraq war or something like no, there were actual assholes. We can make mistakes. We can't be indecisive. It's a weakness of character rather than something darker and uglier, which is betrayals, really low characteristics. They don't really want that into the record much. Nope. The results of the battle are clear. It was a disaster for the union. 14,000 of their soldiers died. The Confederate casualties are lower. It's not clear how much lower because you can't trust Confederate stats. They barely kept them at all. But roughly 8,000 casualties in the battle. But more importantly, the army Lincoln and Alec invented for Pope, brought him east and shunted various units into this new army, the army of Virginia. It was destroyed. Pope was exiled to Minnesota, effectively banished from the big war. On the other hand, good results. Fitzgahn Porter for refusing to attack when ordered by Pope was court-martialed and convicted, then pardoned, of course, wrongly pardoned, as I see it. Pope maybe was not tactful. He was eloquent, by the way, he was a really good writer. But he came in much like Grant did later from the Western theater with a Western theater attitude. But this was early in the war. The West Point clicks still had a powerful hold on the army of the Potomac and associated armies. And they were deeply offended that he would be brought in at all because it was like an indictment of their leaders. Like how dare you say, we're in common? Well, you were in common. Here's a quote from a lieutenant commander of the US Navy who wrote as part of his graduate program, a 2002 book called John Pope failure at second battle of Bull Run. And here's again the consensus view. Quote, Pope's paranoia regarding commanders who have come from McClellan's army of the Potomac resulted in a lack of trust. This lack of trust resulted in his disregarding intelligence. Conclusion, the fog of war has clouded the judgment of many generals. And Pope was no exception. I feel like sort of wiped my hands like, well, that settles that. But this is a commander, a guy who plays the role of least commanding something today. Yeah, it's probably very collegial. It's a collegial verdict. There are newer, better books that have the courage to look at things differently. The best of those is probably John Mutsui's book, The First Republican Army, the Army of Virginia and the radicalization of the Civil War. That's 2017. And Mutsui goes back and reads the sources and says, maybe they got rid of Pope, but they were already sick of the hands off, a nicely, nicely approach to the Confederate civilian population, which was feeding the Confederate army while pretending to be neutral or pro union. And Pope's arrival and Pope's attitude radicalized them for the remainder of the war. We've seen this before, by the way. Yeah, I was going to say in the West, right? And we've seen the citizens soldier, yeah, babies, memoir where he goes crazy in his journal about Don Carlos's, Carlos Buell's attitude. And then he finally gets his own troop train shot up and stops the train, marches everybody out and burns the town. Another contribution that really helped me is an addition of the military memoirs of General John Pope, which was issued by the Civil War America series and edited by Peter Cossens, C-O-Z-Z-E-N-S. Cossens, let's Pope tell his version and Pope is a remarkably good writer, by the way. The reason Pope was brought east, as I said, is that he'd done well on the Mississippi. He took island number 10, which after Vicksburg was the most important Confederate base on the Mississippi. An island, obviously, very difficult to take. He pioneered amphibious operations on the Mississippi, the same kind that we used by Granite Vicksburg. Not the Grand Gave credit to Pope. Grant is a very careful man, which was good, but not always kindly. Grant has his friends, and everybody else who's not one of his friends is a straw dog destined for sacrifice. Well, I think it's a George Thomas here too, really. So Grant gives Pope no credit for that, in spite of the fact that he developed this new way of war. And for that accomplishment, and for his work in Missouri early in the war, which was a sharp counter example to the deithering in the east, he was brought in. He knew this would not work, because what he'd done in the west was develop this army from scratch, good officers, well-trained troops, and above all, troops that were convinced that he meant what he said and knew what he was doing. Troops were in it entirely, and a lot of Republicans in his troops, which meant in those terms anti-slavery people. He knew that one more ideologically driven than yeah. As Matsui says, he had that effect. And he didn't want to go. He knew he was being set up, but they insisted on sending him. He offered to resign as resignation was refused. Wow. He really didn't want to go. He knew. He knew. He knew. He knew. It worked. I mean, a big frat. You know, you go against the frat. Not that I was exactly a frat. Oh, I was rushed by the Delta Sigma. I just, you know, I didn't think it was cool. Yeah. Why don't you sit over here, John? Mohammed, what's that scene in my ass? There's only, they would have sat me down when, because I wasn't even bathing every time. Anyway, but so they sent him hoping that his presence alone would be a sort of talisman effect a huge change. It doesn't work that way. You got to you got to change the whole set. If they brought his army east, that would have worked. But he had two problems in the east. His subordinates and the government in Washington, DC, which was only a few miles away. And Pope dealt with this in a way that has never been forgiven. I mean, now 2022 by the US military. Wikipedia entry people. Yeah, I mean, Jesus. He said, and I swear to God, he's hated to this day for this. Quote, I have come to you from the west where we have always seen the backs of our enemies. I'd like you guys. I have been that wasn't a real that part wasn't real. But the rest of this is, I have been sent here to lead you against the enemy. I desire you to dismiss from your mind certain phrases, like taking strong positions, lines of retreat, bases of supplies. Let us discard such ideas. The strongest position a soldier should desire to occupy is one from which he can most easily advance against the enemy. Let us study the probable lines of retreat of our opponents and leave our own to take care of themselves. The funny thing about this is, it's a lot like what Grant said when he came east. There's a famous quote from Grant, but it's always quoted approvingly in Grant's case. And I'll quote that now. Oh, I am hardly tired of hearing about what Lee is going to do. Some of you always seem to think he is suddenly going to turn a double, double summer salt and land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time. Go back to your command and try to think what we are going to do ourselves instead of what Lee is going to do. And that was Grant's genius, even though it's pretty much what Pope said three years earlier. But Grant's is more earthy, kind of like earthy defiant, plain American talk. Pope's is a little bit more brash. And a little more grandiose. A little more grandiose. And also like I could see McClellan yelling out too soon, too. You said that a little in 1862. Maybe it was anyone to hear that yet. By 1864, they were ready to hear that more. Exactly. Yeah. Grant took over in May 1864. It was pretty obvious. For one thing, a lot of McClellan's cronies were gone. Above all, McClellan hits John Porter was going thanks to Pope, which was Pope's unquestionable contribution to the war effort. Right. Lincoln said at the time, Pope did well, but there was an army prejudice against him. All of our present difficulties have been brought upon us by these quarrels of the generals. And this raises an interesting question. There was certainly a lot of institutional backbiting going on. But it sort of sheds into the bigger kind of treason, like the fact that McClellan and Fitz-John Porter's best pals at West Point were all fighting for the Confederacy at this point. And McClellan and Porter were violently anti-emancipation. And they were willing to intrigue nonstop to do that. I thought I'd quote a letter from Fitz-John Porter written one month after he refused to attack one order in this battle. Just to show you the tone of Porter's letters, he talks weirdly like a Shakespeare villain. I swear to God. It's not that, oh, they talk that way in those days. No, they didn't. Just him. And this is to a right-wing editor, pal of his, in New York. And he's very polite. I'll just skip to the main point. I have an expecting daily to hear that your newspaper has been upset and no longer permitted to reflect the light of the sun and enlighten the darkened masses of abolitionists, secessionists, and other enemies. That is, he quates absente. Yeah, both sides of our radical kind. The people who fired on Fort Sumter are the same as the people who want to. And that sun metaphor is like, Iago, Goddamn. And above all, he speaks in the voice of McClellan. You know, as Tolkien had the voice of Sauron, the mouth of Sauron, and he's the mouth of McClellan, he says to this editor, you have no doubt been much gratified at our successes, and the rise once more of General McClellan. He appreciates the services of your newspaper. And the kind sympathy it has extended to him in times of darkness. You have no doubt also been anxious for a continued advance of the pursuit of the enemy. And as the radical say, smite him, it is easier said than done. I swear, God, that's close. This is a bad Star Wars talk. He should be in a big halitine robe. The rest of the letter is just praise for Lee. And this is a very common thing among McClellanites. Like he praises Lee's positions. They selected a beautiful position. And then he goes on, knowing we would not operate till the bridge was complete, he leisurely halted at Martin's Burgh, permitted all his trains to get behind him toward Winchester and has moved himself off. It's if he loves anybody besides McClellan, it's Lee. They barely had this. And yeah, as I said, I don't quite see it in terms of military capacity. There were brilliant Confederate generals, absolutely scarily brilliant. But Lee, I don't think so. Anyway, so that is how Fitzgroom Porter is talking to a friend in a private letter about the time of the battle. This is soon after the Battle of Entitum, the climactic battle, which McClellan really failed to win in spite of the fact that he had intercepted a letter with Lee's entire plan for the campaign. How you could lose after that? I don't know. But he didn't lose, but how he not won. And Mark, as we were talking about last time, his plan was to not win. Yes. Yeah, there's the spectrum of trees in here. I think this is an important thing to understand too. I mean, there is the movie villain actual working for the other side, you know, full on trees. But in the spectrum, there's also not winning and not following up. But intentionally, because you do not desire to win, you may not be directly working for the enemy and desiring their absolute victory. But you don't desire your side's victory and you make sure that your side isn't victorious. That's a reason too. I mean, obviously. Yeah. Yeah, especially when, as increasingly, I think, the goal here was to win sort of some sort of harmless victory against the Confederation and then go for dictatorship. And what this is all about is, of course, slavery. It always comes down to slavery. Later in this same letter, which is very long, if it were a Shakespeare soliloquy, it would be one of the ones that directors try to cut. So after Antietam Lincoln felt entitled to issue the preliminary emancipation proclamation. By the way, Lincoln had one of his best lines. He said, roughly, I'm going to wait till they have some kind of victory because otherwise it would be like the Pope's bull against the comet. Yeah. Ranting at the tide. So that was good enough for Lincoln. I issued this preliminary version of it. And Porter and McClellan were outraged. He said in this same letter, the proclamation was ridiculed in the army, caused disgust, discontent, and expressions of disloyalty, and amounting, I have heard, to insubordination. He says this was great approval. Those who have to fight the battles of the country are tired of the war and wish to see it ended and honorably by a restoration of the union. That is, the union as it was was slavery protected. So that's Porter, that's our guy. He did the same thing at Antietam less than a month after a second monasticity refused to attack. But he was working with McClellan in that battle. So he just whispered like the mouth of Saron and no, no, the Brad Duriff guy, Wormtongue, in Lord of the Rings. I control the last reserve of the last army in the union. Do you really want me to commit those troops? And McClellan was probably pissing his pants at that. No, no, no, that's all right. So these were the guys that Pope was working with. Another one was Samuel Sturgis, who's famous for that line about Aldon. And oh, isn't he cute? Sturgis was another West pointer. And he was actually, you know, if you've been through an American high school, Sturgis is familiar. He's a drunk, he's a failure, he graduated in the lower middle of his class at West Point. He's not very good at anything. And he's widely despised. Bullies lackey all the way. So he was trying to secure priority from General Herman Haupt for the movement of his troops. Told the other way to turn for troops going to support Pope as opposed to his purposes. And that's when he said, I don't care for John Pope, one pinch of Aldon. And for this, he's to this day celebrated as much as Pope is despised. It's kind of scary. I mean, sometimes going back through the actual civil war, you start to think, we're crazy. This place is crazy. So there were other generals who were probably more on the incompetent side like Franz Siegel. I mean, I was talking before about the incredible German contribution to the Union. So it's nice to be able to say Franz Siegel was a terrible general. He was like, maybe the only upper class Prussian who didn't have military ability in history. And he helped to he was one of the lieutenants and he helped to mess things up. As far as I know, he wasn't in on the the real West Point conspiracy. He was just an idiot. So the battle itself, since we need to get to that a little bit. Right. Yes. Yeah. Well, but set up the battle and why Pope did not want to fight in this way at all. What he wanted to do was what was working for the Confederacy in the East. Assume a defensive position up against the Blue Ridge mountains and make the Confederates come to him and then blow them away. This is really the best American battle strategy, battle tactics, let's say, in history from bunker hill to, I don't know what would be a good example to Chosen Reservoir perhaps like make them come to you and then blast them. It was working for Lee up to the point he decided to play around and attack the center of the Union. And he wanted to do that. He was overruled directly overruled from DC by Halleck and Lincoln who said, no, you can't do that. You have to interpose yourself on the plane, but is now suburb in front of Washington. So that enabled Jackson to take the dominant position because it that well cavalry, cavalry is another story. We'll just say quickly at this point in the war, Union cavalry in the East is generally very bad. And the cavalry that was supposed to support Pope was especially bad. General Hatch with direct orders to advance with a light cavalry force and occupy a key location, advanced with wagons while the roads were clocked with mud and got there several days late. This is the real time. Time is the real key to this battle and to understand what treachery meant. You can't see it from a stationary map. It depends on who did what when. And what happens here is everybody hates Pope. Everybody's deeply offended by the way he took command. And Mark, you described Obama doing something slow walking, right? Slow walking the indictments. Right. Well, it was Geithner. Is it slow walking? I can't remember. Maybe that was the term where Obama, for example, told Geithner his treasury secretary, we need, according to one book anyway, one by a really good journalist, Lowenstein or Brownstein, I can't remember his name. Anyway, after the banks collapsed and all that, Obama said we have to make an example of the worst bank and the worst bank with Citibank. And so what you need to do is basically get control of them, bankrupt them, break it up and take it over and then the other banks will just bail out. And Geithner is a Citibank guy. He was a Bob Ruben guy. Bob Ruben was the chairman, I think, of Citibank when it collapsed. And the whole Democratic Party was up to their eyeballs and that bank. So Geithner said, yeah, I sure boss, I'll get right on it. And then every couple of months or every couple of weeks, they'd ask what's going on. And he was a great, he was a great sleazy bureaucrat Geithner. He knew how to drag it out. He knew which subordinates to get rid of who might have been a little too active, how to put them out to pasture. And after a while, Obama just stopped asking about it. And that was it. Yeah. That's roughly how they dealt with Pope because time, and again, this raises the border between incompetence and or bad doctrine and treason. Because to some extent, I think people who'd been to West Point never understood, unlike every other commander in history, never understood that war is a matter of time. You got to do things immediately. Like, you have to reach this point now, now, someone said later in the war that no commander had an understanding of time like Grant did. But really, Grant's understanding of time was common sense, like Nathan Bedford Farthrow had no West Point education and was maybe the most brilliant, unfortunately commander in the Confederacy said, get there first with the most men. That was his whole strategy. That was West Point for him in one sentence, only better than West Point. Yeah. And Pope kept giving orders, you know, get there first with the most men and they kept slow walking it or whatever the term is. Yeah. MacClaude, for example, was perfect at designing battles like railroad bridges, which is what he'd been doing before. Like, you know, doesn't really matter how long you take, you just make the perfect thing. And you can't do that. That's why Lee was able to run rings around him. It was like Ali versus someone who'd, well, if Liston had had some of his own product before the fight, you know, he would just be swinging very slowly while Ali was going right around him. So that happens all through the battle. The cavalry doesn't move up. The infantry refuses to take or declines or isn't able to take the positions it's ordered to. And in the end, Pope ends up facing the Blue Ridge mountains on the plane and waiting for Jackson and lead to come down and fight him while Lee, while Longstreet, rather, with another confederate force is slowly moving up from the Southwest. Longstreet came in for a lot of criticism for being slow, which is really important. Confederate from confederate criticism, which really important because the maps don't show that what Pope wanted was to attack immediately before Longstreet could come up. You look at the map and if you see the standard maps of the battle, it will look like, hey, what about Longstreet in the Southwest moving northeast toward your position? You have to stop and deal with him. No, you attack first. That's what Lee would have done in this situation. You attack before he gets there and then you turn and face him. But this is where Porter, who was facing roughly Longstreet's advance, refused to attack on the last day of the battle, August 30th. This became a big controversy involving Pope, Porter, McClellan, and the whole, because McClellan also refused to help Pope. In the whole army, so to this effect, I want to quote some testimony from the trial of Fitz John Porter. I'm having a bit of trouble with the manuscript because there's only one available online version of the transcript. It's a speech by John Logan, a political general who wrote the great conspiracy about confederate domination of the government. I wrote a newsletter about that. This is someone who was dealing with a witness who was dealing with Fitz John Porter during the battle and the testimony is, I had been sent back to the ammunition on the train at Bristol and charged with its distribution. This is from an aid to camp. General Porter wished over 400,000 rounds. General Hooker, something over 90,000 rounds. At two or three o'clock, I had sent forward to General Porter some 320,000 rounds and it seized wagons to forward the ballots. The business being then sufficiently forward, I went on to find General Pope. On getting to the point where I had left him in the morning, I found he had moved on and to find out where he'd gone, I went to General Porter's headquarters near the Manassas water station. I found General Porter in his tent by some accounts reading a book in his tent for hours while the battle raged and asked him which road General Pope had taken and he informed me. I had some 10 minutes conversation with him. Will you state that conversation? After asking him about the road, I told General Porter the amount of ammunition I had sent forward to him and also the ballots would come immediately forward. I asked if he had received it or made some remark. General Porter said that he had not, that was the substance of his reply, either that he had received hardly any of it or none of it if I remember right. I expressed some surprise and said that it had been sent forward as ordered. He said that he had no officers to take care of it and distribute it or to look it up or something of that kind. Ironmark, he could hardly expect us at headquarters to distribute it in his corps that had been sent forward on the road where his corps was. He replied it was gone where it belonged that it was on the road to Alexandria wrong direction where we were all going. I do not know as it is evidence to give the spirit in what that is. I don't know if I should say the tone of voice the way it impressed me. The remarks were made in a sneering manner and appeared to me to express a great indifference. There was then a pause for a moment. General Porter then spoke in regard to removal of the second wounded from the field. He said it would hurt Pope leaving the wounded behind. I told him they were not to be left behind that I knew as a positive order had been given to banks to take all the wounded with him. To this, General Porter made no reply in words but his manner expressed to me the same feeling I had noticed before. That is, damn it, I wanted them left to make Pope look bad. This conversation from General Porter's manner and look made a strong impression on my mind. I left him as I have said after an interview of about 10 minutes and rode on. I went over to General Porter to him briefly what I had done. I then said to him, General, I saw General Porter on my way here. He said, well sir, I said, General, he will fail you. He said, what do you mean? What did he say? He said, it is not so much what he said though he said enough. He is going to fail you. These expressions I repeat, I think I remember them with exactness for I was excited at the time from the impression that they had been made upon me. He said, General Pope, how can he fail me? He must fight where I put him. One of those expressions. This, General Pope said with a great deal of feeling and impetuously, perhaps overbearingly, in an excited manner, I replied in the same way saying that I was certain that Fitzgian Porter was a traitor, that I would shoot him that night so far as any crime before God was concerned if the law would allow me to do it. I speak of this to show the conviction that I received from General Porter's manner and expressions in that interview. I can only add to my, that my prepositions, prepositions of him were favorable up to that time. I had never entertained any impressions against him until that conversation. Okay, now I'll skip a bit of the rest. Did he show any hostility to the commanding general? His attitudes seemed to me to rest on hostility. I do not know that I could analyze the impression that was made upon me. I conveyed it to General Pope in the words I've stated. I had one of those clear convictions that a man has a few times in his life, and so the character and purposes of a person he sees for the first time. This was clearly a great shock. Here's another bit of testimony from someone who was, I think, making a suit for Pope in New York City after the battle, and they're talking in what this tailor thinks it's a casual way about it. General Porter made the remark, I was not loyal to Pope. There is no denying that question. Do you recall anything else? Porter said in that connection. I cannot say that I do, and I doubt that I should recall it now, but for the peculiarity, and the fact that I made a record of it afterwards, this was during the progress of his trial before a court marshal. It was. Porter made quite an impression on a lot of people. Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's crazy. Yeah, he goes on. I have been a little bothered about General Fitzgahn Porter. I had to go to his room on Monday. One of the reporters of the New York Times was along with me while in the room after some conversation, General Porter made the remark, well, I wasn't loyal to Pope. Now, that is really the charge against him before the court marshal, that he did not do his duty as an officer before the enemy. This is almost like the aliens in Galaxy Quest, but that is not true. It's like the total shock, and that he did not act rightly toward General Pope as commanding officer. General Porter said what he said in the privacy of his own room without thinking of the fact of his words. After thinking it over, I concluded it better not to say anything about it now, though I would not promise much for that newspaper upon Carlisle and who heard it. This last testimony, because I think these are remarkable bits of evidence. As far as I know, they have never been read by people who simply accept the consensus, oh, Pope was a silly person, and Porter was loyal. And this guy interviewed Porter at his home in Washington, D.C. Do you recall any remarks made by General Porter? I do. One made a strong impression on me at the time. What was the remark which he made? I wasn't loyal to Pope. I was loyal to McClellan. That pretty much sums it up. As if they were enemies, which is exactly how McClellan's West Point click saw the matter. And the fact that Pope was considered more likely to bring on decisive battles, not only increase the elements of institutional dislike, but made it more difficult to fight for a draw, which meant that spectrum you talk about, Mark, every color in it is in play in this. Yeah. Yeah, I'm thinking again, I think it's hard for a lot of people to wrap their heads around the idea that generals, that senior commanders could be working at least as hard as not harder at undermining their internal rivals or the president, than they are against the enemy. And yet, just think of recent history. This is not, now these are not during, we're not talking nearly as sort of stressful a time, but like, you know, Stanley McChrystal, Trashing Obama. And that was Michael Hastings got that big scoop for Rolling Stone about, so here you had the top commander in Afghanistan just totally trashing his boss, like Michael Flynn, what a nutcase. Here was the head of the DIA under Obama. And this guy wants the Christophashist dictatorship. Like, it's these people, you've talked about this before, but generals are like, you know, child's, child Hollywood stars. I mean, they're insane. They have insane egos and they're insane people, a lot of them. Yeah, most of them. Yeah, most of them, not all, but a lot. Yeah, fighter pilots, quarterbacks, generals. Yeah, I just want to mention that Pope did some good things after the war as well, when things that turned against him, the reason really that Porter was rehabilitated a decade, and this is in spite of all those testimonies that John Logan brought in. He read them in Congress, but they made no difference because times had changed. It was, you know, the American people don't want to hear about that time. It was time for that stuff. Let's erase the blackboard here. But Pope did not change his convictions. This again is from the biography, biographical sketch in his military memoirs as a district commander in the deep south during reconstruction. Pope champion civil rights for blacks and won the grudging admiration of his former enemies to the point, by the way, that he was replaced in New Orleans for being too pro-freedman by a new style moderate in tune with the times. And then he, because he was posted to the far west as it was at the time, like Minnesota, from Pope came pleas for forbearance in dealing with the American Indian. Wisdom and humanity alike seemed to demand some policy which still saved the Indian from complete and violent extinction. He told Grant, you know, to no purpose. Of course, and he had a great line about McClellan, which sort of sums up the whole conspiracy, I would say. General McClellan was the most exquisite exponent of these Westpoint ideas. And he may be judged or with sufficient fairness for the present purpose from the estimate of himself which he gives in his late autobiography, which was quite a burn for anybody who'd seen Pope reveal, I've seen McClellan reveal himself as a strange, strange, horrible person, an egomaniac with a very fragile moment. I guess they all have fragile leaders, but always angry and afraid. Wounded. Yeah, at the same time that he was God's gift. Yeah, you're supposed to feign humility. I mean, if you're a smarter version of that, you feign humility. It's a basic strategy for the Anglo-World and probably other, isn't it? I mean, you know, if you're a high up general in your autobiography, well, I was just a simple fellow. I didn't know. You know, no, yeah, McClellan couldn't couldn't do that. No, wasn't in him. In fact, McClellan was famous and this astonished even people who wanted to be on his side. They kept saying, well, this autobiography came out 10 years after the war. We know how many troops Lee had. We know that Lee had no more than 70,000 troops. How come he didn't change his estimates? He keeps saying we had 200,000 troops. I mean, it was like, come on, McClellan, work with me here. And he just couldn't. So all of the failures around Pope joined in in blackening his reputation to save their own. Nathaniel Banks, who was one of the worst political generals in the war, because not all political generals were bad. What's a political general? Somebody who had no military experience. That was pointed basically. Yeah, I had a constituency. Like Segal had the German-American constituency. He was bad. Banks had the New England working class constituency. He was bad. Logan had the southern Illinois dangerously pro-successionist constituency. He brought them in on the union side and he fought extremely well. I mean, for that matter, I suppose you could call somebody like Forest a political general in that he didn't have any military experience. He just, he was born killer and he knew how to do it. As Pope says in his memoirs about Banks, to major general banks who wrecked his core by bringing on a general engagement with Stonewall Jackson's much larger command at Cedar Mountain contrary to Pope's orders, Banks then tried to deflect the blame to Pope before the joint congressional committee on the conduct of the war. Pope bore him no ill will. Yeah, Pope is for somebody who's supposed to be prickly and bombastic. His memoirs are both really eloquent and a lot more forgiving than I can imagine being. Something seemed to happen to him after he was railroaded out of the war in the Battle of Second Manassus. That kind of thing can drive some people insane, but it sort of drove Pope into this strange peaceful place where he tended to see the right and do the right. It still maintained that Porter and McClellan had wronged him and I would say he was absolutely right. Because what happened on that last day of the battle, Longstreet is coming up, but he's far away. He can't get there within several hours. Porter is supposed to attack. Porter refuses to attack. Just as he did a little later at Antietam when a decisive victory was within McClellan's trembling hands. That was Porter who didn't attack? Well, he's one of whispered in McClellan's ear. I'll go in if you want me to, General, but remember I control the last reserve of the last armament. Yes, yes, okay. But you know, he was still willing to fight in his late years. He got involved in a long controversy with no less than Louis Philippe Abbeur d'Orl\u00e9ans, Comde Paris, a French nobleman who had served under McClellan. It's typical McClellan. I mean, you don't just get a foreigner. You get some snotty right-wing aristocrat and he becomes your big partisan. So basically, Pope said, well, to this guy, you're supposed to be exonerating McClellan and Porter, but you say they did what I said they did. So how was that an exoneration? And it just ended that. Even Halleck who insisted on chaining him to his position, which was a hopeless one, he has rather a beautiful summary of Halleck because the latter part of his memoirs after he gets second monastic office chest is people he'd known in the war. And he's talking about Halleck who was a freak even by local standards. It is funny at the same time, sad considering what happened to think of them in those days. Halleck was a union man, but at best exceedingly conservative, he was an unlovely man, which is a nice word. I think most people said obnoxious and physically repulsive. But he rendered valuable service in reorganizing the department and establishing its business on systematic and efficient foundation. I don't think I really have time to do the rest of his verdicts on his enemies and his so-called friends. But I would recommend reading the, again, military memoirs of General John Pope. It helps to have the geography of northern Virginia in mind. Again, you can't just do it with the maps either because to understand why Porter was a traitor, you need to have a clock going while you're looking at the map. It needs to be an interactive map. Porter did eventually attack in a half-hearted way and got a lot of men slaughtered so that he could say he did, but it was far too late to affect any change in the outcome of the battle. Which Porter knew would get Pope offstage, which it did. There he was in the Minnesota, swatting mosquitoes while the rest of the Army of the Potomac was still in the war. Yeah, it's really. It's amazing the infighting that went on and Lincoln, again, this is one of the things that I think sort of changed my opinion of Lincoln as a wartime general because what seemed like sort of at times maybe a bit of dithering on his part, a bit of passivity was more like an outsider trying to manage a bunch of trees and aspsicos that he had to manage. He didn't have a choice. You couldn't just fire the whole lot of them because God knows what had happened to you. I mean, this is wartime you have to have, like it or not, you know, the West Point elites and at least some of their plutocrats on board with you if you don't. The whole war effort could be screwed, so he had to be delicate about it. He just gets drool occasionally about some of these guys like after saying how McClone was the most exquisite exponent of ideas. He says basically the North had forgotten war. They hadn't had a war in a long time and they trusted these guys who were supposed to know about it from West Point and those guys were fakes. He said in the professional mind, McClone was the ripest production of West Point, which of course implies that he might have been considered overripe for any other institution of learning in the country. That's popes from popes. Yep. A book, yeah, that's great. Yeah, oh yeah, some great ones. But you know, he still died more or less discredited and if anything, the the verdict against him has been intensified, which is just weird beyond belief. Yeah, I mean, the wiki thing you read off in the beginning, wiki is sort of like the that's when it's filtered down to that level of common knowledge. Yeah, yeah. Very strange. Is that part of the whole? The losers wound up winning, you know, the other war? Absolutely, yeah. Yeah, yeah, thanks for mentioning that because that's an important dimension to this. As I implied, but didn't say clearly, the reason Porter was pardon was not that the testimony had changed. You read Logan's speech rehashing the testimony against him and it's clear he was guilty as hell. Times had changed. Basically, the the Northern elite felt that to make money and keep things moving without disturbance, which was the stronger party in the south, the Friedman or the White Southerners. They decided pretty simply, oh, the White Southerners, so let's let them have their moral victory. Let's let them reassume control of their states without doing any of the reforms that people like Senator Sumner or Gorausky knew would have to happen. Otherwise, they would just this former slaves would simply be slaves in all but name. They agreed to all of that because it was good business, basically. This is a strange way of looking at it, but there's a parallel here to how imperialist powers prefer dealing with centralized autocratic local elites because you can just do better business with them. I mean, if power had been massively democratized as was the direction it was going after the civil, you know, with the victory of the North and the Civil War, you'd have had to deal with, well, it's harder to do business. I mean, you'd have to deal with a messy democracy, but if you have a bunch of, you know, a handful of local rich autocrats, it's easier to do business with them. Like the British policy in Nigeria is constantly trying to be dealing with. Yeah, yeah, you deal with the Sultanate in northern Nigeria. All you have to do is talk to one autocrat. You try to deal with the Epo in Southeastern Nigeria. Every one of them is an oratorical genius and they all have different ideas and it makes my life a hell, a living hell, as Beetlejuice would have said if he were a British colonial officer. So yeah, it's hands down. You deal with the autocrats. Yep. I mean, it's easier to, it was thought easier by the American elites to deal with Yeltsin and a fake democracy in a handful of oligarchs than, you know, what Gorbachev was trying to build, which is something more like a, like a socialist democracy. Viewer opportunities, more messy. And, yeah, oligarchs, you can, it's just easier to do business with. Yeah, that's pretty grim, though. It's kind of, but it's also ironic in a sense because all these lost causers, like their whole southern system was kind of, it was actually in a sense a product of northern imperialism rather than, you know, we fought back and we, well, let them think they fought back. Let them think that they created the solstice. I mean, I don't think it's quite that simple because it really was brutal and, you know, and all that. But like, there was some truths to that. Oh, there was a sense throughout the Northern elite that, yeah, we know they're doing terrible things down there. That's, well, we know, even FDR, as you've said many times, made that compromise. Like, yeah, I know, but they vote with me when it counts. Yeah. All right. Let's take a quick break and then wrap up the show. Okay. That was music there by our man, Brendan Andreg. And we usually put links up where you can find his music. We've had people asking and thrilljockey.com. Brendan's a pretty darn famous music guy, which we didn't really find out until shortly after we started working with them. Yeah. It was Alex, Alex, I check a friend of the show journalist who I think put us in touch. And then we saw a work with Brendan. I was like, wow, his music is really good. And then I looked at like, whoa, Brendan's actually famous. Like, pitchfork reviews. Everything Brendan puts out. I want to say. Yeah. Pretty famous by my books. But also, and you put out great music. So, if you want to order more Brendan's music, we'll have the links there. How long ago did you stop touring, Brendan? The last time we went was probably 2006. What sort of places? Where did you go? It's old. It's not all the glamour. All over the place. Yeah. I think in your like younger mid-twenties, it's fun to get into the proverbial van and go place the place as exhausting as it can be. But like, do you ever do any of those festivals? I can't stand as a, you know, spectator in music festivals. There's so much bigger now than when I was younger. It seems like. Yeah. We've done a lot of festivals in Europe to like Primavera and places like that. There's a great Patty Smith line. I wasn't born to be a spectator. Yeah. Yeah. She made no bones about that. My favorite Patty Smith moment is in the mid-70s at CBGB's. Blondie started getting popular in that early CBGB scene with the Ramones and Patty Smith and a couple others and she went to the management at CBGB's and said, they have to stop playing. It's either them or me and I'm bigger than they are. So, CBGB, so Blondie was banned for a while from CBGB's. Wow. Yeah. People have the power to get it. People fired. Yeah. Me especially. I can have the power. Crucial. Yeah. Anyway. So, speaking of power, let's wrap up the second battle of Manassas. You know, as you said, the defeat of the union side, 14,000 casualties essentially led to the destruction more or less of the army of Virginia. The dissolution anyway. There was a lot of organizational chaos on both sides early in the war. In some theaters, some armies are actually hard to trace because they changed their name and their composition so fast. But yeah, it's certainly ruined Pope's career. But on the positive side, it ruined Porter's career, at least long enough that he was out of war for good. That was probably a really big gain for the union. And even in terms of the lopsided death toll, the brutal fact is that it was easier for the north with a much bigger population to replace their casualties than for the south because in the early days of the war, the elite youth of the south came to northern Virginia because they assumed that's where the fight was going to be. So, these casualties told on the south. And eventually they didn't have anyone to replace them, which is why Claiborne, who was like the last sane person in the south, said, I think at the end of 1863, we're going to have to free and then recruit black people, which destroyed his career and got him killed a little later. But yeah, the Confederacy couldn't really replace those casualties. Lee was emboldened enough to get above himself, I would say, and attempt an invasion of Pennsylvania, which ended in the Battle of Antietam, which was more or less a bloody stalemate, but very bloody for the south as well. And the single bloodiest day in American history up to that point. And then was driven back into the Confederacy from that, as he was in the Gettysburg campaign as well. I would say, strangely enough, the battle was kind of a wash, kind of a draw. It was a disaster for Pope, and it was a disaster, obviously, for the killed and the maimed, but in strategic terms, it's more what Pope could have done if they'd sent his entire army to the east. I think frankly, they could have wrapped Lee up easily. But as it was, the army wasn't entirely destroyed, the North had pretty much endless capacity to form new armies. It did knock out sort of McClellan's right hand, McClellan's little warm tongue. And I just finished with this beautiful comment by Pope in his memoir where he's talking about the first battle of Bull Run, which he did not take part in terms which are meant to be heavily ironic for people who know the story. One of the reasons that first battle of Bull Run was lost for the Union is that this elderly Irish American commander named Patterson was in command of the army that was supposed to block off the Shenandoah Valley, failed to do that completely and allowed Joe Johnston to march eastward to Bull Run to join the Confederate forces. So he says joining Patterson as a guide, philosopher and friend was that impetuous soldier and desperate fighter fits John Porter, a perfectly logical result followed. Johnston marched away to Bull Run that is right past them and determined the result of that battle. Patterson and Porter remained to adorn the village of Winchester. So that's, you know, he finishes off people with the glove in these things. And I suppose that was a good revenge because I'm sure that Porter as McClellan definitely did live the rest of his life basically stewing in his own bile and having done that for a few years, it's no fun. Yeah. And probably reducing his circle of contacts only to people who are willing to listen to it and indulge it as well. Yeah. Oh man, thanksgiving at the Porter family. I hate to imagine. Oh, you imagine the double Thanksgiving in the McClellan Porter Thanksgiving. Yeah, the nephews would be playing trigger games with them. So everybody in Northern Virginia. Oh my god. All right. Well, this is a great episode. I'm glad I think a lot of our listeners, most all of our listeners think will be really glad to have gotten another entry into the Warner Civil War series. This is entry number 12 episode number 12 in our series. We'll post the other series in case you have been to have joined us later and missed a few of these.
