    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. Today is January 26, 2023. And this is episode 363. I'm the coast, Mark Ames, up here on Lake Ontario, Western New York. And I am on the line with the Warner himself, John Dolan, aka Gary Betrayer, aka The Warner. And by the way, you're listening to Radio Warner. That's Patreon-Ford slash Radio Warner. First of all, hey John, how you doing? Hey, well, I'm here in, I'm not in Tunis anymore. I'm in Hamamette, which is across the neck of the peninsula. The Tunis is on the left side of the peninsula, the west side. Hamamette is on the east side. And the ruins of Carthage are sort of toward the end, the northern end of the peninsula. And we're going to go see the ruins of Carthage tomorrow. And I'm really looking forward to that, because, you know, Roman ruins, yeah, diamond doesn't. But whatever is left of Carthage, that's Punic stuff and that's not as common. Yeah. Well, I guess since you were in Italy, you probably had enough of Roman ruins for a while. But yeah, Carthage, how much is left? That's what I'm going to find out. I don't really know yet. I think human relations are going to occupy a lot of my time, because we met the tour guide at a pub with English football flags all around it. And that promises to be a social intensive out in. But we'll see. And we might have to do something on Carthage, right? I mean, you're going to see it. I want to do something on Carthage, but yeah, we'll need to prep. So start prepping. Yeah. So John, before anything, I know you're also, you're in transit now. You had to leave, well, turn out to be your favorite city since, at least since we've started this show, which is Triesta. But you're now in Tunis and you're going to be heading to the UK soon. And there's going to be a radio-wanderer meetup there, right? Yeah. And I want to announce that for everybody. Everybody's welcome to come to this RWN meetup in London on February 7th at 7 p.m. at the old white bean, or is it bear? POP! I'm sorry. I like old white bean because I can feel like one. Probably bear, huh? Yeah. The old white bear pub at any rate. It's a building that's at one, the number one, well-road, W-E-L-L-road. And the post code, which is more useful, is N, N as in Nancy, W, as in W, three, N-W-3-1-L-J. The old white bear pub, one well-road. And you get there on the hamstead underground, or the hamstead Heath overground. And this is all thanks to friend of the show, Amelia Lies, author of Think Like a Vegan. I have that book. Great book. Yeah, okay, good. So you're going to be on London. Yeah, okay, good. So you're going to be on London, well, by February, I guess, is it going to be... Yeah, we're going north to Scotland after that, because, you know, well, various reasons. But we're going to be in London for a while. And yeah, we'll be there in case anybody wants to drop by, say hello on February 7th. And we should have some friends of the show up in Scotland as well. I think point of number. Yeah, yeah. So that should be... Are you going to Glasgow or Edinburgh? Or do you... The Oscar's a Glasgow. Mm-hmm. Okay. I have to practice my Glasgow kiss. I'm trying to think of bad, transbotting jokes, which is, you know, the crudest thing I can think of when I think of Scotland, you know, short. Anyways, sorry. Right, so let's get going to our interview. I mean, last year at the, sort of the year-end review episode we did, it was the worst of times. That's the end of 2022. You talked about how you wanted to discuss more the incredible Department of Defense budget going up to a trillion dollars. And nobody even batting an eye about it. No, it's frightening. It is frightening. I mean, I even remember, you know, in the Reagan years when these budgets went up, there was at least a pretend pushback, you know, an outrage constantly. I mean, it was almost... It was like a feature of, you know, the next defense. And in fact, they kind of fed off of it, the Republicans, ha-ha-ha. You don't like this budget increase, and we're going to do it anyway. And now it's just sort of like, trillion dollars, yeah. If anything, it's the centrist who are pushing it hardest. And the people are trying to be obnoxious right wingers who are grumbling about it. It's just too weird for me. It is weird. In fact, we don't talk about this, but it seemed like the most controversial thing about the budget was that... Were the vaccine mandates. And the right-fought hardest on that... I mean, they're talking about reducing the defense budget possibly. We're cutting it as part of like a general cut of everything in government. But those vaccine mandates had to go. And even on that, the progressives are the center, center, left, caved. I mean, I guess it's the least offensive thing in there, but it's kind of ridiculous that that's where the big battle was, you know. We are strange people. Yeah, very strange. Yeah. Right, so anyway, let's get to our interview with Andrew Coburn, friend of the show, former guest and Harper's editor in Washington, DC. All right, we are really honored to have back with us, friend of the show, previous radio Warner guest, Andrew Coburn. Andrew is the author of the book, Spoils of War, Power Profit in the American War Machine. So he's very obvious. Go to guest for the subject that we're going to talk about today, which is the DOD budget. Anyway, he also has a great sub-stack that I subscribe to, and I recommend you to call the Spoils of War. It's grim stuff, but has enough humor in it to help it go down. I mean, it's pretty insane, insane stuff about, I mean, the latest graft story out of Washington. And he's also been a guest on several radio-warnored episodes. I see episode 57. We talked about Yemen. So to 191 on Pentagon's Sleeze, it's the favorite topic of ours. And episode 296, when his book, The Spoils of War, came out. Andrew is also the Washington, DC editor of Harper's Magazine. Andrew, welcome back to the show. Hey, great to be with you. Thanks for coming on. Yeah, thanks very much. So getting to that trillion dollar baby moment here with the Pentagon budget. You know, I was going back through some of my older notes. And just let me just read this off to you. This is Washington Post February 24th, 2014. So we're literally talking like a day or two before the the the Mideon Revolution or coup. It was a coup, we call it a revolution. Anyway, this is February 24th, 2014 headline. Once a gun blueprint would cut army size as military adjusts to leaner budgets. Save by the bell, save me. Fortuna has blessed the weapon's contractors. You know, there's just endless, I remember these stories. And it was like the timing was just so uncanny. The Defense Department of Monday proposed cutting the army to its smallest size in 74 years, flashing a class of attack jets, rolling back personnel costs in an effort to adjust the department buoyed by a decade of war to an era of leaner budgets. What happened, Andrew? Well, I think I said, but just within a day, well, a day after, I think I've told the story before, maybe, but a day after the, what have you wanted to call it, occupation, liberation conquest of Crimea? I happened to be having lunch with a friend of mine who was a lobbyist, who told me that just that morning he had been at a fundraising breakfast hosted by Congressman Mike Rogers, port and dead as some of the military industrial machine. And the other attendees were mostly defense lobbyists. I said, what was the mood? What were they talking about? I call the mood borderline euphoric. Wow. Yeah. Which as a ghost, your point, what happened? What happened? You know, we have an $158 billion defense budget, up 10% on last year. I mean, by some yad sticks, we already have a trillion dollar defense once you've been throwing a few other things like national security related things, including the interest on the debt that be accrued for all that. What's been really remarkable as I was prepping for the show is that this doesn't seem to be big news in most places. You sort of have to go to the edges of the net to find any shock or even disturbance about it. And the figure itself, like what are we talking about? That hasn't been featured much. I remember reading a book about the financial collapse of Europe between the war, between World War I and World War II, and talking about the German inflation. And as inflation sort of grew to several thousand per cent a day, people lost all sense of numbers. So they were starting to say, well, I'm 47 million years old and things like that. And I think it's become like that. You know, people have lost. It's so gargantuan. It's so vast that people sort of lost all grip. I mean, the increase, this year's budget or the FY23 budget is 80 billion up on last year, right? That's more than the defense budget actually by some of Russia, I think, certainly of the sort of UK. I mean, the only country that hasn't, the defense budget is not, the defense budget increase is not bigger than is China, which are pacing threat. Remember the pacing threat? I love that phrase. Pacing threat, which is sort of limping along at 293 billion. So it's just, you know, what do you mean? I mean, I'm not up much with journalism. I know I usually have to ask Mark, but I have a strong sense that there used to be defense correspondence at the major news sites. And yeah, they were kind of home team cheerleaders, but at least they had some knowledge of it. And I was looking for articles on the B21, like why are we still funding a human piloted bomber as you ask in one of your articles in 2023? And that hasn't come up much. I mean, the best article I found was a five year old blog by an ex-USAF kernel. It's astonishing. There's this sort of raw, you know, they were all flown out for the unveiling of the B21 to Palmdale and the defense correspondence all talked about it's, you know, wonderfully stealthy characteristics and how cool it looked and how cool the presentation was, you know, with all the blue lighting and the music. I remember that on social media, all the journalists were just, they were openly, they weren't hiding it because there used to be a slight sense of, maybe this isn't socially correct to openly gloat and celebrate it. So I'll try to be a little ironic. There was none of that at all. Just pure tongue out of the mouth gloating. Well, yeah, I mean, maybe for your audience, we don't need to go in what a ridiculous sort of pork laid in. Oh, let's do it. For all police. Please. Yeah. I mean, for a stop, they're spending whatever, I think the program is currently pegged at $200 billion, $203 billion, which will be more. And it doesn't actually, you know, it's replacing the whiskered, you know, TARDL B2, which actually isn't that old. But as far as I can see, it doesn't, it isn't that much different. I mean, maybe, you know, there's some design features that have been altered, but it basically, you know, it won't be any more or less visible to radar. Yeah, I noticed that the CEO of Northrop Grumman had a very tell-tale remark about the B21. The stuff that you don't see is the best stuff. It really requires Emperor's new clothes, leap of faith. Right. Well, as I remark that, you know, the thing is stuff you don't see is actually what it's costing us, you know. For a while, you know, they tried to, they said that the actual cost, projected cost of this was classified. Yeah, right. It was because the Russians and the Chinese would say, you know, they're spending 12 minutes. We can overspend too. Yeah, but that might spur the Chinese to competition. In fact, I'm writing, I'm writing thinking I think it took one of the few actually halfway, competent defense journalists left Tony Capacci at Bloomberg. I think he was the one who told us, actually gave us the cost. I mean, he actually got someone to tell him the cost, which we should all know already. So, you know, it's completely absurd. It's just the Air Force amazingly, you know, how far are we from the, well, let's say, when do we have an invaluable nuclear deterrent with the Polaris missile, which came in, I mean, they were 1960 or something. So that's, that's 60, 63 years ago. Since then, we haven't needed ICBMs and we certainly haven't needed strategic bombers. No. But they got the triad, supposedly, became the ultimate guarantee of a short destruction. And the thing is that people believe and accept that this technology is evolving very quickly, but somehow they also accept that the triad is something like the military equivalent of the Trinity. It's basically... Yeah, yeah. I think the put the bomber down as the holy ghost, you know. Right. That's what you don't see. Exactly. Exactly. And you know, in a way that this thing about the technology rapidly evolving and kind of, it is and it isn't. I mean, it's all in the, you know, micro-circuitry and electronics. Well, I think to the extent that in 1945, it might have been hard to or 1955. You might have been able to design a bomber that could evade Russian air defense, especially with what we know now about Russian air defense at the time. But then, first of all, the high altitude became untenable because they could shoot down the U-2, which could fly as high as you wanted. And then programs like the B-58 got canceled because their whole mode was to go really high, really fast. And that didn't work anymore. And then it was terrain following. And now, and then that will work against low tech opponents. And we've had a lot of low tech opponents or poorly-trained opponents. But it's not likely to work. It's also not necessary to work because nobody can really stop a sub-launched ICBM. But now they've come up with yet another thing to extend the life of this weapons platform that has no real reason to exist, which is stealth. And whether you believe in stealth or not, it's at least hard to prove one way or the other. Well, you know, it is a point about stealth. You know, what they talk about a lot is the magical coating, the invisibility cloak that this thing is supposedly made of or the skin is made of. And all the special round-eat surfaces, so that all the radar can be deflected. But actually, that's only part of what the source stealth concept is. The whole idea that you can know where the enemy radars are and the radio, you know, the enemy sensors, their defense sensors, and you sort of go around them. And so that's a huge part of the F-35, the whole program. And so there's a whole mission data set that's actually meant to be updated daily into the planes, software, computer. So you know exactly where the Russians have moved or the Chinese or whoever, but it goes by region. So let's say we talk about Russia or around Ukraine. You know, the Russians have got an air defense radar here and there's a civilian airport there and you know, all the rest. So it has this sort of electronic map and it's memory. And that all comes from an office at Eglenevore space, so it meant to be in charge of sort of updating the things. And the last thing I heard, maybe slightly other day, but there were six months behind. Yeah, that was one of the most astonishing things you revealed in this series of articles you've done about the defense budget. I presume that's because it's not a sexy. I mean, the word sexy is used in procurement circles, you know, very bitterly, ironically, well, very cynically, let's say. And I guess, you know, it's a few salaries. It's not worth funding. It's not going to make a lot of money for anybody. Yeah, that's exactly it. You know, that's all that you know, it's people think I'm sort of, you know, being a bit silly and sort of whatever. When I say it's all about the money, it's always all about the money and nothing but the money. But that's a good example. You know, if it's not, if it isn't a brick procurement contract or something that looks good and a super bell ad, I mean, which is the case with the B21, I mean, I think they had a super bell ad for the B21 before the B21 was actually sort of made. And then the, in his face of the commercial came first. And then the, and you remember with the B2, the first we saw the B2 was a Toyota commercial Toyota figured out what it was probably going to look like and sort of made an ad. So we had the ad and then we had the real thing, which was invisible. Well, yeah, this, this corruption is right out in the open. Like I, one of the few sites I found is, is by a retired USAF Colonel William Aster. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, he's pretty, he's pretty good. Yeah, and he was actually breaking this down five years ago. He, he said, the lead contractor, the B21 Northrop Grumman of false church Virginia. And I thought, Oh, God, false church Virginia really. And then United Technologies of East Hartford, Connecticut, B.A.E. of Nashwa, New Hampshire, spirit, arrow systems of Wichita, Kansas, orbital ATK of Clearfield, Utah, Dayton, Ohio. I mean, all these towns with no doubt powerful senior Congress people who get dropped a little cash in the process. Well, here's the point about that map. I remember that, which was, it was also came out with the Pogo project on government oversight, which is, that was when they were still saying the total cost was classified. But they were telling were saying where the pork was going. Right. And you're right. I mean, they all, they were all those major, you know, major contracted the prime contractors for this thing. We're all carefully situated in the, in the districts of important, important congressman and senators. You know, I mean, it was a, an egregious case of political engineering. Yeah. I mean, you would think that if they were really worried about Russian and Chinese spies, they wouldn't tell them where all the different components were being made. Here's a map where you could go, you know. Yeah. Of course, what they hope and that was the point is what they hope and pray for is, is for the Chinese to come up with a B, with a B21. That would be great. One of the things that gives me hope that we might prevail over the middle kingdom is that the Chinese at one point went to all the trouble of stealing all the data on the F-35. This is like in, as it then was in 2008 or 9, I think there was a major hack and some Chinese electron electronic intelligence unit got away with, you know. And the flight list F-35 as we call it. I'm sure they were sped on that way. I mean, I'm sure it was made easy for the probably go to the password because, you know, one, two, three. One thing to do that. Yeah, that's true. The bombers that it's replacing, it's a pretty incredible story. I mean, it's not replacing the B-52. Nothing ever replaces the B-52 because that actually works. Yeah. And the B-52 is one fault if it has a fault is that it, it's sort of like the A-10. It is not. It doesn't have planned obsolescence built into it. And that is obviously probably its biggest fault from these points of view. But the B-1, and I'm old enough to remember what a big deal that was Reagan versus Carter, that Carter killed it at first and maybe was going to rise and then Reagan. Like this was going to really be a big comeback. None of those even fly anymore. There's like a half a dozen that still fly or something. And even the B-2, it's hard to find any of those that fly and only 20 were ever made. That's just as long as you're going to make 100 of them. Yeah. And then this is one of the ways you lie about procurement. You say, yes, okay, if we only make a few of these, it'll be really insanely expensive like you'll think when you hear it. If we make a lot of them, oh boy, you know, they'll go down in price so much. And then of course that doesn't happen because they all need refits and repairs. Yeah. But the important thing to remember about the B-1 and the B-2 is the B-1 was the Republican bomber. Right. And the B-2 was the Democrat bomber. Right. And the B-21 is a bipartisan bomber. Well, that's right. I mean, something we can get onto and just come up here about the defense budget. People say, you know, the thumb suckers lament the passing of the age of bipartisan consensus on Capitol Hill. Well, it's we've got it in spades. I mean, it's totally bipartisan with the defense budget. And, you know, I mean, a very good example of bipartisanship, I thought, fine stirring example of bipartisanship was when Rand Paul proposed the sort of oversight mechanism for all the junk was sending to Ukraine and all the money. I think it was voted down 99 to one. Wow. Wow. And overwhelming majority and all he was asking for was something like they had in Afghanistan, the special inspector general, John subco who, you know, the Pentagon and State Department, the US side, the bureaucracy considered a royal pain in the ass, which he was saying he was. And Paul was the suggesting some of us something similar for Ukraine. And he might as well have, you know, said he was in love with Putin or something. I know. I know. It's treason oversight is treason at the moment. Yeah. Oh, yeah. In fact, the, you know, the national defense authorization, the NDAF. Yeah. It's become like our sort of almost like a governing mechanism. I mean, there's a thing you know, it's going to pass. So the big thing is to get an amendment on whatever you, you know, you care about him. And by favorite amendment is the, and this one is the Ginny Thomas immunity bill. You know, yeah. I mean, it's a, it's a murder. It's a murder. The wife of Justice Clarence Thomas is this sort of demented. That winger who was, you know, taking a leading part in the effort to overthrow the 2020 election and was digging deep in the planning for January 6th. Yeah. And people were also pointing out the perhaps considerable sums of money she's holding in. So they base someone, some kind of sells stuck in a amendment in the NDAA to say you couldn't investigate the families of senior members of the judiciary. Hmm. Who do they have in mind? Well, yeah. So it's called, it wasn't that they called it the Ginny Thomas immunity bill. Wow. And that was, that was in the, in the defense act. Yeah. Because you know it's going to pass. Yeah. So as soon as you can persuade the, the leadership, you know, to let you let them get your amendment in your home free. There was one comment in one of your articles. These are the recent articles about the defense budget by Andrew Coburn. That said, something to the effect of the defense industry is the American industry. So the defining, right. So you can actually claim that aside from what happens in, in war where a tiny quantity of very expensive weapons, obviously will not work for very long. You can say, even in peacetime, this is good for America because it's really the only thing we do anymore. I mean, I took that quote from, it was an article by Lauren Thompson, a consultant of Easy Virtue for the Lockheed and various other people. But it was, I thought, was pretty interesting. And he actually goes through, you know, the, particularly not some of these states, he talks about Arkansas and a couple of others, where the state economy is pretty much totally dependent on defense spending. Defense spending, I mean, you know, so would be reduced to sort of, practically Haitian levels, if it, if they lost these defense contracts, I mean, he was making the point, he thought was just great. What a lock defense spending now has on the economy and we just, we cannot, if we ever could, but certainly cannot now do without the permanent more economy. I was looking at some articles on the, on the NDA that passed at the end of last year, this giant, you know, let's say trillion dollar budget that passed. And, you know, one of them here, so it passed the Senate 83 to 11. And I think an 8% increase over 2022, 8% jump is, I'm not even sure that includes the Ukraine spending, I'm not sure. 8% jump is the sort of shocking jump levels that happened under Reagan in the early mid 80s, this is not recall people like about 10% I guess under, under Reagan. I mean, this is, or, or like after the war on terror started, like these are massive massive increases. And what's interesting is in this article here, I'm looking at, so it goes through, you know, the, all the different things that are being increased. And the first quote from a lawmaker is Chuck Schumer, Democrat Senate Majority Leader. And what does he say? Quote, China. It's actively, actively trying to undercut American interest and partnerships. Every, so it's about China. It's really interesting, you know, because I don't know, it's, it's weird. I mean, the, the Russian invasion is kind of, it's both scared people. So it's, it has shut people up who may be opposed this sort of thing. And so it silenced a lot of voices, but at the same time, it should also say, you know, Russia spent eight months trying to take buck moots. And, you know, they might get it, but like, how can we pretend that they threatened? Right all of Europe. So it's trying to try to now. Right. It's, yeah, the pacing threat is like, I mean, I went to there was a, it was sort of defense industry conference. I went to a few weeks ago, sponsored by one of the political offshoots. I wish you got political national security, whatever. And they had, you know, panel and was quite a heavy hitting sort of panels of speakers, you know, the chief of staff of the army, the senior Pentagon guy in charge of China and Congress, senior congressional types. And it was actually, it was at the same time, mind, mind not only boring, because they all sort of chanted these platitudes, at the same time, terrifying, because occasionally I've sort of wake up and hear someone saying, it's not a matter of if, but when we have the war with China. Wow. There are variations on that remark, you know, all day long. I mean, I was, that's insane. Do they really, I hate asking that question, but I got to ask it. Do they really believe that? They really think like that? I mean, it's, yeah, I mean, I asked myself like, I mean, I'm a sucker for that question too. I always want to ask that. Like, what happens when they go home and they're talking to their near and dear ones? Is it the same tone? They occasionally remember to add the tagline if the Terrence fails. But in a way, I mean, it comes to a really important point, which is, supposing you say, okay, do they believe it? If they really believed it, then for example, why do they spending, you know, like, the Georgians of dollars send aircraft carrier, build aircraft carriers to go close to China where they, you know, everyone agrees they'd be sent to the bottom and finish order. Yeah. And in the one way they sort of profess us is fervent sort of faith, the deep rooted faith in, you know, the coming war with China. And at the same time, the sort of refusal to connect that with actual possible military realities. You see what I'm saying? That's, I think maybe they, maybe the some filter in the brain that when you say war with China, that actually means it's like a sort of, you know, hash in, you know, encryption, which actually is, you know, the hash code translates into a password and sort of, I've been learning about this because I've been following the tribulations of Julian Assange. And this is one of the main accusations. But anyway, they, so I think when they say the coming war with China, I think that's in there. That's actually a translate to their brain into bigger defense budgets. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Right. Right. Yes. Yes. Right. Yes. Always create a scenario where it will go to this level, but it won't go to 11 as in, yeah. While China feels truly threatened. So it just decides to wipe out that part of the Pacific in which the fleet is known to be. Right. You know, it reminds me that there was one of my sort of favorite books about the like bullets into this situation is a book called the Air Force plans for peace. Which urge you to try and get hold of, which is about the Air Force's fight for independence during the war and immediately afterwards. Like I call Perry McCoy Smith, who amazingly is career survived. He was an air, he became an Air Force general. Anyway, he, um, and then he happens to mark that at the end of the war, the they were looking around for not this Air Force they've been planning to have independent Air Force. What it would actually sort of be for. And they thought would it be, you know, to defend against Russia to attack Russia and they said, well, Russia isn't a serious power because it doesn't have a strategic bombing force. And the Navy meanwhile was saying Russia isn't a serious part because it doesn't have aircraft carriers. You know, they were, they could only think in sort of mirror images themselves. Right. And they, but then they'd read the papers about this thing called the United Nations that was being created. And they said, well, what is the mightiest power on this, obviously United, if you have well government, then what a well government need law enforcement. And what is the most person distrust of force in the world is the United States strategic bombing force. So we can be the UN police force. That was the. Wow. That's kind of the genesis of it. Yeah. Interesting. Purecratic needs drive a lot of this. There is an interesting piece I saw in Pogo when we were kind of preparing for this. I read some stuff from Pogo, which you've talked about and recommended as well. And this was a piece last. From this blog section called the bunker. This was last November. I'm sorry, December, December 14, 2022. About the what's supposed to be the successor to the V22, you know, the tilt rotor. Yeah, program. And they. So they've come up with this new boom doggo, which is the V280 valor. Right. And it's a, you know, it's going to be a could lead to, let's see, could lead to $70 billion in US and overseas. Yeah. So it's a huge thing. This is a huge thing. And they go on about it and everyone's, you know, most people will sort of argue, you know, was Boeing's version better than the other guys version. And, you know, do we definitely need this or do we not need this? But sort of way down in the article, they said, well, if they didn't come up with this, then was the army's airborne sort of fleet would be or this like a whole section of the army would be cut out. Because so yeah, the army is defined as I mean, it can have helicopters. Right. Without helicopters or something that can be called a helicopter. Right. It's not supposed to have any air force. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Yeah. Because the backbone of, you know, it's what they use to move troops around is what they use to take troops into when you're landing, you know, into an LZ, a landing zone and certain troops somewhere. You know, maybe under, you know, in combat conditions, this will be the thing. I mean, I'm actually very interested in this because the Marines you remember, they came up with the osprey with the V22, which killed a whole bunch of Marines. The result of which, so I'm informed, basically, if you try and come down too fast, it crashes. Or very likely to crash, which is what you want to do if you're landing somewhere where there's opposition, people are shooting at you. Right. That is an inherent problem that can't be solved. I mean, you can't, so there's no fix for that. Once you have, uh, till either these rotors side by side, of various reasons I can sort of vaguely begun to understand. It becomes inherently unstable and you think can flip over and anyway, around, kill. So they, um, nevertheless, the army is pressing ahead is ordered, you know, is going to have this tilt rotor replacement for the black hawk, which will, you know, I can guarantee you will all be, you know, in 10 years time, we're talking about the disaster of the valor. I mean, the army, poroed army is always coming up with new helicopter ideas, which always turn out to be disasters. There's something about the army that they can't just can't get things right. I mean, just on the other end of the scale, they keep trying to design a come up with a radio, a new radio for troops to carry kind of important basic. And the latest one, it gives, it gives the, one of the things, the problems with it, it, um, the battery is so hot, because they're giving it the very powerful battery, that it gives the troops sort of second degree burns. Oh my god. So, you know, they can't even come up with a decent radio that works in a city. Some other stuff that's just so crazy about this, less than half of the V 22 fleet today existing of the 350 less than half can be flown at any time, because there are 70 different V 22 types among the 350 flown. So, so the maintenance, I mean, everything spare parts maintenance, it's, it's all just a jumble and a mess and we'll get into the weapons that were shipped into Ukraine soon. But, um, you know, you read these things and you just wonder, well, it, you know, it's a, it's a damn good thing that the US has not fought an enemy that can fight back except, you know, from its own home country, all these years, because. You really wonder what's going to work and what when you look at the, the F 35, which is kind of like the, the lead standard, if you want of, you know, procurement disasters. The Marine Corps, one of its fetishes ever since it bought the harrier way back in the, in the Falkland war years is short take off and landing and nobody else particularly wanted that they wanted a very high tech top of the line. Plane, but the Marine Corps insisted on that so there's, there's a separate Marine Corps version with short take off and landing and that imposes massive design costs on all the other variants because it's supposed to share a single airframe. And you're always, this is, you know, this has been a scandal called gold plating for years everybody every service wants to add its particular fetish and every one of them has many, many fetishes and they're all lucrative. They're, they make a lot of money. I mean, the, the Marines are who gave us the F 35 because it started with them and they insisted on this vertical take off capability, which means in turn meant the plane had to be fat because you had to have, you know, enough intake so that it could go up and down. Manipur'scribed so you know meant for a star it was you know that killed it as a sort of any halfway decent fighter. Yeah, it always reminds me of the vehicle that the Griswold's taken national ampune American vacation. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's amazing. I'm curious do the Brits still use a harrier or that jet that so dazzled everybody in Washington and every Warner, you know, in 1982, 83 do they still use it? Yeah, they still got a few harriers left. I mean, but they, the Brits, you know, they, they bought the F 35 and actually someone's been sent as a British naval person sending me papers showing just how, how, how. How cutters, trophy him in none of them works. They had to they went to the their new aircraft carrier, the Queen Elizabeth went on a cruise to the far east last year. And they had to borrow a Marine Navy F 35 unit because so few of their planes were operational. Well, one of the weirdest things about the history of procurement is that things that originally began with a contractor's promise to do leaner, cheaper planes, tanks, weapons of any kind, always ends up costing money like in the case of short takeoff at landing STOL vertical takeoff at landing VTOL. The idea was one of the many fictions of the NATO Warsaw Pact war, which we haven't been willing to face is they're going to crater our runways and all of these expensive planes won't be able to take off. That was one of about a million, you know, little problems they had with the whole scenario, which was always fiction, but they said, so we'll come up with these lean mean cheap fast takeoff and landing planes and they were not cheap and they did not work. But it made a lot of money for some people. That's right. You know, the thing about vertical takeoff thing is you're basically building the defense of the airfield into your aircraft instead of trying to defend a long runway or whatever, you're basically doing away with the runway and you're sort of investing all that in this capability, which. I admit I'm a fan of Cold War art, you know, those paintings that were commissioned by well, Northrop Grumman and companies like that and they showed these planes taking off from, you know, little highways in the middle of Belgium with an astonished Renault looking at this plane going up. Cold War out, that's a good, we should have exhibition of that. There is occasionally I get emails that some people trying to set up. I don't know, I must check in actually a Cold War museum on the more we have the Vietnam Memorial, we have the World War II Memorial and the Korean War Memorial. And then they want to they want to Cold War Memorial with a little museum. And we get back to the question of belief and I know it's a, I know it's a naive question, but, but I keep coming back to it too is it's like if there were an existential threat, I think everybody sort of knows what production would look like in that situation. There would be a lot of money put into supply, there would be simplification of weapon systems. So I always wondered does does this gold plated few specimens of fancy expensive stuff does it mean nobody's really afraid nobody's really preparing for war. And when it goes back to the question about do they actually believe in war with China. They tell themselves they are, I mean, the other thing I just wrote with something about it, this report which is having causing a lot of talk in Washington from CSIS about, it's called empty bins and it actually goes through basically lays out how supplying Ukraine has, you know, really emptied out basically all the way. Basically all our ammo stocks are within the process of doing that. Which the author then says and this leads us to very sort of naked and afraid in face of the China China threat and how can we really have a war with China when we've pissed away all our ammunition on the war in Ukraine. I mean to summarize what it says, but of course, which he then being a beautiful member of fully paid up member of the military industrial complex. He says therefore we need to have more of a surge capacity. We need more ammunition factories and just basically got to put even more money into the, you know, into defense production and particularly ammunition and several. Isn't that happening? I mean, yeah, they all did they all do. And we should, and so it's mentioning, you know, what they're doing and using Ukraine as the excuse is to getting, you know, what the contractors always want, I've always wanted is multi procurement. At the moment, they have to say, you know, okay, if I 23 you have empty billion to buy X amount of whatever's now they want it to be able to say, you know, for the next 10 years, it's going to be like, you know, an entitled like social security or something, you're going to have, you know, here's you are guaranteed to have X billion a year. To buy, you know, this out in the other thing, I mean, shells, rockets, missiles, planes, tanks, I mean, the moment they do that just for like aircraft carriers, that's a sort of a big trend, which they get a succeeded, you know, is to is to so all all what really vestigial oversight we have will sort of go away for a lot of things and then, you know, there would be a permanent defense budget. And you you pointed me to an article in responsible state craft as well about how, for example, contractors doing Ukraine, you know, weapons work. A lot of them now are not required by the to provide the Pentagon certified cost and pricing data that is to say they don't have to say how much is. I mean, there's no oversight it's like well, we'll bill you when we're done will come up with it and bill you when we're done. Even on the same things that they've already been selling to the Pentagon for years now it's like oh no, no, no, no, now we're not going to tell you the cost we can't tell you till we till we've delivered it to you, even though we've already sold it to you at X cost all these years like it's very crazy. In a way, there's interesting, I mean, as you said earlier that the you know it's China it's all about China, but I can't be just satisfied with one war. It's really war they're making a lot of money on, you know, it seems greedy to be demanding too. Well, well, this is another one of those questions about consciousness and I know they're amateurish, but I keep wondering. Was there something like a sense of disappointment in the lobbyist world when the Russian army turned out to be such a flop like, you know, you're trying to take a die for somebody and you just tap him like Jake Lamatta doesn't fall down. He's ruining the game. When that happened, you know, in the early 90s, what they tried first of all was, you know, we were a menist, we were now in a multi-polar world with many near-pair competitors or non-pair competitors and you know, it was kind of dangerous to have. I think the that's when they started wheeling on the Iranians and the North Koreans and then, you know, but then China came along and so, you know, China was promoted to, you know, to number one near-pair competitor. That was already happening in the 90s, actually, amazingly. Then Putin, you know, Putin has been a great help because Putin was modernizing and he was putting money into the military and look at the Russians. They, you know, they're doing much better. It's also different now and they're sort of teeny things up. And we had a lot about the garasimov doctrine. Do you remember the garasimov doctrine? Yes, I know. The Russians have been slowly put back on their feet, or gradually, rapidly now. They've fixed our elections, you know, with Facebook ads or some things. Yeah, they've got $100,000 in Facebook ads. They managed to elect a US president. So they, and then it's been very interesting, so schizophrenic thing because with the Ukraine war, on the one hand, the Russians have been, you know, the hopeless and, you know, we're winning. And Putin's failing war and all that. On the other hand, there's still a threat. And somehow, they've been quite successful, getting people to hold these holy contradictory ideas in their mind at the same time. That's a part of the reason I think there is for the popularity of China because the Russians might let us down by collecting dirt. Yeah, that's the, that seems to be the problem with the two threats. It's Russia is just not formidable enough. And China seems quite formidable, but not in a way that you really want to get in a war with on their own coastline. So really, neither of those scenarios works out very well. Well, with Russia, you know, it's compensated on the one hand, you know, hopeless, you know, these hapless conscripts, all that, and then failing against Ukraine. On the other hand, Russia is ruled by this mad megalomaniac. Putin wants to conquer the world. So they sort of balance a bit there, I should think. Who knows what they'll do. That's true. There is a, there's a great, great faith in sort of the Biden world in the sheer power of malice like look, they got Sauron in charge. A few orcs might mess up, but it's still Sauron. Well, that was the, the Saddam Hussein sort of game to write like sure, rack is weak, but he's so crazy. Yeah, we got to do something about him. Yeah. Right. Well, that idea was, it was developed a bit in the late 80s when the, you know, the Soviet Union was visibly falling apart. And this what I call the main G-Bair thesis, that the Russian bear was, you know, getting main shins of the, but, and actually this was seriously propounded by Andrew Marshall, you know, the very powerful person, the Pentagon for years and years. That this would, as they sort of fell apart and, yes, where they would lash out, yes, and also spasm to conquer the world. And therefore Russia was even more dangerous. Now that it was on his knees. I've seen a lot of that in the last five, 10 years to about, there's a problem with that. It seems to me, it just like as a naive consumer of defense news, which is, they proven they can't lash out very well. Unless you actually believe they never meant to take Kiv, which is kind of ridiculous, because they're not going to take Paris or Antwerp if they can't take Kiv. But at the same time, they can lash out. If you're serious about lashing out, that means nooks. And you don't have to be a strong power. The NATO tanks could be 35 miles from Moscow, and they could lash out in that way. The Russian threat will never, never go away. That's on the beauties of the whole thing. But if they did lash out in that way, it would not be good. It would not be good for anybody. Yeah. I mean, it's interesting that even without the new, what you're just talking about, you know, nuclear lash out, implicit in why we, you know, why we have to throw everything. Sacrifice everything to, to, for a behalf of Ukraine, implicit is, you know, to stop Putin, to put in, you know, will march on to Berlin, to Paris. Yes. You know, it's like, which no, as you just said, he couldn't even take Kiv. No, that's what they say. If, if we let him come away with a, with a win with, if we let him come away with what even he thinks is anything less than a defeat, then he will, even though defeated, but he won't think it's a defeat. And this thinking he will still then therefore go on marching on to Stockholm and Berlin and Oslo and for the rest of us. Like he has the way the rhetoric is is he has to know he's defeated and has to accept it, accept it. So even if it's a bad deal, it's not good enough unless he acknowledges. Yeah. Yeah. This is the rub rub their nose in it theory, which shades into genuine loathing for Russians as Russians. And it's, it's weird because it's propounded by people who often teach the, the Versailles treaty to their students and the lesson is this was a bad idea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, one of the features of this miserable situation has been the, you know, how these so people were used to think of as sort of, or even meant to think of as vaguely on the side of the angels like the greens, you know, green. Good. And then, and you have this demented German for me, you know, and all in a bearbark, who's, you know, sounds like, I don't know, sort of Tom Kotz. Sort of Tom Kotz or someone, you know, sort of, I mean, completely crazed. Yeah. And the green, the greens and the war coalition. And, you know, over here, the Democrats are definitely the war party. I mean, it's, there's only, the only, only voices of doubts seem to be coming from the Republican right. I had to ask Mark about that and an email recently, because I haven't lived in the US for a long time. And I just asked, didn't that used to be an anti-war left? I could have sworn. Yeah, you've seen less and less, we've seen less and less of it. But I think it went away. If you remember, I think after all, think back to 1990, 1991, Bush only got his war in, you know, the 1991 war. And he had to read, there was a real battle in the Congress over that. Right. I remember Sam Nunn saying, this is not our vital interest in people like him. I think Kerry voted against it, if I remember right. Yeah. Exactly. So that, that made him in the last, I would say that we can sort of mark the passing of the anti-war left with the Kosovo, 1999 Kosovo. I remember there were, again, it was only Republicans. You had a bit of the anti-war right. But the, you know, the so-called left. Yeah. We're all for it. Yeah. So, okay. So it's been gone. It's been dead for, let's say, over 20 years. Yeah. Right. And, and reshagate seems to have put it to another level as well. I mean, it is, it's prepared the ground such that, you know, for a lot of people, this is an extension of, of reshagate. I mean, but it prepared minds for, we have to fight that battle. And, you know, if you're against Trump, yes, exactly. Yeah. Putin gave us Trump. And if we, anybody who even raises any questions about this is potentially a Putin asset. So, yeah. Yeah. Crazy. Well, there's an element of vengefulness in that too, because a lot of centrist took this with, they reacted with a, a gnashing of teeth and a real ferocity, a real hate. And this means if we do everything we can to supply Ukraine, we can kill Russians without having to send our kids. I think you, you use that phrase, Andrew, without sending our kids to get killed. I mean, I just been writing about in Harper's about the rise of ronda Santis to be an appealing figure. And I got strong indications that Trump is Trump figures that one of the things that got him elected in 2016 was not quite a part of Vladimir Putin, of course. So what got him elected was his strong stand against foreign wars, which he did much, but afterwards was, you know, that he has a strong bet on the sort of isolationist strain in the, in the Republican base. And he's going to be running quite strongly on that, because it goes to the war. It's very strange. I mean, the American public is very, I mean, my people are weird people are very like in the Republican base, as far as I can see, and I make a point of haunting comments, sections where they're still allowed. There's a lot of anti Asian hatred, quite a lot among conservative white people who support Trump, but they don't necessarily want to war. They just want to be able to badmouth people. It really comes down to that. And Trump just badmouthed Elaine Chao. I think her name is. Yeah, he called her real. This would not even have gone over on the playgrounds of Oak Park Elementary. I swear, but he called her Coco Chao and somehow that's anyway. So the centrist use China as a more effective, more plausible threat than Russia. And I think there is some ethnic hatred there too. It comes across more in the way that they shrug at anti Asian violence than anything else. But the hatred is really focused against Asians on the sort of populist right, if you want to call it that. But they don't want the war. It's strange. I don't know what to make of it. The working class, and they have a slightly more direct since a lot of them sort of all they'll know someone or had a relative who joined up in the Iraq and Afghanistan years. I think that might be part of an impulse to it. If my suspicion is correct, you're going to have Trump running against against the Ukraine war. I thought it was quite significant that when Zelensky came to speak to the Congress that half the almost half the Republicans, has Republicans didn't turn up. Wow, really? Half of them didn't show for a while. Yeah, there was a large number. It was very significant numbers. You know, didn't sit it out, just didn't turn up. Yeah. And then some that did refuse to jump up and applaud when, you know, they were meant to. And whereas among the sort of what would be or would have been in some other time, the kind of anti war left where anti militarist left wing of the Democratic Party of progressive wing, they couldn't even muster up the courage to send a letter saying, hey, we support this, but maybe we should talk. And that letter got leaked and they backed away and pointed fingers at each like not even a letter could they manage. Right. They got savage and announced and then it turned out that was actually the administration policy. Yeah, it was just sort of like unnecessary. It was just slapping them down just because they could and putting them in their place. It was pathetic. Well, yeah, I mean, Congressman Raskin, he was one of the last to sign the letter. He signed the letter and then two weeks later, when it's published, he wishes a ringing denunciation of the letter that he signed. He should put himself on trial, you know, exactly what happened was that they'd taken a decision for whatever reason early on that they wouldn't release it until they had 30 signatures, which was, you know, but silly. But anyway, and so that's why it took months to sort of get it out as they slowly accumulated signatures on one of the last of which was Jamie Raskin, who then hardly is the ink dry when he turns around and it answers it. Wow. Yeah, that's that's just horrible. And that's how anyway, that's how they lose, especially younger people. Yeah. Yeah, you know, it's just gutlessness. Let's turn it slightly a little bit to the weapons that are being sent to Ukraine, the series of game changers. Right. Your newest, really. Oh, that was very fun. Yeah, peace. More magic weapons for Ukraine. I just want to read just a little bit of it. I just want to read the opening paragraph if I can. News that the US plans to send M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine makes clear that our proxy or effort is definitely divorced from military reality. Now, this is everyone's calling this time. This is the game changer. Anyway, the Abrams by the Pentagon's own admission demands intensive maintenance and highly trained crews. Furthermore, unlike any other vehicle in the battlefield, it has poor mileage and runs on jet fuel. They're by necessitating a whole separate fuel supply system. And it was put it was Donald Rumsfeld under Ford, I guess, who forced the army to buy this jet engine monstrosity back in the 70s in order to save the failing Chrysler corporation. The Abrams and the leopards that the Germans have finally been bullied into donating are merely the latest in a steady progression of quote, jane game changers. Magic weapons hailed by virtue of their supposedly superior technology as the key to Ukrainian victory early in the war the javelin anti tank missile was cast in that role followed by the anti aircraft stinger then by the M777 howitzer, which was succeeded in turn by the high Mars long range precision strike missile and the Patriot air defense missile. And then you know, one after another they didn't necessarily change the game. So my little softball question here, but is the M1 Abrams and the leopards this one going to be the one that really turns it around or maybe not maybe not, especially as the I mean the army kept saying we don't think we should send the Abrams were not going to send the Abrams we shouldn't send the Abrams cause it's so unreliable and actually poor mileage is three gallons to the mile. And my head I thought three miles of the gallon but not three gallons. Yeah, yeah, does it have to have like a giant tanker truck next to it as it drives. Actually, you found the enough. It's not it's not not a joke. When you're during desert storm 1991, well, you know, the M1 Abrams was present large numbers. They actually had to put a sort of basically send the field when they did that sort of left hook. Yes, you know, round around the Iraqi army. They basically sent a fuel depot with it. I mean, it was they were very lucky to I mean the Iraqis if the Iraqis of brother they didn't know about the Iraqis are trying to get to that which they failed to do. But you know, it says our bottom. It is but they were so dependent, you know, such poor mileage that they actually. You know, basically had to have a tanker truck with them and it's I noticed was you know, we're sending 31 Abrams right in a year, you know, it's very you can see what the deal was with the army. It's like one of those headlines that you see in the last decade like Britain commits 500 royal Marines to Latvia. Oh, okay. That should do it. You know, 500 Marines. Well, given the Russian army's performance, he knows maybe it would. But in connection with this, I one of the trends that you reveal in the articles we're talking about is that it comes down to people not so much hardware. This is from Andrew's article about magic weapons as retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel Danny Davis, an armor veteran suggests in an instruct in an instructive article in 1945 Ukraine already has about 1700 tanks, which is not getting reported much 1700 tanks comprise largely of Soviet era models from its pre war arsenal plus subsequent donations and capital. Davis makes clear that in tank battles, technological security contributes much less to victory than crew training. He states unequivocally that if the Americans in Iraqis in the 91 Gulf War in which we fought in a tank battle had swapped weapons. The result would have been the same general norm and Schwartz call for US commander in that war said the same thing. That's really remarkable. Since I put that up, I've had comments people saying, yeah, that's right. I would have been the case. And actually, someone wrote in. I had a comment from a reader pointing out that the Egyptians have a thousand M1 tanks was we were speculating on how many of them might be running and right up. Maybe not too many. That should make Egypt into a mighty military power ready to conquer the rest of the Middle East, but it doesn't seem to be hard. It doesn't seem to work that way. It's exactly the case. But we have to claim that technology determines everything which it quite clearly doesn't. A big part of this war is sort of weapons export marketing. I imagine. But then in some cases, you would negatively. You wouldn't want to show off the M1 in a real battlefield situation. So you might really try and delay that as long as possible. If they, you know, some of these weapons systems anyways. But I mean, Russia was doing really well as weapons commercial in Syria. Now they destroyed the brand. Yeah. Exactly. You know, it's, you notice that we, we sold a record amount of arms last year. They've just come out with the figures. It's higher than ever. Wow. The defense industry is pushing for believe it or not. There are still some restrictions on arms exports. I was amazed to discover this. But. And there's a big push to sort of get rid of these irksome restrictions so they can sell even more overseas. To like because of human rights. Yeah, he and rights, you know, the lay he act and things like that. Because I read that the last NDA, there were some members of the house that were trying to hold it up to include provisions about not sending weapons to the worst human rights violators. And they, of course, caved on that. I guess that was Democrats and they cave. Oh, yeah. So yeah, we got to keep Saudi Arabia armed against Yemeni threat, for example. Yeah, in fact, you cited a book by someone called, I think Seth Jones and I ordered it after reading articles. And it's a, well, I shouldn't get into this. It's digression, but he wrote a book called Three Dangerous Men. This is, this is what the Yemen war looks like from, I guess, the Pentagon or, or the lobbyist associated with it. There's absolutely no mention of the fact that Saudi Arabia decided to intervene in a civil conflict in Yemen. It's all about look at what these houthis who are nothing but Iranian puppets have done to our friend Saudi Arabia. It's extraordinary. And, you know, speaking about consciousness, you get a sense of what a whacked out consciousness these people have. Seth Jones, he's the author of this report saying the Ukraine war has run us out of ammunition and weapons. And we have to spend, we have to get ready to be able to have a surge in defense production. I mean, it's, yeah, it's very gotten very glad you mentioned that because it's, it's as a whacked out is the word. I mean, there's deep levels of insanity in these people. Or I don't know, immorality, whatever you want to call it. So do you think going forward that these budgets are just going to keep ballooning at those levels? I mean, it's just, it's just mind boggling to me that, you know, Biden came in supposedly was going to be the most progressive president of history. You believe that? You believe that? No, I didn't believe it. But I do a lot of people on the left who wanted to believe it and therefore believed it. It was kind of crazy. And he did put forward a big program at least. I mean, usually the incoming Democrat cuts the program before inauguration day back to zero. But he, you know, he actually pushed it for a few months into office and let people call him the new FDR, the new LBJ, like LBJ+. And now we can't even get like daycare for working mothers, you know, children, like every country has it. And so we're going to go on all the other things. But, you know, ponies, galore, stuff that no one even seems the need for the defense industry. I mean, it's where are we going forward? And it's like, have we reached a point in the, it seems to me we've reached a new point in the empire where I don't, and I don't recall this seeing this before necessarily where the empire is going to be. The empire, like the national security state is overriding everything, including, you know, all a garg corporate interest with China. I mean, that as far as I can tell all this stuff about basically scaling back globalization, which has been, you know, to the American corporate world's benefit, all these decades. They're scaling back globalization and trade, they're trying to scale back, you know, trade with China in particular. None of that can be good. I would imagine for corporate America and a lot of the oligarchs, but it's a national security, the national security state seems to be leading now in areas that they hadn't really led before. And so I'm just wondering if we're really hitting this crazy new level with the empire. And if we're going to keep seeing crazy or crazy or budgets like this. We are going to go on seeing crazy and crazy budgets like this point one. Yes, I certainly agree with that. I'm not so sure corporate America is so defeated or, you know, as much to complain about here. I mean, trade with China was at a record last year. It's amazing how in the midst of economic warfare, things that are important to corporate America keep going like, for example, only 10% of America, West, well, Western firms, a lot of them American have pulled out of Russia. Right. I mean, that was obviously amazing to see that. Yeah. You know, with China, I mean, you know, Apple keeps things saying it would be impossible for Apple to pull out of, you know, to disengage from China, have moved its production base from China that the occasionally make noises about it. In a way, it gives me heart. Maybe corporate America is the last bastion against war. At the same time, corporate America, a lot of corporate America is defense corporate America. Yes. They're happy. As long as we can tick along like this, and unfortunately, you know, mothers with children needing daycare and food and they're going to get short shrift. And obviously there's an up looming assault on social security, which people ought to be thinking about. The de-globalization thing, I'm not so sure about it. You don't buy it. It still seems to be doing pretty well. I mean, you know, the whole, this is this is an effort to cut off any kind of dependence on Chinese technology. So we're bribing, you know, giving the Intel corporation, which is sort of, not exactly more a button, but it sort of, you know, doesn't innovate anymore. It's not a, it's a decline enough. Right. We shouldn't be subsidizing Intel. And we're, I think we're giving them what, $52 billion to build a plant or something. You know, it's, it's a, it's a propping up. It's kind of, you know, corporate welfare, which corporations obviously like. Right. That I don't know, I mean, I don't, I don't see too much that U.S. corporations need to be unhappy about. Oh, my God. That's a good point. I mean, all these weapons are very profitable, whatever else they are. But you can see, if there ever does, I, and I have no idea. But if there's ever a serious war against China or any other power that can rise to a level where they can have parity in all weapons and strategies, then it might turn out that the U.S., in a way that sort of reminiscent of 17th century Spain, has invested a lot in weapons that are geared to domestic constituencies in a poor, poor, poor way. Oh, yeah. And so we're going to go in with, in, into a war that will be dominated by missiles and drones with piloted aircraft and aircraft carriers. And that won't turn out well. Yeah, certainly not. But the, but take heart, take heart from the fact that the Chinese, you know, seem to be developing the wrong, rather similar lines. That is true. I mean, it's one of the puzzles to me, like, why is China stealing F-35 plans and building aircraft carriers? Like, why would you do that? Because I think, you know, I think it's a very important question. I think it's because military industrial complexes develop in the way they do without necessarily having much relation to the military threat they face. Or, you know, being allegedly being designed to face. Why is the Chinese military designed the way they do? Why, you know, is it to reinforce Xi Jinping's sort of political position? Yeah. To assuage various business interests or, you know, special interest groups in China, who for, you know, their own domestic reasons are making the demands they are. Do they really care about whether they should Taiwan or not? Right. In 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, the Pentagon was convinced it was our spending that had defeated them. We had spent them into the ground because they were forced to try and compete with our spending, and that had, you know, bankrupted them. And so there was a study set up by Andrew Marshall, basically, to verify this, to go and talk to all the sort of leading national security types in the Soviet Union, to hear what they had to say about what had been going on. So the duty was the fascinating study. But it turned out the initial report was all these national security types that, oh, well, nothing really had nothing to do with what you guys were up to. It was all due that we had 18 different kinds of missile systems because we needed employment in those cities where they were made. You know, party interest groups represented them demanded this. And so they said, that's what they bankrupted. It was nothing to do with what you were doing. So they came back, the study group came back and reported their initial report at the Pentagon, whereupon was abruptly canceled because they were coming up for the wrong, wrong policy. Yeah, that hit a little too close. So it's, you know, I mean, when we look at what the, you know, even, you know, sensible types like us, you know, we look at China, and you have been trying to think of them, yes, sort of reacting, according to national security concerns, but actually I didn't think so. There are a lot of counter examples like why did Germany build up a gigantic surface fleet before World War One was never did much of anything when the U-boat was obviously a more effective weapon for what they needed to do. Yeah, because there was a constituency for that. Absolutely. You could find copious examples throughout history for that. I think it's always the case. My favorite example is a pair of keys basically kicking off the Peloponnesian War or sort of precursor to the Peloponnesian War to do a favor for his girlfriend. That's a constituency. Is there a system before we finish up here that you think, you know, taxpayers and military are getting their monies worth. I mean, the first one that comes to mind to me anyway is, you know, the Warthog, the A10, but I just saw in Pogo last month. This I'll just read a little, but they're looking at for the first time in a decade. Congress is not blocking Air Force plans to retire some of its A10s. So they're finally the I mean, and this grand bargain. It's like, okay, now let's cut the one thing that damn it won't go obsolete on its own. Like these beautiful A1 B1s and B2s, which know when it's time up. So besides the Warthog, is there anything out there that anything else? I mean, you've written about the striker, the Kevlar coffin, which we're sending like a hundred of those. Do you crane? I mean, it's, it's hard to think of one. I mean, you know, things do work. Like they were talking about F16s are already the next game changer. I don't know if you've ever seen that. No, yeah, 60-way. 30 on Jack is the next game changer. Which is less good of playing than it was that years ago was designed. Going back to the A10 for a second, when you talk to Democrats, I've ever talked to Democratic congressman about how, you know, how can you cut this? So these would be left, you know, and they say, well, if even the Pentagon wants to get rid of the weapon. Yes. It's like the last people you should listen to. Yeah, it's incredible. I mean, in 8,000 sorties, real combat sorties against in Afghanistan, people that we supplied ourselves with stingers. Only five A10s have been shot down five out of 8,000 combat sorties. Yeah. But, okay. So we'll go. I mean, General James Post once called any support for the A10 treason. He did. He did. He did. He could never, I mean, these people, they're not any sort of lunatics that are all of the same. Incredibly, like there was a guy that was a guy back Zeke Zoffler. It was an air force, had a air force acquisition in the 1970s or 60s, sorry, who declared the inefficiency as national policy. When someone said, why are you, why are you building this religious and, you know, a lot of crap that's going to take years to give you know, that inefficiency as national policy. Wow. Wow. We're going to outdo the Soviets at that too. Yes. Yes. That's the thing. Actually, reading this, Mr. Jones's CSIS report, I was actually thinking about that report on, you know, the Soviet, well bankrupted the Soviet Union. I thought, oh, we really are headed the same way. Oh, yeah. When I read your article about that, I tried to find stats on percentage of GDP. And the US is now devoting, I think, 3.7% to defense and China something like 1.7%. Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. It doesn't seem likely. I think there are moves. I think some various people are younger, Yahoo's in Congress are calling for it to be written into law. That we have to spend 4% of GDP or GDP on defense. I mean, it's a ludicrous yardstick anyway. I mean, you mean every time, say you open the new McDonald's, well, that adds to the GDP. So, therefore, the percentage of the Fed, we're spending on the Fed goes down. Whereas if we have a thorough growing, you know, depression, then the defense, you know, will be better armed for the percentage of people. And there's a lot of stick ups of McDonald's, you know, you've got to have a machine gun in that drive-through. You may close air support on that. I don't know if you saw this. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis released, this is so unbelievable they did this. And it's kind of weird the Fed would be involved. They released this graph to talk about, it basically is designed to demonstrate the China threat, China spending threat and to downplay, basically, the show that our spending actually is perilously low. And so, it's a graph. And the X-axis, of course, is time. So, 92 to 2022. And there are two Y-axis. One Y-axis on the right that, you know, goes up is, it starts at 400 billion and goes up to a trillion. And the American line on that graph goes along that. So, it measures from 400 to one trillion. But there is another Y-axis on the other side, which goes from zero to 250 billion. And to show that China spending is actually going higher. So, there are two lines. The China line, red and the US line and blue are on the same graph. But the blue line, you know, so the blue line actually trends lower because it's going not as fast towards a trillion dollars. And the China line is straight up because it's going fast from like 40 billion to 200 billion. And it looks like China is outspending us. Oh, forget it. I get it. I get it. It is the funniest thing. And it's from the St. Louis Fed. And people called it out like, how dumb do you think we are? Like, this is insane. Well, pretty dumb. I mean, like I said, I frequent comment sections. And you would be amazed how many F-35 stories get a single comment over and over, which is freedom isn't free. I mean, it sure isn't freedom. Yeah, debate stopper. Yeah. Sometimes the comment section and like serious papers like the Wall Street Journal can be interesting. But otherwise, I just get depressed. Yes. Yeah. It is like freedom isn't free. Yeah. We like getting depressed here at this show. That's very weird. It's national policy. Human democracy. Yes. It is national policy. All right. Well, we've we've kept Andrew a long time. I know. Thank you so much. Andrew for coming on. It is fun. As always, talking with you. Andrew Coburn, the Washington editor for Harper's magazine. Check out his always entertaining and sometimes in raging even a substack, which is Spoils of War, which is a spin off of his excellent book, Spoils of War. Anyway, thank you again, Andrew, for coming on the show and taking the time to talk with us. Oh, you're totally welcome. Thank you, Andrew. Thanks, Andrew. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Yeah. Yeah. There will be a radio war nerd meetup on February 7th at 7 p.m. So, you know, we're going to talk about the first thing that we're going to talk about is the LL road. One well road. And the post code is NW3, one LJ NW3, one LJ. And the post code is important because this is a giant city and the post code tells you which part of this is like most people know what that means. Yeah. I assume right. Yeah. Oh, yeah. NW3, one LJ is notorious. Oh, yeah. I won't get into it. Yeah. Yeah. And you get there on the hamstead underground or the hamstead heath overground. All right. So, um, John, any last thoughts on the budget and all of that? I mean, I love talking to Andrew. So that was just the pleasure as it was. Yeah. Well, I want to add a little caveat to the, uh, often vote cliche that freedom isn't free. Freedom isn't free. And it isn't a Bucco 9 either. Yeah. If the F 35 is freedom isn't free, it's about $250 million per lousy plane. I mean, I wonder if Lockheed is actually paying a strategic communications company to pay, you know, online trolls hired in like the Philippines is where they can pay them two bucks an hour to troll comments sections anywhere for any bad comments about the F 35 and then just to write in freedom isn't free. I mean, I would like to believe that that's what's happening. But you and I know damn well that there are more, yeah, that's homegrown stuff. There are people that get pleasure from that. Yeah. Yeah. The only people who don't believe that, and they're quite numerous. Are the people who have done a brain wipe on their high school experiences? I mean, if you went through high school pee, you know damn well who's saying freedom isn't free. And putting it there, knowing it's going to piss off a lot of people, but they can't really say anything about it because that is a a debate stopper in that faction of the comment section. Yep. Anyway, lovely country, John, you're missing on a lot here. I'm trying to. All right. Thanks again, everyone. Thanks, John. Thanks. You sure next. OK, bye. Bye. You",
