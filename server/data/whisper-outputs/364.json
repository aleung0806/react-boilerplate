    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. Today is January 30th, 2023. This is episode 364. Radio Warner, which you can find at Patreon, where you can subscribe for the newsletters. Patreon forward slash Radio Warner. Anyway, I'm the coast, Mark Ames here in Rochester, Western New York, and I am online with John D.A.K.A, Gary Breacher, A.K.A.V. Warner in Carthage, or just outside Carthage. A ways from Carthage, a town called Hamamette, which is right on the coast south of Carthage. But we did visit Carthage in an official Radio Warner field trip by Taxi. And I just want to give people... Did you fly the Radio Warner flag on your way there so that people knew? In spirit, but the taxi driver wouldn't have gone for any literal flagging. But it was a pretty remarkable trip. I mean, for one thing, Tunisia is a really pleasant surprise. I didn't know it got cold in North Africa. Call me dumb, but it gets darn cold here. Yeah, it looked it up. You guys are in the 40s and 50s. I mean, it's like winter in Northern California kind of thing, right? Yeah. And one of the reasons we came here is because there's a pool, and I need to re-awake in some muscles in my... What used to be my left arm, because it sort of got atrophied after I smashed the bones in it. So we have forced ourselves to swim. Catherine's gone in with me to the astonishment of the hotel staff. And it's really working. It's been great. And it's true what they say. After the first minute or so, you don't mind it so much. It doesn't feel so cold. Right. That first minute is quite remarkable, though. But anyway, we visited Carthage, and all I can say at Mark, you'll know about why I'm saying this. Read Salambo. Read Salambo. Yes. Slow Bear got it right. I don't know how. And I don't think it's a kind of show your work thing. He just got it right intuitively in the way that Plato said poets do. It's a remarkable sight and kind of sad in a way. And yet, thanks to Salambo, I didn't start feeling sorry for the... Carthage, because they're pretty horrible. Yeah, they give the Romans a run for their money and horrible stuff. Yeah, I know. Yeah, it's sort of bad versus bad and maybe versus worth. But it is one of the most beautiful sites I've ever seen. We were on the hill of Bersta, where some of the main temples were... You know, the typical of an ancient city, the Temple Hill, like the Acropolis, was also a last ditch, keep or fortress. And the Romans had a real vengeance on Carthage. They didn't just destroy it. They destroyed everything they could, including the text, so that there's not much material. I've been looking for material. And I think, you know, really, Flobar's guess was as good as anybody's. And in fact, better because he had the sensibility for it. But there is this wondrous feeling that this must have been a miraculous place when the sun was shining on the sea, which surrounds the city in every direction. And it was a strange place. That's one thing you can be sure of, that Carthage and the Punic cities in general, like Tyre and Lebanon, which was the parent city of the Carthaginian colony, they were strange. And they divided up city by city, unlike Rome, which imposed a very strong central authority on everything. The Carthaginians, the other Punic colonies, became strange in their own ways. But it's all gone now. A lot of the ruins on the top of this hill are actually medieval because Louis IX was involved in launching one of his crusades from there. It did not go well, which led to him becoming Saint Louis. But I don't know how much... Name of a lot of schools. I don't know if it's the same Louis, but they're a lot of private schools name. They're a lot of Saint Louis because the French church got involved with the state in a familiar way. I don't want to idealize Tunisia too much, but last night we saw some guy on a scooter zoom out of a side street and slam right into the side of a car. And it was his fault. There's no doubt. And it was so weekend night and maybe he was drinking. What I noticed particularly was this young male response. Because many times when I was young, I'm sure it's happened to you too. What you fear most is embarrassment. So at the moment you're in shock, you wake up on the ground. And the first thing you want to do is get up. So nobody laughs at you. You got to get up and I did that once when I was young and I fainted dead away. But this guy got up and he was yelling to the car. But you could tell his, his vestpo was wrecked. He probably... He's going to feel it 20 years from now. And it was a reminder that unemployment is running really, really high here, especially since the tourist industry cratered after the beach and museum attacks a few years ago. That museum, Borsa Museum is still closed, in fact, and never really opened it up again. So the country is in really bad shape, but the people who are extraordinarily polite, courteous and reserved in a dignified way. Plus it's cold. How often do you get real cold anymore? I know, that's cool. Cold but not snowy, but like I said, more like West Coast cold. Yeah, that's cool. Whereas WC Field said you can freeze to death under a rose bush and full bloom. He was speaking seriously and metaphorically. Yeah, it works both ways. Yeah. All right, well let's get to... Anyway, first of all, it sounds like fun. And I'm going to say this again, I think a couple of people sort of you know, give an approval to it. We do have to do Punic Wars at some point. I mean, it is pretty amazing. Or even Salambo or, you know, some version of that because that's some pretty amazing stuff in Hannibal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's a scene of Hamel Car dedicating the child Hannibal to eternal vengeance on Rome. Not always spoke to me like, oh yeah. Just whatever you do, never mind if it's miserable or failed, just get the wrongs. All right, so speaking of Vespas hitting armored vehicles, this is my segue. We have a swan of sex. Isn't that? That's why I'm a pro. Yeah. We are excited to have with us today. John Griffiths, he is the host of Totally Tanks, the Totally Tanks podcast, which has gotten a lot of play in the Radio Warner Facebook page. And as you can tell by the title of the podcast, it is a podcast about tanks. And, you know, what Warner has not gone through or is still going through their tank nerd phase. Anyway, first of all, thank you for joining the show and welcome, John. John G. Thank you very much. It's an absolute pleasure to be with you. I've been a subscriber since episode one. So, I'll get on the show as a big wrap. Wow. Wow. Great. We should mention that John G woke up at 5 a.m. Yes. Beyond the show because he's in Canberra, I think. Canberra's strategy, correct? Yeah, that's very military of you to get up at 5 a.m. for the show. Actually, set the alarm at 4 to make sure it's time to come to the coffee. But here we are. It's all correct. And for once, we're going to give hardware people all the hardware they can handle. Yes. Roll right over them. It's time to count the rivets. John made a bunch of great notes. And I don't know. I'm kind of thinking of this. Like, let's not assume everybody already knows so much. I mean, I don't know. I'd like to hear the story. Even briefly, if you can even just give even a two-minute summary, whatever, a brief history of tanks. I mean, obviously, what we're going to get to are the tanks in the Ukraine war. That's tanks have made a big comeback in that war. But there's a lot we don't. Not getting or getting wrong. So, there's a lot to talk about there. But I just think before we get there, maybe a brief, brief history of tanks, and then we'll sort of talk, do a little brief taxonomy of different armored, wheeled vehicles as well. If that's all right with you. Absolutely. So, we're going to start. We've got to go back to the chariots. I mean, I'm kind of joking there because fundamentally, what makes the tank is mobility protection and firepower. And you go back to the chariots and that essentially was providing all of those things, although mobility had some issues as John's, Donald Allen's noted. Oh, I was right. I was just doing a dumb guess there. Well, anytime people are in conflict, the need to protect units and have them be able to move on the battlefield and inflict damage. That's always been a combination that's been sought after. But chariots were great for early technicaler movies. Let's be honest. I mean, you put Chuck Eston in one and you got a flick. Well, once you've lived in Mesopotamia, it's a totally flat mud-clined flood plan. Sure. And for being able to just be able to move up and down roads, even can be all you actually need, which we'll get to with some of the more modern vehicles. You get to the birth of the tank formally, in 1916 at the Battle of the Sun when they threw them in early, just because the battlefield had become so intense and artillery barragels and strapping on you, you've got essentially steel rain. And if you can't keep the rain off, you're dead. And many ways the war in Ukraine at the moment is reaching a similar status where nothing can move on the battlefield or survive without being significantly protected. And that's why they're calling for armored vehicles now there. So, you know, the tank, not particularly auspicious, they burned in 1916, they mostly all broke down and got destroyed, which is an important point that even from its first day, the tank has not been an insoluble problem to the enemy. It's just a problem that has to be solved. So tanks have always been able to be destroyed and they can definitely still be destroyed. But that's sort of the birth of it. And then in World War II, obviously, they became incredibly important. And the fall of France, but everyone thinking about how to use tanks more and more and more of their Soviets were very much ahead of the field on that one. It's hard to understand just how significant Russia's been in tank development throughout its history. That's really interesting. I'm sorry to stop here for a second, because that's just, you know, okay, just speaking sort of in the war nerd kind of American or maybe Western, I don't know, point of view, everyone was mostly obsessed with, you either were really obsessed with sort of, allied meaning Anglo and American tanks or the German panzers. And that's all anybody drew on their binders and sort of obsessed about. And the T-34s, the Russian tanks, it was sort of, they just didn't get talked about that much. I mean, certainly not as technological or more advanced. It was more like, well, it was more like a horde, you know, the idea was, well, they can win in a horde, but you know, those German tanks are so much better. It was always that the Germans were technologically advanced, but you know, you're saying that the Russians have always been pretty advanced and take technology. Briefly, let's touch on the T-34, because it is such an important tank and it does feed into modern Russian tank design. In the T-34, you had a 76 millimeter gun in the late 1930s, you had a 550 horsepower aluminium block diesel engine. You know, these are things that the rest of the world wasn't catching up to until the 1943. Now, the T-34 definitely had a whole bunch of other problems, mostly due to Russian production. And also, they were using underwater welding, which was something that the West didn't even realize was a thing until years later. What do you mean with underwater welding? When you form a welding on a factory floor, you've always got a problem that you've got hot modern steel on this oxygen in the atmosphere, all getting into it. And if you can do your jigs and run your arc weld underwater, then you can get some improvements in your metallurgy. This also comes into development of tanks that people realizing the welded tank hulls were a much better idea than bulging them together with rivets, which the British were doing into 1944 or hand beyond. Because to try not to get too bogged down, the problem with riveted armour, and you've got, sure you've seen older tanks, particularly from the 1930s, with the looks like they got acne, they got fossil open, and they're good to go. Yeah, yeah. When the tank gets hit by something unpleasant, the rivets all share and the inside of the tanks filled with pieces of hypersonic rivet. So tank rivets do not like riveted tanks at all. Oh, God. Pulling it out of your chest. Yeah. It's a good rivet. If you have actually the World War I tanks, they literally had little chainmail veils for the crews to look at the isolates with because the incoming machine gun fire that was literally lead flowing through the isolates. So, yeah, if you go to a lot of War Museums have them because this test drive here looks like catafracts or something with these chainmail veils. Right. Wow. Yeah, those World War I tanks, they got to say, I mean, I don't want to talk about the machine now, but they're incredible. I mean, you stood up in them like all these people standing up with these different guns pointing in different directions. They're in sage crews. 12 people inside. And an exposed engine in the body of the tank. So if anyone loses their feet and puts their hand down, that's a third degree burn straight off the back. And the fumes and I mean, the things were, the things were terrible except for marching forward on foot across the planes of France, which was worse. And then the T-34 enjoyed some great days after World War II. Like I remember as a kid, I mean, one of the few times you really did get an appreciation for Soviet tank technology was when you read about the first American battle of the Korean War task force Smith, as it was called firing these recoilless rifles at the T-34s. And it was sort of like firing a handgun at the terminator. It was just like the thing just keeps coming. Yeah, you needed a solid weapon to take out a T-34, which the Germans obviously discovered somewhat to their horror while they were enjoying Barbarossa. But they were these, just between the T-34 and then the KV-1 series tanks, which became the IS, Joseph Stalin series later. The KVs were enormously heavily armored and there were stories of these things being just totally surrounded and firing away for days. And so the Germans, certainly folks like Guderian were writing, even as Barbarossa was happening, that hang on, we're outflanking the Russians and they're in terrible disarray, so we're making huge progress. But we can't actually destroy these tanks. And this is going to be a problem down the road. And when everyone fetishizes the German heavy and super heavy tanks of the Russian IS-2, with a 122 millimeter gun that was immune from the front to the German 88s, really should have a lot more fandom. I know that Peter Samson of the Tank Archive has got a new book out on the IS-2 that I haven't read it myself yet, but knowing him, I would recommend it if you're interested, because that is a tank produced in numbers. And it was in occasion huge battles in the late war, where it was wiping out King Tigers and Panthers with great abandon. So yeah, really interesting. So we can check that up to the Cold War. I mean, it's getting quite a score as we go back through 20th century history. And now it's malign, influence is felt even in the most hardwareish of military history then. Very much. The important point to take from the T34 though is that this guy, Constantan, Cell Pan, in Ukraine in the 1930s of the Karkiv train factory, came up with this aluminium block, diesel engine that would throw out 550 horsepower. That engine with some modifications would keep pairing all Russian armor into the start of the T90 series. Wow. So that's until recently, basically, because the T90 is the 1990s, I think, right? That's correct. Yeah, that's pretty much the most modern field tank the Russians have. Midway through the T90 run, they did move over to a different engine. So it's, we can't say it's still in the present day, but it had an enormously long run. It was just an incredible shame he got perched in the late 30s, because to think what he could have done with wartime priority onto his projects, it would have been something pretty exciting. For reference, the US in World War II didn't feel an engine with more than 500 horsepower. And thanks to Cell Pan's and the Karkiv train factory, they had an engine at the start of the war that was 50 horsepower. More power. And they shot him. He was killed. Yeah, he was killed. So much of his apology and rehabilitation later, but yeah, it didn't do. We're sorry. But so much for the theory that, because there is a theory, which maybe has some truth to it, but obviously very, very qualified. Some that, you know, the people who were shot were a lot of old Bolsheviks who were, you know, coming up the works. And so there's a lot of bunch of junior officers, fresh new energy to come up, but obviously, it took down a lot of talent to, probably mostly, a lot of talent. I'm talking about Stalin's terror. But anyway, yeah, okay, so moving forward, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but two of the big workhorse tanks in the war, at least as it started last year, the T64, which is pretty old, but still a workhorse and the T72, more T64s on the Ukraine side, more T72s on the Russian side, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, this is another little fascinating twist. Basically, the T64 program was meant to deliver a high-end Russian tank in the late 50s, 60s. And it was the final tank of the legendary guy, A.A. Morozov, who had been involved way back in the T34 project. Maybe not doing such great work on the first one. The T34-85, the late war improvement was very much his, the T55, you know, the most mass produced tank in history, the 54-55, that was a Morozov tank. And then as he was approaching retirement, he wanted to make this sort of, his, his, gonna be his last symphony, this amazing tank, bring all the most advanced concepts together. And that created the T64, which at the time was largely considered a failure. The reason Ukraine's got so many is that they couldn't afford to move them very far away from the factory because they have to go back for repairs. The T64 was a carcass product, right? Yeah, coming out of the carcass factory and the result of it's very bad reliability when it was introduced was that they couldn't move it too far away from the factory because they had to keep going back for repairs. And that comes down to it, had a very advanced, what they called a post piston engine, where the pistons meet in the middle of the cylinders, which let it be a multi-fuel engine and very low flat ones, create a low flat tank. But it was ahead of its time, especially for training, field mechanics in an army. So that's why the Ukraine's have T64s. It's mostly matured into a much better tank. But what the Russians, the Soviets did with the failing T64 program was grab the bits of work, shove it into pretty much a trigon-true design from the past and voila, you've got a T72. And then, not the only ones that happens to something quite similar happens to the British with Challenger, not that far away in time, where their projects all fail and they grab the bits of work and make less advance tank that actually becomes brilliant. So that's the origin of the T72 still rumbling away with its T34 engine in the back. Right. So this tank genius's swan song, Final Goodbye, was a flop, but ultimately wound up being retooled and either made viable as a T64 today, or its DNA was taken out and injected in the T72. Yeah, the T64, the Ukrainians using, seems to be going as a pretty solid tank these days. It was just in the 1960s work quite ready for it. Right. I remember when I was a very naive tank fancier in a very aesthetic way. The Russian tanks, and I've heard they had a height limit, like you couldn't be over 5, 7 or something. And they looked it, you know, they looked really compact, low to the ground, hard to hit, with a giant gun and no room for anything else. Absolutely. Yeah, something that's a little appreciated is, we're talking about these western tanks to be sent to Ukraine. They're all in the high 70s at Gaming Gate, 80-10 range, whereas Russian MBTs tend to be in the 40 to 50-10 range. Well, so in some cases it's almost half the weight. And when you're trying to put tactical bridging units forward to cross-ribbers, every extra ton is a lot. So the Russians, they took out the loader, replaced with the auto loader, we definitely have to talk more about all the loaders. But they made their tanks incredibly flat. They call it the Frypan turret that's pretty much ubiquitous from the 1950s to the day. And a colossal gun, 125 millimeter gun, the biggest tank gun currently in use in the West is 120 millimeters. And one thing with tank guns is every time you add a millimeter to that headline number, the whole thing scales. The most extreme example would be in World War II, the American 75 millimeter next to 76, the 76 is twice the length, one millimeter length, that much difference is the other. So the Russians with their 125s for quite a while now, that is a significantly big gun. Let's talk about bridging here, because as far as I know, no bridging units are going with going to Ukraine with these tanks, but this is a well-watered flat country, lots of rivers. They do supposedly have an amphibious capacity, both I think the Abrams and the leopard too. How well does it work? It's not as mature and heavily used as the Soviet weighting capacities. Generally, you think about it the first blush, weighting your tank with a snorkel underwater with zero visibility of your own, and God knows what's at the bottom of the river seems like a quick way to be tired of life. Certainly, in Soviet doctrine, when they had a bridge crossing going over a river, they had engineer and underwater pathway, and run that as a second stream with their weighting vehicles, so they weren't taking up bridge capacity. That still requires quite a leap of faith as your tank lurches into the brown, and you just keep the engine running, and hope you come out the other side. I wouldn't want to do it myself. Yeah, you quite rarely see tanks weighting in combat conditions, and partly, they're running around with a snorkel on a battlefield with straitmal going everywhere, and the snorkel is just sitting out on the back of the tank. Would you want to trust your life to the structural integrity of that after a couple of days out there? We're going to want to get to the leopard and the Abrams and the challenger, but let's first finish up with a few of these things here because most of the battle, anyway, so the T-72s, there are also some T90s and even a couple of T14s. What's the T90 and the T14? And I guess the T80 is that mostly export? I don't know. There's been a few T80s on the battle field in Ukraine. That was another attempt at a high-end tank, and they went with a turbine engine because the Americans had done that with the Abrams, and famously in Grozny, they all ran out of fuel at the same time. There are T80s around, a lot of ways the system is similar to the T-72, as built a bit more advanced. The T90 is in many ways a T-72 with some Western upgrades, particularly there was a French targeting system that Russia wasn't supposed to get that somehow turned up in enormous numbers. Questions are still being asked about that one. That's a problem for the Russians now in that the availability of those upgrade parts for new build T90s aren't there. As the war goes on, and we've seen all the pictures of them pulling tanks out of, what's euphemistically called storage, but just looks like pets to most people. They put a lot of very old tanks like T-62s out there, but the capacity to build more T90s if they can convince the Indians to get off their production lines because India makes up most of the T90 market in the world much more so than Russia. That's a lot of interesting negotiations happening there, but T90 is essentially an upgraded T-72, they're very much the same tank. I would big thing to note with the T-72 is while it lacks sophistication and it is built around this ammunition carousel that is quite dangerous, although most other tanks share that weakness in one way or another. The engine is so- Can you explain ammunition carousel? Yes, absolutely, so to make the auto load of work in the Russian T-64 had a something similar bit different. You've got a carousel like a cartridge, like an old Tommy gun basically of shells in the bottom of the tank turret and that rotates around and drives a new ammunition into the gun as needed, which takes out the need to have a gunner in the tank which lets you build the tank much smaller. Right, they were very proud of getting down to a 3-man crew in the T-64 and T-72. Yes, it's a bigger bounce and the Americans are really starting to look at it now. Seriously, it was a long way ahead and the French also did a lot of stuff with the auto loaders around the same time. It does have some disadvantages but fundamentally a guy who's just there to put shells in the gun if you can automate that then that's probably a good thing. Yeah, but you've got this carousel of ammunition at the bottom of the turret and what's turning out to the surprise of very few is the most dangerous thing in the tank, the most likely thing to cause a catastrophic explosion is its own ammunition. You look at the number of losses of battleships. It's almost always its own ammunition being cooked off. So this is a problem and I think in future tank designs we will see finally and move away from storing ammunition in the turret. At the moment only the American Abrams fully partitions its ammunition from Scrooge. Everyone else's tanks have got some ammunition storage in the crew compartment. So quick questions. So you mean if when the ammunition goes off kind of like by its own or I guess more obviously it's that they get hit in the turret. So you want to aim for the turret and that sets off the chain reaction or Well, so when the tank gets hit somewhere and particularly with all these guided missiles and sci-fi and anti-tank weapons they're using shaped charges, which if you're anyone wants to know about those and doesn't already the slow-mo guys on YouTube they're shaped just a set for slow-mo guys, shape-charge. They're doing in hyper slow-motion what essentially weapons testers have done for decades and you can actually see how these shape-chargers work and it's quite an eye opener. But it's basically creating a pencil thin jet that penetrates the armour and that's not actually that dangerous in the tank unless it hits something that explodes. Yeah, okay. Obviously a very bad day when this jet burst into your tank and if you're in the way you're going to take a severely bad injury but not necessarily fatal and not necessarily fatal for everyone. But if it hits some ammunition stored in the tank then you'll yeah everyone's dead very quickly. That would explain why you see so many pictures of blown-up tanks were the turret. I mean I remember seeing this in Skynvali in South Ossetia when I was there you'd see like all the tank in one place and then the turret like 30 yards away or something. That's it particularly with this carousel and this is something that the Javelin and the Enlaw are particularly targeting with the top attack. So it comes in the top and they know already that there's this huge platinum of ammunition laid out and coming in from the top it becomes almost as certainty that the jet scanner intercepts one of those. Right. Right. Okay. All right this and I don't know is the T-14 worth even mentioning yet? I don't view the T-14 as a real tank yet it's really a technology demonstrator and a front-top at this point. If any do get to Ukraine it'll be very interesting to see how they go but it's not going to change the battlefield that much. Although you can make the same argument about British challenges. Yeah. So maybe we should talk about the numbers and what the influence of these imports of leopard 2s and Abrams will actually do. Like how many tanks is Ukraine fielding now? How many operational tanks do they have versus how many Russian tanks? I don't have any numbers I trust on how many are left operational and not. It's hard to find. Yeah. Yeah. I would say you know the start of the war the Ukrainians had around a thousand. Sorry I'm speaking off the top of my head there and the Russians had maybe three times as much. They both destroyed a lot. Certainly when the big breakout around KKV happened like last year there were media reports of armored fists of eight tanks which suggest two exhausted sides where even around with small concentration of army could be quite interesting. Yeah. Yeah. And both sides are largely using their armor as well. You know the the purists would call salt guns not tanks which is really the same thing trust me. Where it just runs forward with the infantry. Something shoots at them and then they eliminate what's shooting at them and then they keep rumbling forward but they they're staying in close contact with the infantry which is you know some people would call that good combiner arms rather than speaking derives orally about a salt guns. Right. It's more that well I'm I as an amateur watcher was tempted to speak derisively about a tank rumbling into town with no infantry screen and that was when the javelin seemed to come into its own although it seems to have been dealt with is is that right. I don't think the Russians are doing too many armored thrusts at the moment that are amenable to that sort of countering. You know I mean the start of the war if it had worked we would have called it a brilliant use of blitzkrieg but it didn't work so we were everyone's making fun of it but when the Russians are charging huge streams of vehicles down highways yeah you're really amenable and any faster vans is going to you're not going to be able to clear every headdrow so it's always a gamble you take. Yeah I mean I think implicit in that gamble was and they're not going to really know how to fight or they're going to be so shocked and odd that they won't even get their act together in time and that obviously didn't happen but anyway so let's get back to the story so yeah can you tell us a bit about the leopard twos and maybe the abrums and the challengers and then I think we'll get into some of the the way that the tank and armored well we'll probably have to talk about other armored vehicles and then we'll talk about how the war has sort of changed but first let's let's talk about these new western tanks which are the new game changers or not you know yeah look my read of the sources and I just want to quickly stress I have no class of firedecks is whatsoever yeah is that they're not talking about these the German or American tanks getting to Ukraine realistically before the end of this year or even next year it's a it's a leopard also yeah and the reason is of course none of this is about helping Ukraine this is about helping KMW and general dynamics so they're going for new builds they're not opening up any strategic reserves transferring in from line units so they have to wait until they build wow okay so it's fantastic for the companies they've got new orders Ukraine's sitting there without tanks so don't really get too excited about that and I could be wrong with those timelines but that's what journalists are writing about in in publication so let's go with that I'd heard that about the Abrams at the Abrams I mean the Washington Post just came out and basically you know it's the Langley Post I mean they basically came out and leaked to the paper the Abrams were only there to give cover for the leopards like you know the Abrams man they aren't going in there they're just there for show that is to say they're not even going to go in for show probably but they're there so that sholts can say hey the Americans are doing it that's at least the PR about it but I didn't realize I thought I thought um well let's talk about the leopard too because that seems to have been a very sought after successful export tank a lot of places have wanted it so what's so good about or is it that good uh firstly the Germans are more relaxed about who they sell to than the Americans the other one is it was built for export the Abrams certainly the Abrams that Ukraine's going to get are what they call FMS versions which is foreign military sales which as I'm sure you've heard about export versions before means no one has good those are what the Saudis have in Yemen but yeah and particularly the the armor scheme isn't as good and doesn't have a depleted uranium in it and realistically no one's going to send their best most advanced tank to Ukraine to get destroyed on television and then torn apart by the Russians so well we did it with the F117 in Serbia yeah no it's a little bit anyway yeah certainly it's not a favorite option yeah the really interesting thing to Douglas slightly is the British sending challenger to at this point that screams to me that their challenger threes are using a totally different armor scheme if they're willing to expose challenger to his armor to this scrutiny but the the theory that I've heard and that I like but is just a theory and has nothing to back it up whatsoever is that the main thing the Germans were hanging on thought is they do not want a whole heap of lepids skate of Ukraine and being of a lot the nightly news blown up yes so I was going to say it's bad for and bad for export marketing right yeah you don't want them in a place where they can get blown up you want them just to you know where people have I don't know small arms or something and that's it yeah let's see I guess it was the dream man yeah okay might on horseback fighting peasants that's yeah yeah but so that's why they wanted the Americans to also be putting emons into Ukraine so that they were exposed to the same risk and right they could say hey you know both sides versus just blown up lepids and then they will go off on the the next generation of tank sales so lepid is lepid 2 has been incredibly successful partly because it's very modular and the customers are able to choose what they want partly because the Germans have set up translations of all the manuals yeah it was built from the ground up for that sort of export sales whereas you know you know what it's like for Americans or any anglophone really you know we just shout louder at people and think they'll think about it and learn English I found myself doing that in a taxi I don't want to talk about it sure but so it's just a mindset in American military exports that everyone will learn English versus having new translate materials and that's no small thing when you're sending you know hundreds of tanks to be driven by 19-year-olds who couldn't get out of national service right yeah yeah so that's part of the success of lepid partly the availability but lots and lots of countries have chosen it now is the armour as good as Abrams someone suggests maybe not as good it certainly seems to be good enough for most users definitely many have been destroyed but that's the nature of sending tanks to Hamas what right how much how much do these little gradations I mean I know we all at least at one time did this like you know the guys from stripes at the end like you know we test the new Russian tanks does it matter much whether you're in a T-72 because I know Schwartzkopf is supposed to have said if we'd switch tank fleets we'd still have won right that our tanks would still have won because our tank crews were better trained and so it's not the tanks so much as the tank crew yeah I think S-Appear already helped there too but yeah it's it's really hard to say what you can say from battle testing is the challenge of tanks are very heavily armoured and more so than just probably anyone else but they also are heavier than everyone else so again how the Ukrainians are going to go getting those across bridges particularly all of their engineering teams are going to be built around Russian T-series tanks each year in a 30 40 tons lighter you know that's a that's a lot of difference here every time is exponential when you're dealing with road wear and damage to machinery and just difficulty of maintenance so that's that's going to be a big problem for them we've also got a really touch on this incredible grab bag of vehicles Ukrainians trying to operate now that is not something anyone would choose and I'm certainly Australia sending it's bushmasters and things like that I mean what are you going to do with 12 bushmasters they seem to like them but in terms of keeping parts and supplies and training and annuals in Ukrainian that's going to be hugely problematic and if you're a quarter master being told I'll send one of your vehicles to the war zone it's not going to be the best one it's going to be the one that's been at the back of the the shop for a while so there's the hanger queens the air that the hangers are getting disposed of at the moment and if it's only eight or last six weeks I guess that's fine that's kind of you know getting back to development production philosophies in World War II as well but the challenger is the heavyweight champion I mean there was a case in Iraq where one got lost a track and was hit by 72 RPGs by insurgents and when they finally recovered and opened the hatches the crew was still inside and fine a bit deaf it would have been a really long day in the off yeah yeah waiting to hear what was being brought up next but I you know dare I say you've got to think that the fact that the British still sends children and families that matter to war in tanks might have something to do with why they have the best protected tank in the history it really is extraordinary that the number of British tank officers with hyphenated last names is extraordinary and often one of the hyphenated last name sounds norm in front you know fast and use lighter the norm in French still hold the economic car grand in Britain yeah that's funny but so so among those tanks it's I mean it is the heavyweight it could take a lot of shots and if it hits you but so why was it called obsolete I mean to me I kind of think like okay so the challenger is among heavyweight boxers it's sort of like the butter bean of of tanks or I don't know if you guys know butter bean he was sort of like yeah okay well it I can't but it's why was it called obsolete and you know a mothball or or slated to be mothballed like four or five years ago well they've decided to they want to build challenger three and that doesn't mean the fleet's going out I would okay I'm just pure guesswork here the fact they're willing to send challenger to to Ukraine says to me that they've got in a very different direction with the next generation of armour so they don't mind if this one gets destroyed or or these are budgeting decisions it often comes down to you got to make room for the new inventory like nobody ever argued the A10 doesn't work but it's getting in the way of the budgeting therefore you know anybody who says the A10 works let's keep it is according to one Air Force General a trader that that happens all the time yeah but at some extent you've got to keep the BIE tank production line employing people who know what they're doing and the tank design bureaus need to stay and work so there if you want to maintain this capability there does come a point where you just have to build a new generation right but we have a huge advances in material sciences in the in the last 50 years it like like never before seen by humanity and some of that's going to tank armour you know they've got all these layers of different composite materials and the way that affects the enemies incoming panel traders is it's quite the complex area around the millennium you heard a lot of talk about the era of tanks is over and then I maybe a bit later roughly simultaneously Chobble-Marmer came in and that was a British innovation and then reactive armour how much difference have those innovations made look Chobble-Marmer the new generation of its known as Dorchester but it's a shorthand for Western composite armour Chobble-Marmer definitely was a huge game changer up until they figured it out tanks were moving away from being armoured altogether the the leopard one series was pretty much only proof against small arms and you know 12.7 millimetre you know 50 cal rounds that sort of thing and was not designed to stop anything bigger than that with the idea being the well if we can make it faster and carry bigger gun then that's that's better and then the Russians actually pioneered composite armour they don't get a lot of credit for that I just the Russians kind of a theme here I know the Russians well also the folks will say that concepts are relatively cheap to implement and so that was an area where the Russians tried to get ahead but they also ended up with much more varied tank fleets which is we've said carries some costs as well but the so the Russians were the first with composite armour in the field and but the British definitely went a different direction and there's something about their form of laminate that has to be straight lines which is why American and British tanks are so angular and flat flat on those angles but just because the nature of the I think they're calling it well challenge to had door chest aram but yeah trouble do you know what the elements are the composites are just as a chemistry nerd I'm just kind of curious like yeah I only confidential mark but people who have seen them when they've been burst open have described it as bags of powder and plastic bags wow interesting and we're talking metals we're talking heavy metals you know famous it pleated uranium which turns the whole with a tank gets hit turns it into a hazardous chemical site and it absorbs the shock better basically or it's atomic weight means it's harder to move aside so a layer is that in there when you're trying to disrupt what it was trying to get into your tank seems it definitely seems to work and Kaz created old model RPGs definitely do struggle to get through this stuff you know that's why they've moved to top attacks and tandem warheads and bigger charges and the whole arms race but it definitely was a huge game changer there was just this generation of steelhard tanks that around you know young couple war in 1973 everyone looked at it and said these essentially may as well not be armored at all and then they came up with this laminar armor and they said oh we can go with super heavy weight tanks that we never would have dreamed of loading our logistical system with because they've actually got some degree of protection and I'd say as big a change has been the Israeli trophy active protection system which appears to work very well and that's a real bunch of contention as to whether that's going to go on these western tanks kind of you because it's Israeli and I don't think they give permission for it and by reading between the lines no one's saying trophy which means they might be getting stuck with some crappy lock-heed knockoff but the fact that the US Army is still buying trophy says to me that it's much better than anything America has been able to come up with yet yeah this is a strange tank technology I want to ask you about we've got you here reactive armor it's sort of like you know installing a defensive claim or mine so that as the as the projectile is hitting the the armor is blasting outward yes so slightly different BCS so explosive reactive armor and that's the stuff that looks like Lego blocks on the outside of tanks are the ideas that when a round is incoming it hits the explosive reactive armor which goes kaboom and that disrupts the incoming round because they all rely on very exotic physics to get through these huge amounts of armor and and that's all quite relatively delicate so that's explosive reactive armor is and it can disrupt both kinetic penetrators which are the big lawn darts that big tank guns fire and the the chemical warheads that and should have fired any tank missiles years that's the idea obviously it doesn't work all the time it definitely works some of the time we've definitely seen tanks in Ukraine take hits and keep operating but you know also we've seen them blow the turret up then you then you got active protection systems which is basically a series of it's almost like an agioste system on ships where it's got radar pointing in all directions and when it detects an incoming anti-tank missile it fires a shotgun shell essentially at the incoming round and it's Israel's had it's made by Carver's much scarier where they're using those in the Middle East and the rest of the world's very impressive them it what does weigh five tons so it's another five tons on top of your already bulky western tanks but I've not seen anyone confirm yes that any of these vehicles going to Ukraine is going to have trophy they're they're having active protection it's going to be a not as good system right right we should say again real quickly here that talk about the geography of eastern Ukraine I mean it is a lot of that whole region it's pretty wet in spring even summer depending on the rains and definitely in the fall and so a lot of streams a lot of bugs or marshes a lot of rivers right so I mean and so a lot of bridges and so you would think that the Soviet Russian tanks the 40 ton ones are going to be a lot more kind of useful than these 60 plus ton western tanks that are coming in I don't know what do you think you would definitely think that that's going to be a huge problem it's it traits simpler problems for the Russians you know when they they're looking at a map they've got obviously the the tear weights of all the bridges in Ukraine they would have sent some guys out before the invasion pictures of that presumably it's a pretty easy thing to do you know just a backpacking family could pick that up and once you you know literally computers are already set up so the truck drivers can plot safe routes for whatever weight truck they're driving so this is all open source civilian tech to be able to plot where the the Ukrainian tanks can possibly come from that's not to say they couldn't build some pontoon bridges or some some other temporary bridging right it absorbs a lot more of that stuff than the light of tanks do and everyone's got limits in their logistic capacities so it corrects some problems for the Russians it does also but some things are easy to solve and that they can only be coming through over this bridge because it's a strong bridge to take that column right right not not the other small bridges in the area they have to take the one heavy bridge that's it and that's that that's a nervous place to be crossing that bridge because it could time to hit it with a missile bomb urban yeah I would say a plastic example of this lake world will turn the western front the perching tanks finally get sent into the war zone because was they make near was dead and yeah they got sent forward and then they hit a waterway and the sherman would go across on the available tactical bridging and the Persians would sit there sadly watching the the sherman's go ahead yeah and it happened numerous times this isn't just a hypothetical thing is the way we can point to this right the one takeaway about the leopard two abrims and challenges although they're all good tanks is that just don't expect them on the battlefield game changing anything anytime soon it's more of a psychological boost your challenges you might and my suspicion because the UK's been running this enormous training program for Ukraine and soldiers is that when the British announced the challenges were going that the training was already completely they they could start up very quickly but like we said they're a very really heavy tank Ukraine's gonna have some issues they're gonna have to keep them together just to keep the parts going in their direction they've got an orphan ammunition type that no one else uses which because they've got a rifled gun which spins the the rounders it goes out does make for they use an ammo type called high-spice of squash head or a hash which it's sort of pancakes onto the outside of what it hits and then explodes and creates you know those executive toys and utensils where you drop a ball with ball on the other side fires out that principle so whatever it hits it can hit the enormous thicknesses of concrete and spall a huge blister out the other side and and similarly tank armour and that's one of these explosive reactive armors was first designed was to counter this sort of ammunition as a very solid hard to kill vehicle that can take out enemy bunkers you could spearhead a really interesting breakout with these some time and the British would absolutely love it if someone did because you know they they they look here the next generation of export cells too right so I guess now let's talk a little bit about how tanks are being used on the battlefield I mean it's it's a largely been a pretty static war I mean especially when the ball is more in kind of Russia's court it's very slow gruesome grind and with Ukraine well I mean there's southern offensive in her son didn't really go anywhere but it did its job I mean first of all it opened up the whole heartkey area so they could just go and walk right through that and then it depleted enough Russian or in the her sonar that Russia basically had to withdraw from half of the Oblast but but aside from that it's been a fairly static war I mean this buck moot battle which is very world war oney you know it's just barely moves so how are the tanks used and are they used together with other armored vehicles of any kind of like what's what have you noticed I mean there aren't too many tank on tank battles like you know the battle of course it's not like that right but we all dream of Kirsten full the game you know we have to make do with one-on-one little catchments yeah they they have been you know we're just relying on on the videos that come out and someone's had to take that video and say let's let the world see it so it's serving someone's agenda right yeah so I get a lot of people sending me stuff all the time as you can imagine as I'm sure they do with you guys too a lot of it I take with a grain of salt I mean I look at it I'm interested but I'm wary of drawing too many conclusions at this stage I would say in general tanks are being used mostly as assault guns partly because if they go charging forward on their own yeah both sides are bristling with anti-tank weapons and they're going to be taking shots at the side and rear that they can't survive so they have to move forward with the infantry and that brings you back down to you know walking pace for most but I would note the lesser mentioned thing in this recent round of sales to Ukraine equipment is the infantry fighting vehicles are probably as important as the tanks because that at least gets your let's your infantry move up and sure IFE if it gets hit by an artillery round that's game over with the directed but it will keep trapped and allowed and keep the troops alive in these highly hostile environments we still think get a big close to the enemy one thing I noticed in late 20th century wars by say second-level powers is that tanks would move in and infantry fighting vehicles whether there were BMPs or whatever even M1-13s but they would move into prepared earth positions and then they were pretty much invulnerable and you had an armored turret that could fire in any direction and it would be awfully hard to hit yeah I mean someone needs to prepare that position for you under fire so it's it's nice work if you can get it yeah and also the new generation of top attack munitions are making that dug in hold down position right maybe slightly more important than it used to be yeah the new generation of tanks you probably you might notice if you start looking at pictures of them the turret almost completely covers the whole body of the tank and this is largely so they can get away with just having one layer of armor over the top of the tank rather than having to do them both so turrets are getting better protected and sloped and it's always an arms race but yeah at the moment the top attacks do seem to have some advantage but the infantry fighting vehicle I mean we're sending we're sending the Bradley and the Germans are sending the martyr and the striker yeah but the Bradley at least has the TOW I always pronounce it wrong is it tow or TOW? Other works for me? Yep. All right which has supposedly what 2.5 kilometer range and it's basically a tank destroyer missile so as a defensive weapon against tanks it would depend on who fire is first I suppose although the the TOW I suppose is significantly slower than a tank round yeah you talk to tank guys and they'll they'll get much more excited these days about thermal images which let them see the enemy first then they are necessarily about the size of the tank and and similarly Bradley with its thermal images is going to see tanks a long way away and and you know I mean look at the Gulf War Bradley's killed an enormous number of amount of Iraqi armor it's formidable but it's at the same time it's a higher vehicle if it takes a hit it's it's going down so it's not I try to use it Bradley as a a main fighting vehicle is is missing its main point which is the ability to get your infantry in contact with your own tanks forwarded in the south right yeah and it can deal with you know a couple shots if it comes across something nasty right so what is what are the supply issues we're talking about here with with all these various you know infantry fighting vehicles some APCs different countries tanks and you know gasoline and repairs because tanks need constant repairs don't they absolutely constant and I'm sure you know if if you're driving around northern Syria I mean we interview the guy wants to driven them T-55 stars on T-55 around northern Syria but even then they would it had to go home at night and the mechanic had to do about four hours of work a day on them and I mean that was interesting as well because they were making the ammunition forward in Sheds in Rahaba but yeah which wasn't something anyone sort of thought they could do right yeah so yes tanks need a lot of maintenance I'm interested in things like tensioning the tracks involves all the crew are rolling around in the mud and leaning on bribe hours so yeah a lot of work that stuff you know the crew is supposed to be able to level of field maintenance but the parts just some other Ukraine have mastered something really new and clever with a little Android tablets and they're using that to dispatch logistics in a way the humans could never have done before. Ah interesting yes possible because they're definitely using Amazon Amazon drone delivery kind of yeah yeah maybe that's the thing are they're just throwing stuff with the front line and running it to look at's destroyed which certainly involves a lot of this effort but does run you through equipment faster. I would say part of the small shipment of tanks that's going to be talking about right now is just seeing what Ukraine's do with them whether they can support them. Right well I mean I got to say you know people in that part of the world because they the cars were not easy in trucks and stuff for many years until like the last 20-30 years they're really good with making do like close pins in the lot uh you know in the engine block like all kinds of wire hangers and getting things working. I mean they had to learn that I don't know maybe that that skill has gone a bit in the last 20 years with all the higher quality sort of western goods but definitely when they first moved out there it was just amazing how resourceful people were dealing with what they had you know. Yeah as long as you're dealing with big old diesel engines you're probably going to be okay with with that level of you know what we'd call it bush mechanics but you've also could then got the problem with Abrams that it runs on a turbine right. Can you explain that? Can you explain what that is and why it's so difficult the you know in terms of supplies and whatever. It's basically something very similar to a jet engine sits inside the tank and it has a lot of advantages for starting it can really run on any fuel you literally run it on Chanel number five if you've got to fill it up. But it's a jet engine and that requires mechanics who are trained for jet engines not for servicing tractors whereas anyone on a Ukrainian farm who's got a tractor going can get a diesel engine tank going probably with some margin of error. Right. What about the mileage on the Abrams? That's one of the criticisms that a lot of people have had like three gallons to the mile. Is that accurate? Well look none of these tanks have great great stuff on me and you know you double the weight you're more than doubling the fuel needed to get the tank over a given distance. So that's a big deal for all of them. Definitely the original model Abrams didn't have what they call the Xerupeo unit so if you wanted to keep your thermal sight running and your tank you know seeking targets on the horizon you have to have the main engine running. Oh my god. I can send M182s I'm pretty sure that'll have the Xerupeo unit which is basically a small petrol that might be diesel engine. That runs as a generator inside the tank when you're not using the main thing and they're doing a lot with the batteries these days as well for on some of the newer tanks to not have to run the engine. But yeah turbines are thirsty and it's fine when you've got the US logistics system laying diesel or sorry jet fuel pipelines down as fast as you can advance which they did in in Iraq but Ukraine is not going to have that kind of capability. So it's going to have to be used carefully. That raises a really sensitive question like are they going to end up having to use US personnel or for that matter German personnel British personnel even if it's not officially the case. There was someone on Twitter the other day making the point where they were talking about transferring helicopters that it would literally be easier to teach the existing cruise speed Ukrainian that it would take wasn't trained up for helicopter warfare and put the you know and train them up. So yeah we're definitely reaching the point where the advisors and the trainers are going to start doing what they always do which is just saying give me that gun I'll show you how it's going. Oh come on it's such a great shot. I'll go back to advising right afterwards. Yeah right and as they're shooting the gun they'll say I want to announce here that I'm not being involved in this war I'm merely showing how to use the gun you know but because I've been denied yeah it's it's the old slippery slope thing. So and what about you know the use of drones I mean we had a guest on Samuel Bendant in the last year about drones drone warfare I mean it's pretty amazing and just how many drones are being used and I mean I would almost when you told me about you know when you were talking about like thermal imaging for example and the technological advantages that some of these western tanks would have but wouldn't they be to some degree canceled out by cheap drones. If you don't count the cheap drones absolutely. I think there are a few different approaches you can take to drones one is that if it's a full drone it's got a transmission signal as opposed to if it's completely autonomous that moves into a different territory but if it's someone with a little controller controlling a drone in their own line of sight it's emitting radio signals all the time. Right. If you've got the right equipment it's a big blowing light. You start firing proximity fused 30 millimeter ADA cannons in their direction their fragile things anything the flies has to be fragile. So there are things you know what we call a peer conflict a high intensity conflict that can be done to counter them to to some extent but they definitely do change the game. There's this no question about that. One of the things I loved was seeing that a lot of Russian tankers were using drones not to go out and find the enemy or drop grenades on them they were just planting them in the sky above their own tank so they could see what was shooting at them. That leads to another question that we wanted to ask you. There's been a lot of talk recently about a software called Kropiva in Ukrainian which I gather means nettle which will allow I mean tank guns were not originally designed to be optimal artillery. Yeah something about the the angles and I don't know. I don't know. But in the muzzle velocities. Yeah. Right okay but now supposedly you can use them in you can use this software in combination with surveillance drones not even armed drones to allow a tank to kill an enemy tank at a range up to 10 kilometers. Have you heard about this? Yeah I heard about that they're claiming the world's longest tank on tank kill which is very much annoying people in the West who care about their own records but it seems legit to a point. One thing to note is that tank man guns are designed to be incredibly high velocity for two reasons one of which is that if it's moving it took a kilometer as a second and it's going to drop you know I meet her in the first second then that makes it quite easy to just point your gun at the target and hit fire. But so that's the first reason you want the very high velocity just if it travels very flat and fast it's easy to hit the target. The other reason though is that if you try to penetrate the enemy tank you need as much energy as you can possibly get into into what you're firing. So that makes the tank guns unsuited to be our artillery for a couple of reasons. Tax throughout history have often had been fitted for and direct farther. It's not completely uncommon or unheard of. But what the Ukrainians are doing with their this nettle system certainly what they're saying we're doing everything with grain salt is that they've basically got some Android tablets with software loaded on to actors artillery fire computers for them and then they're able to with communications coordination walk their fire so you know you fire and you miss but you can see what you miss by and you move it back a bit and up a bit and you did try again and see where you're at which is a time-honored way of getting artillery on the target. So it's been artillery people have been doing that. It's better if you can fully calculate before you fire and hit first go but that's not normally a capability most folks have got. So the nettle system appears to be letting the musetanks as our artillery which isn't the worst thing in the world because they are protected. It's also not what they're ideally for but hey if you text sitting there with the front line not doing anything else and you've got spare ammunition then why not get it doing some fire missions. Where have you seen the tanks being most effective and where not I mean like I've seen various videos of some of these open field maneuvers and they're at least the ones I've seen they generally look pretty disastrous but it but they seem to be really useful and more close-up stuff. I can't write I don't know sometimes. Yeah we text. Tech commanders don't like getting close to anything. I know I know but they don't have a lot of choices either. Definitely some of the stuff you've seen in the media of these Ukrainian sirg rushes you know they if they don't work then you start saying they're human wave tactics and the commander is a butcher when they do work everyone's a genius which is you know part of the nature of the game but yeah I mean the tanks essentially give their crew a better chance of crossing that open space and closing with the enemy and finding the enemy and then eliminating them. It doesn't give you a perfect chance it gives you a better chance and for all that you know there's a reason why people literally have nightmares about being cooked alive in tanks growing up. The casualty rates in tank calls are generally significantly less than infantry it's still a better deal than they having your unprotected skin slogging across open ground. Right I guess you just feel wrongly it's sort of like flying versus riding a motorcycle. You feel wrongly like you're not in fully in control whereas if you're on the ground you're like I am the protagonist of a sci-fi novel I won't be taken down you know then yeah but that's it. Can we talk briefly about anti-tank weaponry and what has been useful I mean the javelin was the hero of the first sort of month month and a half of the war though you don't hear much about it anymore. You look at the numbers ship to your crane and you look at the number of tanks even the Ukrainians are claiming destroyed and and let's remember for every tank any army in history is claimed destroyed there's one tank that was parked on a hill that everyone's taken a shot at going past and that's claimed as 50 kills right. That's not a criticism of Ukraine that's everyone. No that's more. But you know even taking the Ukrainian numbers of claimed Russian kills they it's taken a lot of anti-tank weapons for every tank they're destroyed yeah partly that's the distribution problem that if you spread your anti-tank weapons across every soldier in the line then you don't have them anywhere near where the enemy thrust is coming well yeah all of them there but it's not that different a similar situation to when the panzer files came out in World War II or when the Russian anti-tank missiles came out in yeah saw you in 1973 in Yom Kupur there have always been moments when tanks are very vulnerable to these things generally countermeasures come into place tactics change if it stops you using your tank as offensively as you like then that anti-tank weapons having a very real effect but it's also with noting tanks aren't that expensive in the world of military procurement in China five to ten million dollars per tank depending on on on what you're getting yeah not by air force not by yeah yeah so let's let's let's go with five million as there's a as a throwaway number it's cost well over a million dollars a year to keep a Western soldier in the field if putting them in a five million dollar tank means there are one tenths likely to die early that investment really starts to look like it's paying off so you then need to consider all the costs I guess the anti-tank weapons are definitely you know creating headaches and problems that's no doubt about that and the technology of top attack is definitely driving big changes in the next generation of tank design as I think I handed out earlier we're probably not going to see ammunition stored in the crew compartment haven't anymore right right I think there have been early low-tech precedence for this this is my swath segway back to Tunisia I was reading up on the the battle of the casserine pass in which eventually rommel you know up against a really lame american general led the american tanks and half tracks and other vehicles into a trap where I think 88 millimeter guns which were very effective unguided German weapon just killed an enormous number of them the Germans had a tactic they called sword and shield where they would present a bit of a strong front and then withdraw and time and time and time again the British and then the Americans would chase after them into the concealed ambush of the 88s and the partly that was because British armoured doctrine pretty much demanded that if the enemy is withdrawing you must follow so you know it's a firing squad offense for officers who didn't do that pretty pretty blindly and you know because what do you do you see you know you come back and say oh the enemy ran away so we didn't chase them and you don't know that yeah you can't prove the ambushes there if you don't wander into you're living down your hyphenated name and when the British had pretty much figured that out by the time casserine happened but yeah tried probably didn't do it in an approach in a very good way tried to warn the Americans about this and you can imagine some super silliest British officers trying to tell you how to do your job you might not take it in the spirit of intended so the Americans also fell for it in pretty much exactly the same way I mean it should also be noted though that a huge amount so american artillery finally stabilized the situation at casserine so big guns are a problem for tanks and as even as a mad king tank enthusiast I'm not going to lie about that it's just astonishing to me that an unguided artillery piece can kill a moving tank but I think they had some amazing rate like they killed a tank for every 20 rounds fire yeah I mean the 88 was intended as a divisional aircraft piece which again weirdly turned out it was good for tanks because it had a really high muzzle velocity so at least that simplified the the aiming that you pretty much put the crosses on what you were trying to shoot instead of you know otherwise if you're leading moving target but at world war two tanks remember they did have to stop the fire if they wanted to fire with any sort of accuracy so it was a bit of a more stop start affair and if I've stopped the fire then then you can shoot at them and things like that yes you got to be a damn good gunner they catch something like that as it take I mean you know they're citing must have been pretty amazing well the survivors had a bit of practice and yeah yeah that's right that's right yeah well anyway I we've had a great overview here of tanks I mean tanks have all been in the news although it's funny I don't know if you noticed this john like as soon as there was all of this uh chat went on for about two months you know you've got to get them the lepers in Germany selling in blah blah blah and as soon as the Abrams and the lepers were announced that they were going there I mean literally within a day or two it was yeah that's fine but what they really need are F-16s I mean that was almost immediately and there was the don't get your hopes up okay yes yes yes it's gonna be nice but they it won't happen overnight but it will happen as Rachel Hunter used to say I mean they're good for morale for Ukrainian morale it's good to know that they're willing to cross these red lines you know so-called red lines and back up Ukraine even if though you're not gonna be the game changer I mean I guess that's their primary use and also draws these countries in deeper into Ukraine side well while we while we've got time we should let john Griffiths boost his show because this has been a great advertisement for the show and you need to tell people how to get it absolutely so thanks so much for having me on the show the totally tanked podcast if you search for us totally tanked and ignore anything about aquariums the aquarium supplies doors and us fire search and optimization um you'll you will find us we're available on pretty much all the podcast apps we do also do a YouTube live stream that people are welcome to um correct us all our terrible mistakes as we go uh but yeah just search for totally tanks um you will almost certainly find us and um yeah we uh we certainly it's funny you know everyone keeps telling us how the tanks are obsolete it's like yeah maybe in one day it will be um yeah yeah but you know this war it's all about tanks and so huh yeah these experts would tell them you're there completely obsolete yeah I mean I guess it depends on the war yeah I've heard that for most of my life it depends on the war and and that war which is post tanks has not yet come yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean obviously Ukraine is a great tank country famously great tank country uh but also say war at just the right threat level uh Quality of suits tanks versus versus other things it was a higher intensity war maybe not you know if there was a lot of air power being used on both sides to be more of an air war but uh as it currently stands it's it's a bit of a tank war so so here we go and I've got to say the number of downloads of our leopard 2 and um T72 episodes of people definitely searching for information at the moment yes yes they have full episodes on all the various tanks not only just the tanks that are being used or being slated to be used in in the Ukraine war so you can know more about them but also historical tanks uh I don't know you guys just did an episode I think on a Japanese tank I mean you you guys definitely talked in yeah right yeah the motivation tanks and the Japanese and Korean ones they're doing some really interesting innovating the fact the parlance just ordered a whole bunch of uh Korean tanks um should tell you that uh there's this and really good stuff coming out of that part of the world as you'd expect even they're very good at heavy manufacturing yes yes yeah interesting all right well uh John Griffiths thank you so much for joining us on radio warning really appreciate it thanks god it's been great okay thanks again to john Griffiths of the totally tanked podcast and um that's great to end a month with pure uh hardware yeah there's nothing more hardware even tanks right for the old yeah for the young middle or nerdling yes exactly uh okay well thanks again everyone for another great month and Brennan john uh john how oh right you're gonna be leaving uh carthage in Tunisia pretty soon right john and you're going to sadly yes we're going first to London and we have a right warnered
