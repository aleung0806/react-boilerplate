    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. The day today is October 18th, 2022 and this is episode 350. We just keep hitting these scary milestones. Anyway, I'm the coast of the show, Mark Gaines here in Rochester, New York. And I'm in line with the Warner Gary Breacher, aka John Dolan, and Trees Treesda in Italy, John, how you doing? Hi, well, yeah, Treesda. It's in Italy for the moment. It's one of those cities that's been passed around a lot. But I gotta say, I love this city. Treesda is beautiful. It's so much cooler than Calabria was and we're a couple of blocks from the sea and unlike Tropea where we were, the sea is not at the bottom of a 200 meter cliff that you had to walk up and down every day. The sea is right surprisingly at sea level. And so a long time since I heard you say you like to city. So this kind of refreshing. We're doomers and stuff. And you know, that's simply not true. I have a positive outlook toward life. Oh, no, no, no, just certain cities. Yeah. But that's good. I mean, yeah, you get. Well, you hear Slovenian in the streets occasionally. And you certainly see advertisements in the language that I can tell is Slavic though. It's not written in Cyrillic letters. It's sad to say the Cyrillic alphabet is losing out, I think. It's fading from a lot of places. But I think it's war is helping out a lot. Yeah, even the Tajik leaders dressing down Putin these days. But yeah. But anyway, it's this place has an amazing history. And it's also really beautiful. People, people from one thing, they're like, I had taller than the people in Calabria. And I have deeply high-distance instincts. And I respect everyone who's taller than me. And most people are. Well, damn, then go to Belgrade or better yet Montenegro. But go to it's, I mean, I'm short there. I think I'm fairly tall. And like, yeah, when I was in Belgrade once, years and years ago, just after Milosevic was overthrown, I remember sitting there with this film director, God, what was his name? I can't remember his name now. Some other people in Vladivost, remember him? He was at the table next to us. Wow. And he fit in. Like, he didn't look. OK, he was taller, a bit taller. But he basically just blended in at this big meat outdoor grilling restaurant. That was great food. And then the Montenegroans are kind of famously even taller. So if you're a hightest, you're getting close to Heit Mecca. Wow. Yeah. Yeah, it clearly makes a difference. So people here look completely different. I mean, I was telling Catherine, you can see why the Roman forces went for, they always taught their soldiers, stab with the gladiol, which is basically a big knife. Don't, don't slash. And you can just see dealing with various vandals who were considered the tallest of all the barbarians and Germanic people and Slavic people. Someone's raising this giant sort of tire iron thing over their head, ready to bang it off your skull. And you're from your Joe Pesche perspective, just sort of stabby stabby stabby with the gladiol. Do you think I never fucking stabbed a vandal? No. By the way, little trivia, maybe urban legend or regional legend or not. But I remember reading a study on Slavic. And it claimed that Slovenian is the closest to kind of old, original Slavic of any of the Slavic languages. Russian, for example, has been, it's kind of almost a bit more like English and that it has absorbed so many foreign words. If you remember Solzhenitsyn, the top of his head used to bounce up steaming from that and he's always looking for an old Slavonic word to replace the non-Soviet. But I think it's kind of what makes Russian so great as a language. But Slovenian apparently is kind of like the purest if you can find old Slavic. But I'm sure some of the penance in our audience will have words to say about this. Well, yeah, I mean, I don't blame me blame my Cold War Russian teachers, but I remember wondering where the Russian word Voxal came from. And they said it came from Voxal with VAUX HALL, the big train station in England. And they just applied it everywhere. And of course, there are even more French and German words because the influence there lasted longer. And Tartar words and whoever was around. Voxal wasn't that the name of a technopop band or something? It might have been. I don't know. Or my thinking of Autobahn. Anyway. So today, I think we should start off by doing a bit of a recap of the latest of the, well, the biggest war in the news in terms of where the Western world is focused and the G7 world. And like it or not, the war that does have the most global sort of impact because of particularly the economic side of this war, which is of course the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the war in Ukraine. September, of course, was a really good month for Ukrainian forces. We talked about that in previous episodes. The Ukrainians mobilized many, many forces and the Russians were have been extremely, like almost inexplicably poorly commanded. And they were stretched very thin and the Ukrainians launched a series of counteroffensives and eventually broke through in huge ways in September. At the end of September, of course, President Putin announced mobilization and then they did this kind of sham referendums to annex four regions of Ukraine on top of Crimea, which has already been annexed. I think though probably more important since then, quite possibly it seems, is the appointment of, because right after Putin had this big annexation party and this whole grotesque ceremony and all this stuff, Russia lost Lehman, which was an important strategic city, Railroad hub, all of that. And Luzin Lehman and before that is Yom, it seems I don't see how it's possible to take at this point anyway, to take Slavionsk and, you know, Kramatorsk and really try to get the whole of the Donetsk region, the Donbass region. But I do think an important shift on the Russian side. So you know, through the end of August, there was very little movement in this war. It was a say from April through August. It was two old men sort of beating each other up, but then the Ukrainians, as we already described, broke through in a big way in September. And the Russians announced the mobilization and then after those losses sort of really wore them down and after the successful sabotage bombing of the Khromian bridge, Putin announced that he had appointed a new commander of the Ukrainian war, Sergei Suroviken. And you've seen, since Suroviken was named commander, you have seen changes. And the kind of, I guess you call it, the hardline patriotic, pro-war, you know, faction Russia is getting what it wants, getting more of what it has wanted, I think, at this point, which is namely, John, I mean, going after Ukrainian infrastructure, particularly power infrastructure. Yeah. We've talked about that before by way of saying it's odd that they didn't do that right away. One thing that's become clear about war in this century is that the first thing you do is take out the internet and take out the power. I mean, the power was a given in 20th century war as well, but now you add the internet to that. And Russian forces weren't doing that. And that seemed odd. Really odd. You know, again, so what, you know, people will find this funny probably, but within the Russian side, Putin is often seen and criticized for being hesitant. I mean, I know even people like Edward Limonev, the famous writer who died two years ago, who also wrote for the exile and was turned very much to his nationalist side when all of this stuff started happening in 2013, 2014, 2015. People like Limonev were very critical that Putin did not, basically they argue that if he had invaded Ukraine and taken Donbass, then rather than just Crimea, that Ukraine couldn't have done anything, which is probably true because Ukraine was still very divided, very weak. It didn't have all that NATO training, arming and time to prepare defenses and so on. It's probably true, but Putin wasn't ready to go there yet. I mean, God knows one thing we've learned from this war, he's not the most brilliant commander. No, no. He had a run of luck in Crimea and Syria. As I understood it, Crimea was the prize. Yes. Donbass was not the same glorious land that Crimea was in the Russian imagination. Yeah, I mean, and it could have kind of probably stayed that way. I mean, people say, well, he had no choice. He had a lot of choices. It's kind of absurd. There's always that choice. And launching this massive war was a bad, it was a really dumb, bad, on top of being criminal choice. But anyway, he did it. And it's been conducted thus far, incredibly poorly. And one of the big questions hanging over it went questions about the Russian conduct and it's really baffled. I mean, not just us, but if you sort of watch any of the sort of think-tink military analysts in Washington or London, they've just been absolutely baffled by how poorly the Russians have planned early on up to the war and executed all throughout the war. It's just been absolutely baffling. And another example of his flaying and waiting and waffling, if you want to put it that way, is waiting to mobilize. I mean, had put in mobilized back in March or April and it was pretty damn clear the Ukrainians could fight really well and had the full backing of the West, which is very important. If he had mobilized then, those troops would be, I mean, the forces mobilized would be deeply involved in the war by now, rather than rushing some recruits they dragged off the streets to the Donbos, which they're apparently doing already. I mean, there were people who were mobilized 10 days ago already going back in coffins back to Russia. That seems to apply also to what is clearly the new Russian military policy of attacking Ukrainian power plants with these missiles they bought from Iran. The missiles are Delta wing shaped, inexpensive single use missiles. You call them missiles and not come in causally drones. Loitering munitions, yes, that can hang in the air for a very long time because they have a theoretical range of over a thousand kilometers, which means they can just buzz straight to the target because they're driven by propeller engines, propellers in the back of a Delta wing shape. Or they can loiter above an area waiting until they see a target and then zoom onto it and destroy themselves, perhaps joyously like the bomb in Dark Star, one of Carpenters early on the last day of the day. That's another question that we've been asking straight through. Why was the Ukrainian power grid and even the Ukrainian internet and telephone system left intact? To do it now, well, it makes a kind of sense in that winter as script writers or want to say is coming and maybe, okay, you destroy the power just before winter and that's got a serious effect. But destroying it eight months into the war is a very odd thing to do. Reminded me of when I was very, very young when LBJ had this strategy of gradual escalation which just about everybody in their dog knew was a terrible strategy. You don't do gradual escalation. You produce what you can do and then drive the opponent to negotiate. But instead there's been nothing all this time against the Ukrainian power grid. And now suddenly they're sending these so-called kamikaze drones against it. The damage that they're causing to Ukrainian power infrastructure seems to be getting increasingly effective. It's all power plants from US doctrine at least. Every time we've seen the US launch wars, it's the first thing they go after. So it has been kind of strange what the thinking is. What the pro-Russian side, I think sort of analysts are sort of just baffled by it. What the pro-Russian side says is Putin is trying to fight a humanitarian war. And this will make, I think anybody who's not a pro-Russian laugh. I don't know. And I just don't know if that is true or not. It's hard to really actually understand why they wouldn't do that. Well, there are a lot of examples of overconfident arms, not destroying things because they assume they're going to walk in and take everything intact. And certainly there was a lot of optimistic military planning in the early days of this. Yes, and then when we've got Kiev, you know, like first catch a rabbit because they didn't even come close to taking Kiev. So maybe that was part of it. There have been other theories I've read about. Like, oh no, they don't want to destroy the communications network because they're listening in. I don't know. I mean, certainly Russian military officials sometimes value operational security over logistics. That happened in the beginning of the war. Like we thought, among other things, this couldn't be a full-scale invasion because they hadn't notified the mid-level officers. Well, they just didn't notify them. They just said, you're going in. If they said, yeah, but the trucks don't run. It was like, well, make them work. But you said it in the review, so they do run. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So maybe this was part of it. Like, you know, oh, we can spy on them. We can get information. Yeah. Yeah, you can, but was it worth it? I'd seriously doubt that's it. You know, there's a lot of questions that hang over every aspect of Russia's sort of strategies and tactics and everything in this war. I mean, where has their air power been? What are they trying to save? That gets to the question of why they've had to buy these drones, loitering munitions from Iran. I mean, Turkey is a big producer, but Turkey probably said, no, we got to keep the NATO fiction going to the point that we can't really sell you our drones, which are not simple cheap, common cosy drones, but really good. Unfortunately, US style. Reusable. Yeah. Reusable drones. Yeah. These things originally called the Shahed 136 seem to reveal just by the fact that Russia has had to buy so many of them and is embarrassed about buying them. How weak their drone force is. One of the strange things is that they've renamed them the Geron-Dvah, the Iranian. And Metri Petsov said officially Russian equipment with Russian names is being used. You paint over Shahed, which originally meant witness in Farsi, and then you paint on Geron. Yeah, okay. Now it's got a Russian name. But still, you should have had your own drone. I know that this has been a controversy having paid attention to and read some of Russian military sites and social media for a while now. But going back to the 2020 Kaderbach Artsakh war between Azerbaijan and Artsakh Armenia, that it exposed how behind, because Armenia and the forces there, it all been armed by Russia, by Russia. Whereas Azerbaijan got some arms from Russia, but also from Israel a lot, from Israel and Turkey. And it exposed how behind Russia was in drone technology. It caused enormous outrage actually among sort of the pro-Russian side. They didn't have, it's not that they would have necessarily even sold all of this to the Artsakh forces or Armenia. But it was sort of one of those moments of where everybody kind of came out with their criticisms because it was seen sort of as a defeat for Russia by nationalists anyway, not for Putin, but by nationalists. They were talking about how behind Russia was in developing drones, in certain types of drones, in anti-drone technology, they were supposed to be way behind. And this became an issue again throughout this war, especially in the summer and the early autumn, how behind they were, how much money was stolen from sort of technology, like incubators that were supposed to help incubate and create drone technology. And they're accused of just stealing all the money from that and producing nothing. It's kind of baffling. Again, they went into this war very unprepared. It's kind of shocking. The Ukrainians have been, appeared to have been a lot more effective using drones, especially for like spotting and reconnaissance and stuff. Early in the war, the Turkish drones seem to be effective and also just taking out like bombing columns of Russians. But you haven't heard much about the Turkish drones since then, right? I mean, it's been a while. No, no, that's true. Yeah. And it would be interesting to find out why. At the moment, I don't know why not. I mean, maybe I have trouble believing the Russian forces have come up with effective countermeasures because they just don't seem prepared for drone warfare. Maybe they've decided to back off on using the Turkish drones, especially because they wouldn't be as effective in the artillery stalemate, which was the middle phase of the war. Yes. John, what's happening, too? And we're going to try and get some more of a drone expert to discuss this more in detail. What's interesting about the use of this kind of drone is that it's really cheap and it overcuts slow, but it can get right to its target using apparently GPS systems you can buy off Ali Baba. And it's very effective. And so they're making up for speed and high tech with swarms. It's just warm up. And you've talked about this. Yeah. This is one reason you've argued that that navies are obsolete because and you're kind of what this is overland, but you're kind of watching this. I mean, it's very cheap. I mean, it's what, maybe $10,000, $20,000, depending on the size of this drone. That is unbelievably cheap for this kind of weapon. And what suggests it's effective has been there's a lot of disingenuous talk going around by Anglo defense sources like someone named Simon Puri from a British think tanker said, this is not sustainable. These drones cost up to $20,000 each and it's like, are you kidding? I mean, that's pocket change in defense terms. So it suggests that as old Slavoy would say, it means exactly the opposite. It's kind of scary to these people that Iran, the country they probably hate the most, now have these swarm weapons that are very cheap, easy to use. And the interesting thing about them is that they're like not the V2 of late World War but the V1, the buzz bomb, they're slow, they're loud, you can see them. And this has encouraged people to fire off any weapons they've got. Have you seen those clips of cops firing machine guns? Like those bullets come down somewhere. That's the thing. Yeah. And so now there's been an official announcement from Ukrainian military. Oh, good. Please, civilians, stop firing your weapons at these things because yeah, every bullet that you shoot up in the air is going to come down somewhere. And the heavier the weapon you use, the heavier the bullet, and it's going to do a lot of damage. And that damage is going to be taken for an enemy action. And that's going to cause false intelligence and in short chaos. And worst of all, you don't shoot them down. They're very hard to shoot down with small arms. And in fact, a Ukrainian fighter plane has crashed after shooting one down because you can't shoot them down with cannon on a fighter plane. But apparently the Ukrainian fighter blasted the Iranian drone. And then the Iranian drones remains flew right into the engine and messed it up badly and the fighter crashed. Now that's not a good exchange. $20,000 drone for a 50 million at the minimum fighter. So yeah, they're very annoying weapons. And it's almost as if they're meant to show up the fiscal absurdity of late 20th century NATO warmaking. And even anti-aircraft missiles and anti-aircraft systems. So we're sending some more high caliber systems to Ukraine. And they have them clearly on the battlefield to protect troops in various fronts. But it's a massive 1,000 kilometer front or whatever. You can't then protect all the cities too. We're sending some stuff there. But again, so you shoot down a $20,000 drone with what a $3, $4, $5 million missile, like after firing, firing up two or three that miss. And it's going to be one interesting thing is who's going to start genuinely running out of equipment first? Everyone has to take the battery. Get batteries before because they were shooting down cheap or they were shooting at cheap gigantic scud missiles. And a patriot is a very delicate, guided missile. And they were running out of the inventory. And that could easily happen. That's what swarm weapons are supposed to do. And that in fact is why if you ever follow especially navy sites, they're always on the verge of having a laser that can do this. Because a laser beam in theory costs only the charge of producing the power to generate it. It's not a guided missile with very expensive electronics inside it. So it would be so nice if we could handle swarm weapons with these lasers, but these lasers are always on the verge of happening and they never quite happen. So right along there with flying cars. So just to get the sort of russians out of this, so basically every day they're hitting critical energy infrastructure. They're not destroying it completely, but they are, the Russians are degrading Ukrainian energy infrastructure. It seems pretty clear. I mean, I'm just looking at the map from Rybar, which is this Russian pro-military social media site. There's a good 20 places that they hit. I mean, basically going for major power stations in big cities from Liviv in the West to Nopo Khmelnitsky, several in Kiev to Harkiv, Zaporoszya, Nipro. And they are, they're causing blackouts. Some of these places are getting back on after a while. They're getting energy partly back on. But what they, what they're claiming here is after listing every place hit just yesterday, and they're doing this day after day after day with these drone swarms. Here's what they say based on the available information. We can say with certainty that destruction of the energy infrastructure continues. And this time it was 750 kilovolt substations. Yes, the damage is not as massive as it could be. The most important result is the deterioration of Ukraine's entire energy system on the eve of the cold weather, as you said. A four shutdown of the energy system could have been done. Precision missiles and UAVs are being used. So they're still kind of claiming they could fully shut it down, I guess. And what's also kind of interesting, Ukraine has been exporting some of its surplus energy to Europe. And I don't think they're able to do that anymore. I mean, there's just such a unbelievable energy cluster of fuck going on in Europe right now that is actually extending here to the New England area. And I'm really curious. I've seen, I've seen a version of this article a couple of times and it just came out again the Wall Street Journal that New England could face blackouts this winter if it gets rough here. Because New England power stations rely a lot on LNG rather than, I don't know why they don't get straight in pipe natural gas. So they rely on LNG, which they have to buy in the spot markets. And as we know, having had Ben RS under show a few times, we talked about this. I mean, the price of LNG, which is the liquefied natural gas that is put on ships and can be shipped anywhere, everybody's bidding on it. So everybody's bidding it up. And there is a shortage of it. And I mean, God, I just, I can't believe the Democrats didn't plan for this. So there's this sort of talk that even American LNG could be shipped because the market over all this could be shipped to Europe rather than New England could go cold this winter. There's the market, but you know how they are about the market. It's sacred until something else is more important. Yes. Then it doesn't come up at all. Like, people used to think American conservatives cared about the market and then Trump came along and they realized, oh, nobody cared about the market. Free markets, my ass. They just wanted somebody to work out on. So I think there's a real gap here between the elite both in Northern and Western Europe and the US and the populations, which is for the elite, the war in Ukraine is all important. For the populations, that's not as clear. So that the elite in the US might be very willing to ship US LNG to Europe to make up for what are going to be some pretty horrific shortfalls this winter. But yeah, that how that would play when you're trying to win the midterms. I don't know. Or even after. No, yeah, there's no way they're going to let them, well, I take that back. There is a way they'll let them freeze. It would be hard to believe. But so much is hard to believe these days. Yeah. Yeah. But we'll see. And I'm just. The interesting. I just wanted to mention that Ukraine has, the government of Ukraine has not tried to hide the effects of this attack on power. They say. As of one hour ago, Russian strikes have left 1,100 towns and villages. And Ukraine without power. And these are all over the place. Deepropetrovsk, Kerovo God, Jito Mir, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Zaparija, Lugansk, Mikhailov, Kherson, all cut off from electricity, which is kind of an interesting look at the way the PR war, which has been a massive victory for Ukraine so far, is going. You stress the suffering inflicted on your own people, but up to a point, there will come a point where you don't want to stress it anymore. You want to probably stress suffering to the people, but not to the military. You want to say the military is victorious or no news. And the military, the Ukrainian military, has throughout the war fought really well. And the last month and a half, it's paid off a lot. Their offensives do seem to be grinding down to a halt. Not going to make any predictions here again. Anything could still happen. The last big sort of moves they made while taking Lehman and they look like they were, so this is in the northern part of it. Northern sort of Donbass area. It looked like they were going to take maybe Kremlinina and Rubizia. Well, basically, make their way right to Lysitchansk and Siveta Donetsk, like the two large cities that Russia took earlier in the summer. But it seems to have been ground to a halt. For what I'm seeing, the Russians have already moved, mobilized, like freshly mobilized reserves to various points on the front, especially I think up there, up in the more northern part. I mean, we've already seen stories of, I think, there was a Moscow city official who was mobilized in a space of 10 days, who was mobilized after Putin's mobilization order. And then, dead and put in a coffin and sent back to Moscow. I don't think that's happening on a large scale yet. I would be surprised, but I don't know. Who the hell knows? Who knows how many forces they even have that, what the holes they're trying to plug there? Because as we talked about, there were reports from the Russian side that was re-reported by some think tankers in Washington who have been watching this, that the Russians had no more than sort of 55 to 60,000 troops manning a 1,000 kilometer border. And that a lot of these units were now down to, like, these BTGs were down to 30% roughly of strength. And they have massive holes there, all up and down the front. One thing I found out going back because I'm trying to collate the newsletters is, I looked at the very first radio-warner newsletter, which was seven years ago. And it was about Ukraine, and a lot of it shows how little has changed. I'll just read a bit of it. It goes, Ukraine. A lot of readers said they'd like to do more on the war in the Donetsk base. Donbass are not changed. Yeah. It's a typical 21st century war, slow, small scale, increasingly dominated by mercenaries. Just go back 70 odd years and you'll see how profoundly warfare has changed since World War II. In the early 1940s, Ukraine was the perfect killing ground for two huge mobile armies that recruited every available man and in the Soviet example, woman. Now on the same ground, a stagnant war is sputtering along, again, this is 2015, fought by a weird mix of middle-aged amateurs and proxies from a from afar, who can't even manage to round up 25,000 recruits. They came up with a little more than half that target, though the recruitment number is a ridiculously low for a country of almost 50 million people. And that's really true. It's remarkable even now how difficult it is to get cannon fodder compared to how easy it was in the 1940s. Right. Yeah, I remember reading something similar in that what is it? 85 days in Slavionsk about Gyrkin. Gyrkin, by the way, Styrilkov Gyrkin, he became very popular with the pro-Ukrain side and think tankers again because he was this fierce critic of this war and the way Putin has conducted it, even though he's a real far-righty Russian nationalist monarchist. And in the Donbass War starting in 2014, I mean, he helped launch the Donbass War on his own, kind of on his own, with winks and nods from certain elements in the Russian sort of special services. And that book written by another far-righty, they spent a lot of time complaining about how hard it was to get recruits and kind of how old the recruits are, which I was one thing we're going to talk about poilu, poilu, this French. Yeah, and I thought, I mean, how modern that sounded, a 40-year-old, which would be like in modern years, it would be more like, I don't know, a 50-year-old, like it's such a modern European war, the way he kind of describes his own experience. It's not one of these typical wild-eyed, romantic youths going in, but somebody more grizzled and cynical and stuff. And in fact, way back in 2015, Yasha was talking about this guy, Tex. Yasha had a video of Tex who later called himself the Donbass Cowboy in America from Texas, who was fighting for the Russians in Donbass. And I've read his book now. He has his own book. It's called Donbass Cowboy. And he's one of the, you meet these guys. He's grizzled white, sort of tough guy with a prison record and literary ambitions. And while most people like that break right, some of them break left, or what they imagine to be left. And that's what happened to this guy. He was from a family of like 10th generation Texans. He was named after the commander of the Alamo. And he did some time in prison. I think he never is specific about it in his book, but it was a smuggler of some sort. And he kind of curdled. He, you know, prisons, some bad marriages. So he ends up going to Donbass hoping to die in battle fighting for people who are hated by the American establishment. And that's about as far as he gets with his own analysis of what he's doing there. But what he described is units so small that everybody is on a first name basis. And they're trying to occupy big industrial complexes with a squad basically. Or a platoon at best. Yeah, that comes through in 85 days in Slovenia and Skolso. I mean, it's such, in that sense, it's such a different war. I mean, it's just whoever is willing to actually fight. And even on the Ukrainian side back then, the regular military wasn't really willing to fight. That's part of the reason why they needed these kind of, you know, ideologically infused with old fascism or neo-Nazid, whatever. These far right kind of ideological volunteer battalions as they called them, the right sectors, the azoths, all these guys. Because those guys were willing to fight. It was the same one was similar on the Russian side. And then you had criminals on both sides too. But on the Russian side, you had monarchists like Georgian people, you know, national Bolsheviks, Lamanos people, you had some of them into Borgadi. You also had sort of left anarchists on more on the Russian side. There were some commanders who were very openly kind of radical left anarchist or pro-communist. But at some point they were all brought to heal by the Kremlin. Yeah, well, there are some funny bits where text describes in his book, the kind of people he had to deal with. He ends up fulfilling the generalization that you said that these quasi-Nazi or outright Nazi creeps, they will fight. And they will fight to the death. Whereas he has these anarchist recruits from Western Europe. One of them flees from a firefight and locks the door. And there's text banging on this metal door. After that, he's kind of wary about his dilatant friends from the NATO countries. But he's very trusting. I'll just read this brief excerpt from his book, Donbass Cowboy. Most of the new recruits were flat broke and every time I went outside for a smoke, I would smoke one and give five away. For a while, I thought my new name in Russian was Daitsigaret. Give me a cigarette. It got all fast, but how could I refuse? These were my new comrades, some of whom I would soon be in battle with. And besides, why not pass them out? I am a communist. Okay. If you want to go in with that attitude, you will have some interesting experiences. Just as we've been talking about this, I decided to check the Guardian's continuous feed of Ukraine news. And as of 27 minutes ago, there's an announcement that, quote, NATO will deliver air defense systems to Ukraine to help the country defend itself against Russian drone attacks. Ukraine said it had faced a barrage of targeted attacks over the past weeks. Yen Sultanberg, NATO's secretary general, said, the most important thing we can do is deliver on what allies have promised to step up and deliver even more air defense systems. NATO in the coming days will deliver counter drone systems to counter the specific threat of drones, including those from Iran. No nation should support the illegal war of Russia against Ukraine. This is where you get into the complications of demonizing and then attempting to influence a country. I am not in any way a fan of the Islamic Republic regime in Iran. I hate those mean-hearted, hicks, misogynist bastards. But you can't demonize them for decades and then try to school them. You can only scold people who are in the family. And you kind of wrote them out of the family a long time ago. So I don't know how you can expect to wag a finger at them for dealing with Russia. We're sorry. I mean, it's really bizarre. I know. I mean, look, we have made it such that by also demonizing these other countries that it's in Iran's interest and China's interest and some other countries' interest that Russia not lose or at least lose badly this war because if Russian power like fanishes, which is really the goal of NATO in this war, then a lot of regimes are very vulnerable. And we've let them know that. It's kind of bizarre how we do that. You know, like you would think we would try and divide and conquer, but we're trying to put them all together for some strange reason. There was a Thomas Friedman story about a week ago which just dropped my jaw. It was like suddenly we are fighting not only Russia but China, well, first of all, suddenly. Yeah, it's as if the DC Defense Establishment has been trying very hard to get in a war with what is the bulk of the Asian landmass. Even MacArthur knew that wasn't a good idea. It's pretty damn weird, I know. And another country that whose leader anyway completely depends on Russia's Belarus. And I don't know if you've been following that, but there have been, I mean, Russian forces have moved in a lot of equipment, air power into Belarus recently. They're doing some kind of joint exercises. Lukashenko has been talking about provocations from Ukraine. One thing that I think is true because I've seen this sort of amplified by the pro-Belarus, pro-Western side is that kind of nationalist paramilitary have been trained up in Ukraine or I think Poland to be used against Belarus. And I think Belarus just assumes, or Lukashenko assumes, they're already being used to infiltrate and destabilize. The question is, will they open up that front again? Will they, will the Russians and will they get Belarus backing, small country, 9 million, but it's still something? Will they get sort of military backing from them for another push, especially to relieve their forces in the Kyrgyzstan, Zaporurgia, and the Donbass regions? It's believed that it's a bluff. I mean, I just, I saw a big think-tinker kind of guy, Belarusian Atlantic Council type doing this big Twitter thread, I think it was just the last day, arguing that it's a bluff. And I don't, my position still has, don't, don't try to be 100% sure on any predictions in the day or more. We all should be a little more humble about that now. Yeah, but the lesson I've tried to codify in my own head is just because something is stupid doesn't mean it's not going to happen. Yeah. And, you know, Lukashenko needs, I mean, Lukashenko can't really be peeled off no matter what. There's no way he can be peeled off. And if Russian power goes down, Lukashenko's out because Russia is all that is holding him up. He's not that popular. He's got the security structures that back him apparently, but it's definitely more vulnerable than Russia is to destabilization. A lot more. Well, I have to do my bit, bit of what aboutism now. I know it's a bit of a digression, but I can't help it. About a month ago, Iran launched drone attacks on Kurdish parties located in the Quesa independent north of Iraq, Iraq, Iraqi Kurdistan. One of them even hit the city where Catherine and I used to live, Soleimani and blue up the headquarters of a Kurdish party there, killing a lot of people who were just party organizers. They hit other cities in there. And we're not talking about border cities, we're talking about places far away from the Iranian border. This was in response to the riots in Iran, which have had a lot of Kurdish involvement, a lot of women's involvement, basically everything in the regime hates. There was very little media interest in those attacks. And there was certainly no offer to help the Kurds repel them in spite of the fact that this was done by our designated evil country, Iran against our supposed friends, the Kurds. Because a lot of other people, non-Kurdish people in the Middle East say, oh, they love the Kurds. They don't really. They betray the Kurds as quick as they betray anybody else, but they perhaps have found them more useful. But at any rate, the drones that were used in these attacks, which were very lethal and unanswered, were of course the Shahed 136, the same drones that were used to attack Ukraine after being sold on and renamed by Russia. And the double standard here, I hate to say it, but it's kind of glaring. There, even when it's Iran, even when we have every reason to demonize this country in the elite publications of the US, there was no interest in this. I think we were one of the few places to notice that it happened at all. It was just, yeah, some Kurds got blown up. I wonder why that is. I don't know. I mean, right now we only care about Ukraine. And it's not anybody to take the eye off that ball. And the media won't pay attention unless the State Department, you know, organizes the packages of attention. That better handed out to journalists and NGOs. So they didn't think it was worth it for various reasons. Yeah. Right. Getting back to the war. Just, I want to go back real quickly again. So, Sergei Suroviken's general named as commander, you know, the press on him is he's this really bad scary guy. General Armageddon is supposedly his nickname. I mean, that, you know, that's, it's classic sort of the Western description of things Russian tend to be there either completely incompetent corrupt and almost comically inept or they are general Armageddon, like, you know, ultra villains. I think the thinking is this guy may be more effective. I mean, if you're effective, if you're effective in the military as a general rule, you know, you're not going to be well-liked or you're not going to win any humanitarian awards except in this country. But he, a little bit about his background, I think he was Betznaz in the end of the Afghanistan war. He was a commander of a company, I believe, of BMPs of infantry vehicles that, when the push happened in August 1991 against Kordbachev and protesters in Moscow, tried blocking off roads. And then the Gekka-Chipad leaders, the the push leaders tried to get their forces to, quote unquote, restore order. None of the commanders, most notably General Alexander Lebed, Pafakhrachov, none of them sort of complied with the push leaders. Except one, this guy, Sura Viken, he ordered his infantry fighting vehicles to mow down a bunch of protesters that were in the tunnel, you know, in the garden ring, John, there's, I think this would be the one under a Noviar bot, I think is where it was, where there's where you go sort of underground there. And so he just ordered his, the BMPs to drive right over them and kill the few of them, a few protesters. The only deaths in the protest against the push were ordered by him. He was put in jail for six months and then Yeltsin released him and said he was just following orders. And he became, he sort of eventually rose up and I think gained some prominence. In the second Chechen war, and he really became sort of famous in the military, in the Russian military world, when he ran, I think he was the commander of Russian forces, certainly ground forces, if not all forces, maybe combined arms and stuff. In the Syrian war in 2017, which was a big year for Assad and Russian forces. And so he distinguished himself there. He would have worked with Soleimani and Syria then. Yeah, good point, good point. And a cutting to this year, he apparently was in charge of the Russian groups, the Southern group. From June, I guess, up until, until, very, you know, a couple of weeks ago when he was named the commander of all Russian forces, I'm not sure why, how he particularly distinguished himself there in the South. I guess, I guess the Southern front, at least until about two weeks ago, it held up a lot more strongly than certainly the, you know, the North and Hardgave. Maybe that's why, or maybe he was arguing for different tactics that weren't being approved at the top. And so he was saying, if I'm in charge, I would take out all the power stations and do whatever. It was viewed by the hardliners and by the hardcore pro-war people as a great move. Finally, the gloves are off. I mean, it's that old Vietnam thing again, you know, China, fighting it with one hand type-owner back stuff. Except that in this case, one thing that I sort of grudgingly have to admit for that perspective is that the old proverb about how you may as well be shot for a sheep as a lamb kind of applies. I mean, it's like what more can they do? This is from the perspective of people who want to see Russia as a great power. It's pretty clear and they're right that this is, as you said, an attempt to break that power. So, you know, why not go all out for a hard war? Yeah. It is bizarre. You know, the counterpoint is maybe they are and this is all they got. This is all that Jews they have. Not a lot, you know, they overestimated themselves and Langley and everybody in the West overestimated them for a variety of reasons. And this is all they've got. That said, even if this is all they've got, there's a lot you can do with a limited force. A lot more you can do with a limited force. And these drones, again, I think these Iranian drones really show. Look, Iran has been under sanctioned for God knows how many decades. And the idea that, sure, we're sending Russia back potentially a generation as Nabolina, the central banker, the Russian central banker said is going to happen technologically with these sanctions. But that doesn't mean you can't improvise. I mean, this is a pretty effective weapon. If you could produce these geraniums or the Shaheed 136s, you know, for 20 grand each and they're very accurate and hit their targets and it's a swarming weapon. So you're not going to have the $5 million Calibre cruise missile. But you're going to have, I mean, for $5 million, you know, you get what, $250 of these guys. It's like, it's kind of a no-brainer. And you can do it with Ali Baba by electronics. Yeah, I mean, Garmin GPS, you know, those cool little things that you have on the dashboard or the handheld models. It's been one of those original NASA technologies that filtered down quickly to the mass market and is now available to people who want a DIY kamikaze. So I think there's one other story that we need to talk about because there was kind of break on that story today and that's the Nord Stream pipeline's explosion. Because today Copenhagen police made an announcement to show that they're, well, they're drone-like submarine vehicles have photographed, videoed, the break and show that they were caused by powerful explosions. Yes. So the question is, who did that and why? Yeah, that's a good story. Let's, I have a couple things I want to say about it too. So let's take a quick break and after some music we'll talk about the big mystery of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipeline blasts. And Okay, we're back. So yeah, the big Nord Stream pipeline mystery. I mean, this is one of those mysteries where I posted something about it and other people have on the radio Warner Facebook page. Yeah, you've got a lot of pushback on that. Oh, yeah. I know. My general attitude is I'm not going to say I know who it is. And surprisingly, a lot of people already know definitely who it is. And it generally tends to go with this. If you hate NATO and the Western establishment, which is a very reasonable position to take, then you know that Putin wouldn't do it because why would he do something that's why would he blow up his own pipeline? Sun Sioux says always blow up your pipe, you know, and then the different memes. And it wouldn't make a lot of sense, but there would be upsides for it and not getting to that. Then it is positive that, you know, Langley did it or Poland did it. I kind of thought, okay, if somebody on the Western side would be responsible, maybe Poland, but then the more I thought of it, they just the polls, despite having a pretty loopy government there, like they wouldn't do anything without getting approval from. They wouldn't attack another Western NATO country in critical infrastructure, even if it's majority owned by Russia. Nevertheless, you know, Germany was getting a large percentage of its natural gas through the Nord Stream one pipeline up until a few weeks ago when Russia shut it down or about a month ago, let's say. So it's hard to believe that. I think it's slightly more plausible to believe, and then Langley, I mean, Langley, Gladio, et cetera. And like, okay, yeah, but we're already selling them all this overpriced LNG as it is. We've already destroyed, like we've already made them so totally reliant on this. Why would we even have to blow that up? Like, we already know that they're going to shift whatever's left to the US and our allies, their energy needs. We already got everything we want. I mean, the US has not been so sort of dominant over Europe in quite a long time and hasn't sort of had such a victory for NATO in quite a long time. I don't know, trying to remember things. All the news from Germany in particular suggests absolute lockstep obedience to the US program. Like, today, the interior minister, Nancy, Pfizer, got rid of some cybersecurity. Yes. Official for not being sufficiently anti-Russian, basically. Yeah, accused of basically being a winning or unwitting agent of the Kremlin. And, you know, God knows it's probably a bureaucratic fight of one sort or another there. But, yes, so why would the US and, you know, granted, it's, I think, majority owned by Russia, that pipe, the Nord Stream one pipeline, the Nord Stream two pipeline, I think is definitely owned by Russia, but owned or not owned, what it did is it supplied Germany and Germany has major gas issues, energy need issues. Major. I mean, it's heading into like a spiral right now. Like, I was reading about just one small example of the myriad problems they're facing. For diesel in Germany, the trucks can't run on the diesel that they produce there without this additive, called ad blue. It's some chemical mixture with Urea, Dionized water, but trucks can't function without it. And it's now so expensive to produce ad blue for the trucks because of the price of natural gas because natural gas is the energy needed to power the plants that make ad blue that you're looking at a complete collapse of Germany's trucking industry. I mean, you can go industry by industry, stuff shutting down, bakery shutting down, paper company shutting down, aluminum, it just goes on and on and on. And we're not even in the winter yet. So the idea that the US would be the one, would risk getting caught tipping Germany into like a depression potentially. It just, it doesn't make sense. When they're willing to do it themselves. Exactly. Exactly. Like, if they were being intransigent, then you would need to do some. And if you do a covert op like that, then you already have your false flag story all worked out with all your media assets and everything. Like, no one's still been able to come up with an explanation for what happened. So I don't know. I think it's not likely, but I'd be willing to believe given all the horrible, dirty, dumb things, Langley has done over the decades. I'm willing to believe it, but it's not like logic points me to that. And then, then there's Ukraine. Now, there's a there's a case to be made. Ukraine is really pissed off at Germany because Schultz, the prime minister at least, has the chancellor has been, although they're very pro-Ukraine, very anti-Russia, going along with all these sanctions, there have been more hesitant about supplying heavy weapons to Ukraine. And it's been driving the Ukrainians crazy. In fact, they had to recall when they're ambassadors because he started, he was going way over the top attacking Germans. And one thing we can say about Ukraine is that their secret services, and I think it's their G-U, I think it's their military intelligence that have been pulling these off. I mean, they've been pulling off some pretty spectacular acts of sabotage, the Crimean bridge explosion, the assassination of Dadya Dugina and Moscow. At least a dozen Russian military trainees blasted while trying to. Oh, no, no, no, that was, you're talking about the one in the last week and a mobile phone. Yeah, and no, no, no, that was a strange story. No, what that was was from what I read, the people who shot them were ethnic Tajiks because the Russians are trying to recruit from the Gasterbiteers. And the commander, it was like right out of, it's like a Russian version of full metal jacket, you know, just being extremely rude and disparaging about their Muslim beliefs, not letting them pray. You can imagine all the swearing and bliads and sukabliads and everything that went along with, you know, putting them down for being Islamic. Okay, this is full metal jacket first half shit, right? And they just went crazy one day and said that's enough and just shot a bunch of them. But I wouldn't be surprised if they do pull off something like that as well. There was a Crimean airfield, whatever was done there, missiles, whatever. So they've proven pretty darn capable. And, you know, it would be stupid as hell if Ukraine did do it. Over time, I mean, if it came out that Ukraine was behind it, that's a big if. And there's a big question whether they, whether they would even have the capability. But if they were to have done it, and they were caught out, you know, that's going to really affect support for the Ukrainian cause in Germany. I don't care what like you've attacked us. What? Like that could open up all kinds of Pandora's boxes. So you have to assume, I don't, I have to assume anyway, that if you had to place a bet on an actual intentional act of sabotage suspect, for me, it's the Kremlin. I still think there's a bunch of other possibilities. Some stupid accident, some act of malevolence that wasn't meant to do this. It wasn't really an, I mean, I don't know, there's a lot of possibilities that we can't imagine right now that could explain it. But for me, the, I don't know, the most likely explanation is, I mean, look, the one that was blown up and can't be used is Nord Stream 1. The Russians that shut it down a few weeks earlier, this causes more havoc. But, you know, surprise, surprise, the one that could be fixed very quickly and operational is Nord Stream 2, which this war is like half about Nord Stream 2, and the Germans, you know, maybe, maybe not are going to use it. And they had already announced that that's it. The Germans already announced Nord Stream 2 was dead. Before that, for years, Trump was trying to get Nord Stream 2 killed. The Biden administration was more clever about it. Like, okay, you can have Nord Stream 2. Just let us handle Russian diplomacy with Ukraine, and you know, which is happening to eat things up a little bit. But it was, it's been a big project in the West to get Nord Stream 2 killed and a big project in Russia to force Germany or not to force or to get them to use Nord Stream 2. Well, this acts, these acts of sabotage basically ruin Nord Stream 1 for close them, for close Nord Stream 1 is an option, at least for many, many months through the winter. Whereas, Nord Stream 2 Putin came out and said, gosh, wow, look, Nord Stream 2 can actually work. So, Germany, the balls in your court now, if you want to, if you want gas, you're going to have to, you know, say yes to Nord Stream 2, which is wars, I mean, in a sense, from the West point of view, this war is half about Nord Stream 2. So, he's put Germany in the position of saying, no, and I think Putin has been pretty stupid about the way he's calculated how Europeans will respond and the Americans and so on will respond. I don't know. There's just no way that Germany's leadership is going to say, okay, let's open up Nord Stream 2 for now. I mean, there's just no way that's going to happen. So, they already said no, and but that's the only one that can work. So, you know, and in the meantime, you get, you cause more havoc, you create more price havoc, and you create a more dire situation for Germany as the winter approaches and as industry is facing real deep, serious pain. That's my guess. I don't know what do you think now. That makes more sense. I mean, I don't know this as well as you do, but that, yeah, that seems to work. And I have no theories at all. I'm like the idiot friend of the detective in this case, saying, yes, well, why would they do that? Yeah, that's a smart place to be, and I should be there too. And my position, I mean, if I had to say number one, I'd say it's something we haven't thought of. If I had to say who is the most likely, I would, the thing is it's sort of like, well, who's the stupidest one around? And there's a lot of stupid going around right now, but, you know, everybody's capable of doing something totally stupid and self-destructive, including Putin. And he's already proven that and it just, I don't know, strikes me as the most likely if there is an intentional act of sabotage. Given the really tense, paralyzed politics over this, as you were saying before, it doesn't seem very necessary to physically destroy the pipeline. It seems like excess. So I guess one of the questions is who has various maybe competing secret services that are known to carry out actions on their own. So I don't know. A lot of people will fit that too. Yeah. And we don't know a lot about, I mean, it's not thought that Ukraine has the capability for this kind of operation, but who knows? There's a lot we didn't know about Ukraine's capabilities. So anyway, I'm willing to believe anybody. I'm not going to stake my life on it. I'm not going to do a diprediction. Ukraine is the graveyard of predictions. So I ain't going there, but we all have to, you know, as I said, Miller's Cross and just speculate on a hypothesis, John. Speaking of the military intelligence of Ukraine, the Goethe, he's the chief Kyrgyz Boudonov. I remember hearing about him before this war started as well, that the Russians really didn't like him, that he was becoming very powerful as the head of military intelligence. I think he took over in some time in 2020, later in 2020, just as a lot of Zelensky's politics were shifting from kind of peace deal with Russia to hawkishness towards Russia, and he was supposed to be one of the kind of key links in that. He just gave an interview to Ukrainian media and the sort of takeaways from this about what he's expecting in the near future. Huge, more big Ukrainian military advances by the end of this year. That is to say, taking huge swaths of more territory could be in the Zaparizha region, could be in Kyrs\u00e1n, could be at North Who knows. He's predicting the end of the war by next summer. He's predicting territorial and political changes in Russia, including some regions peeling off. That means I guess either going independent or joining Kiev. And he says that Russia's quote, economic center will be shifting towards Ukraine. It's a very, very ultra-nationalist view of things because this is like right sector as of battalion. If you watch any of their ultra-nationalist love remapping everything and getting off of that. Absolutely. This is exactly the center of power is returning to Kievan, the original Rus. The Russians aren't even Rus because they're Asians. It's always those guys are Asians. And the center of power and economy is going to go our way. And these regions are going to peel off and we're going to reunite the ancient Rus lands. It's kind of weird to hear. But intelligence chiefs can be really weird people. Look at Michael Flynn. It's strange because I don't seem to remember Kiev holding out against the Mongols either. But what I know. But the trouble with these predictions is that they tend to get made at the peak of Langley, Angloid, NATO support. And if Ukraine won this war and Russian power was broken to some extent or just plain broken, a lot of that interest would fade away. There'd be some other crisis to invest the money in. China. Yeah. The predictions might look kind of silly. And Ukraine would suddenly find itself abandoned as other roughly native exiliaries have found themselves abandoned. I think it's important not so much to believe these predictions. But to understand the mindset of because Ukraine is kind of a black box. I mean, before the war started, it was very fractured and there was a pretty lively media investigative media. And so it felt like we knew a lot more. And it's kind of strange how quickly Ukraine's kind of political factions and power structures changed almost overnight. The oligarchs, the economic oligarchs, became almost irrelevant. I mean, I think I've lost most of his industry. A lot of the oligarchs lost a lot. And they just became not important anymore. And we don't know much about the mindset and of the people who are in power behind Zelensky. Because Zelensky, of course, I mean, he's a leader. He's an actor, a comedian actor. He's a very, he's doing a good job at his job. But he is not the source of power. And I do think Guadanov and the military intelligence, I mean, I think there's been a behind the scenes, everything's going to be on the scenes, kind of power struggle between the military intelligence, the Gauer and the S. Beou, the secret, basically the successor to the KGB and Kiev. And what was it? One or two months ago, the head of the S. Beou was replaced. And so, you know, I mean, one of the most obvious examples of that kind of rivalry was when early in the war, when a negotiator for the Ukrainian side was shot and killed by the S. Beou. And it turned out that that negotiator who was killed as a traitor was actually a, was a military intelligence operative who was killed by the S. Beou. So it was a guy who worked for Guadanov and then was turned into a hero by Guadanov's organization. So I guess my point is just that, I mean, this is the mindset of extremely powerful pillar of Zelensky's regime right now. And this is not, this is not the mindset of people who are thinking, let's negotiate. Right. This is the mindset of people who are like, we are, the question really is only how much we're going to win and how much we're going to take. And, you know, these are not people that Zelensky can say, I'm in control, as far as I know, and I could be wrong, but he can't necessarily say to them, I'm in control, I'm now going to do the negotiating. Or that especially wants the sponsorship from, yes, call it NATO, whatever, the Hydra. When the sponsorship of the Hydra is withdrawn, then you find out how much power you really have. And he has that support right now, but it could vanish really quickly. I don't know. I think he's got the guns, he's got the spies, he's got the surveillance, he's got the bombs, probably the media assets. I mean, it's, I have to be honest, it's hard to say. And also, I mean, look, think about it when Zelensky's people were actually potentially negotiating a ceasefire. Boris Johnson flew in, probably on the White House's orders, to tell Zelensky not to negotiate. And so I think Budon of C's eye to eye with, I don't know, the national security state structures in the West, or certainly in London and Washington. But you're, you know, so if his, if the US politically ever said, you need to negotiate, yeah, Budon of would, it would be tough for him at that point. But one thing I'd have to say about, you know, Ukraine, I mean, Ukraine has never been an easy, you know, people think they get Ukraine and they really don't. And Russia, even with supposed, it's supposed proxies, like Yanukovych, I mean, they never, they never controlled Ukraine, but they were losing Ukraine badly after the Maidan revolution. And, you know, that's what precipitated from their point of view a lot of this. But it's, I'm not sure, you know, I don't know how much the West ever was in control either. Right. Well, what they think and what they really can do is there's a gap there. Yes. I'm sure they, they think they have Ukraine under control. Yes. It's unlikely. I mean, my, if the way I'm reading this, if we're to take anything away from me, I just, when you look at what both sides are doing and both sides, mentalities to this war, I just, the one thing I think that is least likely is like end of war next summer. I just don't see how this war stops. I don't, I don't know. Unless, unless really the West says, okay, we've, I don't know, we've gotten what we wanted or it's getting to a point where we don't want what's happening. But I don't see how either Russia or Ukraine stop so long as they have any bullets and any people alive. I just don't see it. No, no, wars, wars don't really stop as often as people think. Yeah, there's no likelihood this one would stop. In fact, it could get dialed up with some of the, those dialing nukes we were talking about last time. Or it could get dialed down in various ways. Or exported. There hasn't been much in the way of export. But all these military brass of all the armies at this point are spits, nods, types. So they specialize in Suleimanis kind of operations. And that's another dimension that we might see down the line. All right, so it's enough of this, I think for now. I'm sure there's a lot we're missing, but I don't cover some of it. But John, I know you just put out a great new newsletter. It should be going to shortly after we record this actually next hour or two about this extraordinary way. Pastumously published French memoir on life in World War I, in the World War I trenches on the Western Front. Pwalu, why don't you tell us a bit about it? Yeah, Pwalu is a remarkable book. And everybody should read it just for starters. It's the English translation of a war journal of Louis Bartat, a barrel maker who was 40 years old at the beginning of the war and was called back even though he'd served his time in the French army. Everybody, you know, in the French society of 1914, you were often called the class of something like you, the class of 1904, the class of 1905, because there was a pretty strict regime that everybody who graduated well or came of age in that year had to join the army. They were dead serious about forming a strong army in the shameful aftermath of the Frank oppression war. So he'd served his time long ago, but when the war started in 1914, he was called back and he kept this very good journal which he then developed into a work for his descendants. Louis Bartat was, as I said, a barrel maker. He was a follower of Jean-Joye, the socialist who controlled a left wing, not exactly communist party that really despised militarism. So he hated the idea of getting back into the army in the first place, but there was no resisting the tide of militarism as he calls it in 1914. Just consumed the entire continent. Broke most of the left wing parties. In fact, what happened to Jean-Joye himself was that he was shot and head twice by an assassin who was captured, kept in prison quietly for the four years of the war, then put on trial and acquitted. Because even though he never denied shooting Jean-Joye who was the author of Louis Bartat's hero, he never denied it, but they felt that he had done a patriotic thing. So in 1919, tried and released. Interestingly, he went to Ibiza, which wasn't yet a big tourist and cocaine destination. And he tried to live quietly the assassin that is in a village so remote it didn't even have a road, but the Spanish Republicans found him there, said, hey, this guy's a fascist and shot him. So he paid for his crime anyway. But anyway, so Bartat is drafted in the army. He's 40 years old. He writes this diary. His descendant finds the diary. His descendant is still living in Aud\u00e9 in the extreme south of France, where Bartat was from. And he gives it to the local high school teacher who starts using it in classes. And somebody discovers it, it gets published, it's a fairly big deal in French. And now it's been translated into English. And it's an amazing document. And a very necessary one. Because as I say in the newsletter, there's a real gap where France in the Great War, as they called it, World War One, is supposed to fit in the Anglo memory. There's an extraordinary number of London published and a smaller number of New York published memoirs about World War One and books about World War One. But in all of them, you find this strange thing. The French troops are marginalized. And I don't mean that in the usual academic sense. I mean literally the French were to are left in the trenches or the French were to are right in the trenches. And the sense is that they weren't quite the main thing. You needed some leavening of that hotter Anglo blood. And this kind of obscures the fact that 1.4 million French died in that war. And contrary to the Chees eating surrender monkey myth, they did not die trying to run away. They died charging into machine gunfire. They died under artillery bombardment where they died in poison gas attacks. And they formed the bulk of the opposition to the German army on the western front. But there's something strange that's happened because the French intelligence and this is a very reasonable reaction. They don't want to seem like militarists. In fact, they're allergic to the whole idea. The Anglo intelligence especially in London. Well, to say they don't have the same impulse is to put it very, very mildly. They are gung ho both hobnail boots into the memory of the Great War and the casualties of the Psalm and the Battle of Lois. So that we start to think all these western front battles were fought by Tommy's or in America. Although it is the World War I, I don't know to me Mark, World War I doesn't seem as important as World War II to most Americans. Oh definitely not. Yeah. I think as you wrote in your article, it's really the Anglo world. I mean the actual Anglo world. So it would be the Anglo and the English and the Australians and the New Zealanders. Not even Americans that much. Now to me, World War I is like a bunch of corny slogans and Georgian co-hand songs over there. Over there. Yes. The Dove Boys. And so I started trying to look at French popular culture in World War I and I don't know much about it really, but I do remember that if you remember there was a movie called Amelie that was very big around the millennium and it's it's starred Audrey Tattoo, this sort of win some Audrey Hepburn kind of heroin. Did you see that one? Nope. No. No. I'm a Lee. I'm a Lee maybe. I know who you're talking about. I know you're talking about, but I don't recall seeing it now. She's a very nice person and she lives in Paris and she tries to make everybody's life better. But what about her life? Eventually her life gets better as well. I see. The end. Anyway, so whoever made that wanted to follow up with a movie that was made in 2004 called A Very Long Engagement. And this was a big, big deal in French movie making. It was going to be a big, big hit. It had Audrey Tattoo. It had scenes from the Western Front and everything. It was a very long name. Tattoo. And it was a total bomb. It cost $57 million to make. It only grossed $9.5 million in North America and a total of $69 million, which was like roughly $10 million more than the production cost worldwide. That's not good. So there's no place really. Did you see it? No. No. I don't like that title either. To be honest. So there's this real gap for most anglos and particular about what happened with the French armies in the First World War. And the book that really should be doing that is of course, journey to the end of night, but there are problems with that too. Like Selene sort of blotted his old copybook in the next war and that got his novel kind of cancelled. To the extent that it's not even mentioned in the afterward of this edition. I noticed in my edition too, it wasn't mentioned. Yeah. I'm hoping that this book, Poilu. And Poilu by the way is just French slang for soldier of World War One. It means shaggy, you know, hairy. And it's a sort of affectionate scuffey term. I'm hoping that this will change that because a lot of people died in pretty horrible ways and they deserve some commemoration. And also the way in which they died, deserved to be remembered. That's what really struck me about this book. And people will read the newsletter when it comes out and they'll see this. But I just wanted to highlight one thing, which is what happens when you have a military brass which treasures attack and audacity above all else. Well, one of the weird things is, first of all, you haven't thought about machine guns very deeply. You haven't thought about artillery very deeply. But above all, you haven't thought about where the troops are supposed to get out of the rain. I mean, this is North, Northern France, Bartat, the author of Poilu, was stationed in Artois up against flanders. It rains all the time. It's like Seattle up there, isn't it? It's worse because it's colder. And there was no shelter. It was considered timid. Defeatest. Defeatest. Yeah. To provide the soldiers with cover. So you actually stood in the trenches 24, 7, 3, 6, 5, and Bartat, this kindhearted pacifist from the deep south has to stand in this for four long years, just standing in the trenches with the stench of corpses and the flies in the summer and the rats all season, getting rained on because to build a shelter would be Defeatest. Yeah. And that had not struck me. On, unlike Saylene who talks about the terror of getting killed, what Bartat focuses on in his book is the moment-to-moment sheer physical misery of being in flooded trenches up to your knees in freezing sleet, covered with lice and ticks run over by rats when you try to get some sleep. Anyway, people will read this and they can talk more about it, but I just wanted to introduce that. And also by way of saying, I know I've been a little slow with newsletters lately. I found it hard to produce a newsletter when I was doing four hours a day of intensive Italian in Calabria, especially with those temperatures. So I'm going to try to do more newsletters lately, but I hope people enjoy this one. Yeah, it's a great one. By the way, speaking of World War I novels, Saylene's, you know, those lost manuscripts. The first one was just put up in France a couple of months ago. Yeah. And it's like, as I understand it, it's basically like the first 100 pages or 50 hundred pages of journey to the end of the night, turn more into a novel only focusing on the war years. Oh, good. I've got to read that. I tried to find it. I couldn't find it. I thought I was looking for a Coss Peep, but it's not under that tolerate. No, no, no, it's gay. Yeah. And it's different than Coss Peep. And it like, it starts off, I mean, my French just is nowhere near good enough, but it starts off like right there in the trenches, kind of describing similar stuff, you know, rats and mud and just all the hell of it, but in Saylene style. Yeah. I mean, he's Saylene without seeming to be right early is actually so evocative and so he can just evoke so much without drawing too much attention to wow, look at this writer writing. And what I like about Bartat is he's not trying, I mean, he does bring you there from a different direction. It feels very immediate when you read him. It does feel like you're there, but he's just he's a good reporter. Yeah. And he's a decent guy and he's writing as a decent guy, which is not what Saylene is trying to appear at all. So he's trying to be comical. I think you put it out and and he is comical in a very grotesque and deliberately kind of self-loathing way. But yeah, hopefully there's going to be an English translation of Gare. Yeah. And then the future. I was thinking, you know, maybe one of the reasons why or a couple of reasons why in the Anglo world, the French role in World War One is so marginalized. I mean, one reason might be, well, it's sort of like they're intruding in our tragedy. I mean, definitely from the angle, it's like, you know, get out of our tragedy. Like if they're suffering too, then we're not so special because it's it they're really into ours. How special it was for us this tragedy. Like Peter Jackson, Jackson's version of it, the Gallipoli Australia. Oh yeah, I'm hoping people will enjoy the close-ups of the flies in Peter Jackson's exhibit because I have photos of them in the newsletter that I personally think are pretty during funny. Yeah. And then of course the other thing is World War Two. I mean, the French losing so badly and quickly, not having the will to fight, you know, then retroactively that makes you a lot less willing to say, yeah, these guys fought as well as we did. It's sort of like they just push them up to the side. It's too much trouble, really. You want the simple version. And then the simple version is, of course, to achieve eating surrender monkeys. Yeah. All right. I think on that disparaging note and this episode, but I definitely get the book, Palou. It's really good. It's it brings you right there. In fact, I remember when we talked about, it was either World War One lit or War Lit. And we need to do more episodes on War Lit. But people were suggesting Ernst Younger's Storm of Steel. Storm of Steel. I got to say I tried it. And I liked remarks when I read it as a kid. I actually really liked a lot all quite on the Western front. So it's not a, but I just found his book boring. I mean, he's kind of very good. Yeah, it's like a lot of Gungho war books. They're not that fun. You know, I tried Ahri Barbous, which is translated as under fire and that didn't do much either. Too much Tolstoy and Peasant wisdom to which I admit I am allergic. Yes. But this book is one of the real, it's the kind of book you want to read if you're interested in more literature and interested in that. Or just flies. If you're a big fly fan. Yes, which we are of course. All right. Good. All right. Thanks again, everyone. And talk to you again soon. Bye, John. Bye, Brandon. Bye. Thanks, everybody.",
