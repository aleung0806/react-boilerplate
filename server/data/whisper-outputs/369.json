    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. Today today is March 10, 2023 and this is episode 369. I'm the ghost Mark games coming to you from Rochester, New York where winter finally arrived in March, weirdly enough. And you're listening to Radio Warner. Subscribe to us at patreon.com forward slash radio Warner. Winterman line of course with the Warner himself Gary Bretcher, aka John Dolan. Winter came to Glasgow too just when we got here a couple of days ago. There's been no snow since we've been here but there was snow last night and God, it makes you think well you know sometimes in Moscow it would occur to you like God it must have been even worse to be poor back before central heating and apartment buildings and where you had to buy your own fuel. How did it how did they ever survive and you look out at this guy line of Glasgow and think God it must have been hard. And yeah this was one of the relatively prosperous parts of the non-English United Kingdom. So I don't know. I was just reading somewhere that the I don't know a lot of my English history. It's certainly not the social history or political history of the 19th century but that the charter's charterist movement started in Glasgow in the 1830s. That was I think basically a working class, one of the first mass on the Anglead world I think the first mass working class movement to get probably better working conditions. I don't know the version I saw was universal male suffrage which they eventually got I think. Yeah well there is a Scottish link to a lot of that. I mean the one I know best is that James Connolly of the Easter Rising fame and the Irish labour movement was born in Edinburgh and started in Scotland. How I wish I was an Ed in Edinburgh. Yeah there was a prosody problem there. Yeah I think a lot of the intellectual energy of 19th century Britain came from Scotland and I think the English said that themselves. Yeah a lot of their culture derived its power from Scottish ambition because the Scots were like the supposedly Celtic minority that had converted in the reformation and was acceptable if not fully acceptable then much more acceptable than the Irish. Yeah a lot of the big thinkers in the late 18th century. I mean Adam Smith of course wasn't huge Scottish I think. So good well anyway it sounds like you like it there which again is always a good sound. People are very friendly. Yeah. Sometimes incomprehensible but very friendly. Someone from here warned us it'll sound like people are angry but they're not they're just saying hello. Wait there's a meet up we may as well announce it here. Yeah that's right. We're going to meet up radio. Radio partnered meet up. March 12th which is a couple of days from now at 2pm at the Bell jar which strikes me is very weird because I think of the Bell jar as a Sylvia Plath novel about being a tortured adolescent a tortured blue chip adolescent for that matter but I guess Bell jar probably has other connotations here. Yeah for some reason when I think of Scotland made an impression on me there was that Scottish street guy kind of crazy tweaker in that Mike Lee film naked and he was like Maggie Maggie. You're the fucking shite. It's just shite for the Maggie. Do you remember that? Oh yeah. Yeah. I think you had a better tolerance for that film than that I did. I was just thinking oh yeah that this hurts. It was yeah it's pretty painful just that actor he was also in Big Lebowski with the host's name now. He's been in a lot of great stuff. He made a great Puritan and an otherwise ridiculous film called Restoration. Yeah. Oh and a priest he plays a crusader priest in Kingdom of Heaven. He was good there too. Yeah I feel like I saw him in another movie too and it was he I mean he has hell of range like a sane range. Yeah. So today we're going to have a great interview. We had some people on the Warner radio, Warner Facebook page asking what the hell is going on in Georgia. CNN did this huge thing. Is this the next Mideon like very hopefully. Oh it's Georgia is just like Ukraine is another Mideon. So we have a great guest. So Japanese it kind of straightened things out and really get into a big broader discussion about Georgia and politics, post-Soviet politics and NGOs and all this. So but before we get to that I think we want to do just a brief kind of war update. I mean we are a war podcast and John you took a look at the ongoing battle for Buckmood. I saw some guys talk is saying I don't you know I guess this all depends what the hell this even means but calling it you know the largest battle of the 21st century. The first thing that comes to mind are some of those huge battles in the very beginning of the year 2000 in that end of the the Eritrea and Ethiopian war. Those were massive tank battles but I guess some of those battles didn't last as long. I mean how would you you've been looking at it a bit you know the last couple of days what how would you sort of rate it. And are you able to even find out I mean there's so much you know flack out there. Are you able to find out much. I don't get the sense that it's as big as those or as big as the battles around Nasiria in the early days of the Iraq invasion but which I guess would make it into this century if not by much. But it's hard to find out because the press to a weird degree has just decided to become cheerleaders for the Ukrainian position and therefore it's hard to find out what casualties are involved what numbers of vehicles and people are involved. It's certainly been a big bloody mess for nine months straight so the the battles that come to mind are other so-called attritional trap because that's what Buckmoot has become for the Ukrainian command and their foreign advisers. And there are signs interestingly that the top of the Ukrainian command including Zalensky and whoever he speaks for has gotten intoxicated with war itself and that foreign advisers are saying well well well take it easy don't make Buckmoot your Verdun your case on it's not the right place for that. Michael Kaufman for example has been saying let's try Fulidar let's withdraw from Buckmoot and now try Fulidar that would be a better place for the big stand. Yeah I saw even Zalusian I think it was either Danilova Zalusian so one of them was saying you know maybe we should pull back but the president is saying no stay there my own read of that is that more practical military people both in the Ukraine armed forces and like NATO are saying what's practiced and like what Michael Kaufman is saying you know would be practical to whatever give up this city and make a stand elsewhere and save men and material but that but Zalusian this comes with a question of who stands behind Zalensky who is the real power you know that was something Seth Harp asked in that great interview we did with him early on in the war and it's very hard to know but I think it's pretty clear that nationalists you know they've been validated by Russia's end well what you've been a hero it kind of gets addictive yes and and I think it's very hard politically for a Jewish comedian you know even though his his his stature has gone up a lot inside Ukraine among nationalists a lot and they know how valuable he is for their cause nevertheless I think they have a lot of power and I think they will not you don't want to be the guy who who is seen as giving something up stabbing in the back like I that's the high read of it and so it's safer politically to stay there as long as the most nationalists you know types at the higher levels say we need to stay there yeah but there the signs that he's getting advice from cooler heads outside the nationals camper pretty clear like yes the Secretary of Defense of the United States Lloyd Austin said you know you could withdraw and this would not be quote an operational or strategic setback that is you know nobody's going to hold it against you in the quarters of power Jens Stoltenberg said the same thing the head of NATO it would not be a turning point yeah if you withdrew from Bach Moot but the point for Zelensky and his people who are there is that Fortress Bach Moot has become a symbol a real Verdun thing yeah and he said his rhetoric is somewhat wild lately and he said we are destroying the occup the occupier everywhere wherever yields results for Ukraine Bach Moot has yielded and is yielding one of the greatest results during this war but the trouble is you know you sort of have to pay for those results there's nothing special about Bach Moot in terms of traditional military criteria for strategic position this is not Stalin this is a city that used to have 70,000 people and it may be although it seems like a lot of Ukrainian population estimates are yes exactly because the country has been hollowed out by decades of emigration so it's not a big railroad junction it's not an important highway point there it's just a town that drew a lot of military attention those places can attract people for their symbolic value as they go on yes I mean Verdun is kind of a complicated example because it did have some strategic value that Bach Moot doesn't seem to have but the idea for Ukraine is make it an nutritional trap that is make them attack you and bleed them cause them casualties that's a valid strategy in some situations it's basically the Confederate strategy that worked during the US Civil War the Confederates tended to fail whenever they tried to move on to other strategies for example whenever they invaded the North they lost out but when they occupied a good position and made union forces attack them they tended to win that is they would cause many more casualties than they suffered but as with Ukraine the trouble was they had a much smaller population to draw from so even if you cause casualties at a rate of 2 to 1 the difference between the northern and southern fighting populations since the south could not use its slaves for ideological reasons for as soldiers the difference in population size between the northern and south was bigger than that and the north could eventually as grant realized just power through it Verdun is another example it was also supposed to be an attritional trap for the French army which had already taken horrendous casualties and and was a bit shell-shocked or so the Germans thought but they ended up losing almost as many people as the French army did and it was just a horror for everybody one of the one of the more recent examples of a supposed attritional trap was Kasson and we're talking about the the Vietnam war 1968 on the eve of the Tete Offensive a US firebase in the in the northern highlands Kasson came under waves of North Vietnamese army attack and General William Westmoreland the American overall commander in Vietnam and one of the stupidest people one of the most colossally stupid people ever to occupy a major command took the bait and said the the attack will come at Kasson and massively reinforce the place sent waves and waves of B-52s to bomb the jungles around it and Kasson turned out to be a distraction a diversionary attack for the Tete Offensive by the Viet Cong, not the North Vietnamese army so the North Vietnamese army was offering a diversionary attack for the the Viet Cong the amazing thing there is that even after the Tete Offensive people argue endlessly about whether it was a tactical success or not but it was a strategic success because after that no one with any self-respect in the United States could believe anything that came out of Westmoreland's mouth or the DOD spokespeople's mouth and they just lost interest in the war even the war monger said oh the hell with it this this is hopeless so Westmoreland even after that said Kasson was the real target and the whole Tete Offensive in every major city in Vietnam was just a distraction for Kasson oh my god wow so these these attritional traps so-called have strange effects and they they can just become a reason onto themselves you know we're we're having a fight the we can't lose as you say nationalist especially can't handle the idea of withdrawal or the idea of losing and they can become a giant campaign in their own right for no particular military reason part of the complication here in the Western narrative at least and you know I'm very wary about anything I read about Ukraine yes where does it come from what is the involvement of the Wagner group yes the Wagner private military corporation basically the the Russian black water if you want to call up that have you noticed no one ever talks about black water didn't quite they it's like they never happened it's the black one mercenary group that ever existed was Wagner and it's the most evil thing can you believe mercenaries it's so yeah but yeah so Wagner yeah I've seen these articles like 30,000 Wagner recruits have died of 50,000 casualties like how is that even possible with a private I maybe it is but I don't know where they how they get that from yeah the estimates of Wagner that I've seen go up to 70,000 so basically you know there's going to be a lot of lonely jailers in Russia like oh anybody here going down the corridor so yeah you can't believe this stuff I mean I'm reading like one article seems interesting I don't trust it but okay it's called Wagner tactics how do zex with three weeks of preparation achieve results and then I find out it's by Yuri butusov Yuri butusov is the guy who physically attacked somebody for being too pro-Russian on a talk show and you're dealing with some people who are not entirely trustworthy nobody even agrees about the size of of Wagner's forces the theory of recruiting disposable people has been practiced by everyone well maybe not every arm I don't want to say something like that but an awful lot of armies you could argue that most armies are composed of disposable people whether the people know it or not or people who are at least more disposable than the people who hire them so probably Wagner has recruited from convicts and it would certainly make sense that you'd rather they definitely have no they that definitely happened because they posted videos of it and they definitely have used them and you know and and have used a lot of them and a lot of them have been killed I just think have been killed or have you know survived and then got their amnesty as promised we just don't know the numbers yeah I've been reading Arkady Babchenko's memoir of the first Chechen war yes I mean those people were absolutely disposable yes punching bags until they went into battle and then they were just bullet stoppers you can't be much more disposable than that I know by the way that is a really good memoir despite Babchenko turning out to be a complete loon but you know he has an excuse he fought yeah yeah when you get punched in the head for eight hours a day every well more like 20 hours a day every day yeah did of Shina plus Chechen war equals you know understandable mental issues but one read of this is also is that well look I have to me it doesn't seem like we're talking about anything like Stalin, Grativer, Dune, you know numbers like nowhere even in the ballpark based on just everything I've seen from the people that that have sort of you know talked up their sides or you know gains of the other sides losses everything still seems to be fairly small scale I like I don't see you know 100,000 on each side sort of thing at all oh absolutely not when you compare this to the great and I mean that in terms of size great battles of World War II it's striking how poorly 21st century states mobilize people yeah with the possible exception of the Horn of Africa because Ethiopia, Eritrea and Tigray have done a really impressive job of mobilizing their people unfortunately that just led to awful lot of deaths but as as states they're they're doing really well and Russia and Ukraine both come across as kind of aged depressed states that can only bring a small number of people into battle and someone unwillingly at that yeah it's it's remarkable these are demoralized states yeah and you know I've seen talk and I think this is one of the examples of it that for example Russia because Russia by the way Russians and pro-Russian commentators or bloggers have also said for us Bachmout is also an attracional battle like this is also where we're actually killing Ukrainians and wearing them down so that when we're hollowing them out both sides are saying that about Bachmout and you know there just seems to be some truth to both sides to it but it's it's really hard to see I don't know what the next step is I mean I you got to assume at this point Russia is going to take back everybody pretty much agrees of course there could be some miracle here or whatever but everyone seems to agree that eventually eight months now plus Russia is going to take all of Bachmout right now they've taken I don't know at least half of it and almost yeah the Ukrainians are saying this too yeah the situation in Bachmout as far as I know right now is that Russian forces have surrounded to the east the north and the south the only way to resupply Bachmout for the Ukrainian side is from the west and they're in artillery range the whole way so a lot of people who are in Bachmout clearly would like to withdraw but it's become an issue with national honor for their leaders and it could lean to encirclement and a lot of prisoners or just a lot of dead kind of like Mariupol at the end yeah yeah it could it could lead to that there have been other issues too I've seen like a pregozion of Wagner has been complaining that the Ministry of Defense several times and his people complaining that the Russian Ministry of Defense isn't giving them enough arms and the idea has been okay well to take severed our doneettes can lisi chants the Russians saved people but expended an enormous amount of artillery and other munitions so now they're just expending expendable prisoners people and trying to save some of their munitions that are dwindling and on the on the Ukrainian side there's seen yeah there's a lot of talk and who knows how much defense contractor economics are involved in this that Ukraine is suffering from a tremendous sort of of artillery rounds and the EU needs to start making more artillery rounds for Ukraine yeah but again it's one of these stories where I'm sure there's some truth to it we just get we get whatever we're served you know whatever whatever we're served from that and certainly on the Ukrainian side there's been really good operational security in terms of information in the West everybody in the West is for Ukraine nobody wants to be seen as helping Russia and so they're maintaining you know informational silence as well so we don't really know and yeah it's hard to trust what you get from the Russian side it's hard to trust what the Western or Ukrainian analysts say about Russia it's just hard to know and you can only kind of see bigger picture things I do think one thing that is going to be something to look out for is that the the idea with among some Ukrainian thinking is we're going to make Russia pay as much as possible for eventually taking buckmoon okay they'll eventually take it but they'll hollow out their forces again just like after taking civet or done it's going to listen chance last June and July making it easier for Ukraine to do a really big successful counteroffensive you know after the spring rains kind of die down and but you know there wasn't a there wasn't a mobilization and we don't know how large Russia's mobilization was but it was at least a few hundred thousand people and you know I've seen stories and it was confirmed even by the economist I've been seeing this for a while from Russian media a Russian account but now it's confirmed even by very pro Ukrainian media that the Ukrainian recruiters have been going around literally dragging people off the street anywhere they can't males I mean males of fighting age dragging them against their will it's not a good site no and if you engage in that sort of shanghaiing of reluctant conscripts and putting them into attritional traps you're playing a really crude arithmetical game and the larger population assuming that the coercive powers of the two states that are fighting are roughly equal the larger state will eventually win because they have more counters to give away those being human lives whether it's going to come down to that I don't know but yeah yeah that it seems like a bad way to play the game but I don't know how many choices they have either yeah yeah that's that's the thing and they need as much western it as they can get yeah and last thing Bill Burns they had a CIA the former diplomat I saw where he said today he said today that as he understands it Putin is thinking okay we're in this for the long haul and this is going to be a long war and we have the overwhelming resources people and resources and the will to stick with it you know as long as possible to wear out the other side and the other side will eventually wear out I think it's a pretty fair assessment and you know it fits with the Russian way of war I mean that was kind of one of the takeaways from when we did our church and war series like yeah they suffer enormous setbacks they do some just incredibly horrible stupid protest mistakes but they don't quit necessarily either even when they quit they don't quit yeah as long as the state coheres yes it will probably prevail and it will in the American phrase win ugly really yes but there's also a strange mentality in the west or the suburbs of northern Virginia or whatever you want to say or the home counties of England which is yeah and increasingly you know in wherever the German and French government elite hangs out too that this is all important and we're now re-energized and ready for war again coming out of that long post 1945 pacifist phase well it's more or less and if Ukraine collapses they might do something to prop it up and it might be something very dramatic I agree I mean they say over and over that whatever this means that Russia cannot win then they say they Putin cannot be seen to have won there cannot be the impression that it is anything less than a failure and a loss which presumably means yeah that's when you get these quicksotic Verdun situations like when when it becomes an issue of national or in this case international honor that can cause really stupid bloody things to happen yeah I think that's the best we can predict because we don't know if Putin's strategy or NATO strategy is going to win out but I think we can pretty fairly predict ongoing bloody you know gory horror show over you know smaller tracks to land yeah and what the last thing I wanted to say about this is the the media in the English language anyway is so obsessed with this war to the exclusion of you know Tigray and Ethiopia which well that's another issue that there's a saturation of news and you get the sense that events are happening there in Ukraine in buck mood in fact nonstop but when you stand back and look at the map there have been there was the initial Russian push when it looked like they were going to take Kiv and they didn't and since then there was there there really have been two big changes of control the most dramatic one was in Karkov or Karkiv when Russia as far as I can tell just left one century per mile along the front and diverted all the troops to the southeast so that Ukraine was able to take back a large chunk on on the northern side of the battle front very dramatically very quickly and then there was Russian withdrawal from the west side of the river to the east bank and that's it in Kyrgyzstan. Other than that there's this crescent of occupied Russian territory that hasn't shifted that much yeah no you have to if you're a real war follower and there are a lot of those people it's all about villages and settlements you know like these aren't even and there's like 10,000 villages in Ukraine I'm sure Russia too called Pervomyska or Bihlohorska or you know so but first of May it's funny they still have that there being anti-communist or Bihlohorski which would be white white hill tons of them and you get a mixed up wait which Bihlohorski is this which which Pervomyska is this but it's all it's like sub villages they they call settlements it's like some some farm or something you know and and that's what people will be obsessing over for months and yeah yeah I think it gives people the wrong idea and the videos do too like this is a really dramatic video game war of tanks blowing up and all that but it's really not it's a very slow yes muddy meat grinder of a war yeah they both seem to try to avoid you know the big battles like which which is smart you don't generally want although if you're invading anyway we've already talked about a stupid invasion was but at this point you know it doesn't happen very often there was a moment there was an instance about a month ago when there was a big push stupid push from what the Russians say by Russian I think it was Marines in Vuhlodar where they were at again put out into a huge wave of armor and infantry and open fire the wave of armor it's bizarre why did they try that it's not gonna work that's pretty clear by now yeah it's just amazing and yet it doesn't lead to anything one way or the other didn't lead to the collapse of the Vuhlodar and I didn't lead to anybody getting lined up shot you know for failing it's just oh yeah well let's not do that again for a while anyway I want to get to our discussion enough with the war with Sopo Jeparides say to talk about what's been going on in Georgia lately and and just the whole general world of politics post-Soviet politics NGO colonization and the whole all thing not as violent but pretty damn sad anyway so let's get to our discussion with Sopo Jeparides say okay we are very honored to have with us our guest today to talk about Georgia Sopo Jeparides day I hope I pronounced it properly Sopo is a labor organizer and activist based in to Belisi Georgia she's a co-founder of the Solidarity Network Workers Center and is the coast of a really great podcast reimagining Soviet Georgia first of all welcome to the show and thanks for coming on Sopo thank you so much for having me I'm happy to be here brief plug for you guys for your podcast I mean you guys recently had on Vladislav Zubok who wrote this great book collapse that we've talked about a couple times on this show yeah and that's a great get I think I mean his book is his book is a really important and you know pretty jaw-dropping book to read it's a great book yeah we have a study study group around it right now we're reading it together and it's one of the most depressing books yes yes I know I know you're reading you're just like do something you know and he's like no no no I don't know I read somewhere in Lenin I'm not supposed to do anything here and it's just it's pretty it's sad I mean you know he's you can't accuse him of bad intentions but that doesn't mean the outcome wasn't pretty awful but yeah it's a frustrating book I don't know I among George you know Georgians are young Georgian leftist it must be a surprise in for other reasons because I imagine the general narrative out there is I mean what it's probably very very anti-Soviet and very anti-Russian probably anti-Gorba Chav and so on so you know and Gorba Chav just comes off as just I mean the whole party just comes off as so dithering and feckless how are people reading it there so our study group is actually of international we have lots of people so we have like four Georgians in it and we're all just like but I mean everybody who's reading is already like a socialist or at least is interested in Soviet history in a much more complex way than just screaming anti-communist slogans like a lot of people too yes so yeah I think it's a Gorba Chav is not really talked about very much on a general level everything is really talked about it a lot a lot less nuanced ways like Soviet Union is one thing you know that there was in Soviet invasion you know Stalin was a murderer Russian occupation and they kept saying like the last few days as well never back to the USSR they're trying to Sovietize us we're going back to the Soviet Union I was like if you're going back to the Soviet Union I was like please let me know but but just can't they don't understand any of the content is just a like they think of it as an a regional project project of territory expansion like nothing about the content and it's been like 30 years of China convinced people the Soviet Union's bad and the fact that they're still fighting so Union 30 years later just talks just just really actually is a testament to the power of the Soviet Union right as opposed to the Russian Empire or something but the the Soviet Union I mean the people I knew who are from Georgia from the older generation they're great people and I loved I just got to say I love Georgia I've been there a few times and just and had friends from there and just always love Georgia a lot but they the older people would just sort of say they look they were they were pretty anti-Russian but they were like basically we had a pretty great in the Soviet times we had a better than most Russians did you know and yeah Russian nationalists also say that like yeah that you come across that again and again like oh how come the Georgians have it better than we do under the Soviet Union which by the way Zubok made sure to also tell me that like you guys weren't that poor we were I mean I don't know how much that is still around as the older generations dying off do people have any memory of that at all or is that yes no no huge memory people love the Soviet Union it's just that that's not the people who love the Soviet Union are generally not English speakers or if they do know some English they're definitely not on Twitter or right right but there's like a million Facebook groups about you know great Stalin hundreds thousands of likes to they have all these like when Tply sees to be relationships that's what they call Soviet times where Tply sees to be relationships it means like people are so kind to each other there's solidarity that no longer exists right to look how beautiful and green Tply C was the Soviet Union so it's this a lot of love for the Soviet Union culturally and environmentally so on but they some are explicitly like I love the Soviet Union some people are they don't say explicitly but they love they sort of fetishize the aesthetics and so on I see how does that I will get to all this but I'm just curious what we're on the subject how does that manifest itself at all in in political culture or does it not because it's at the sort of elite level it's just verbodan or something at elite level you have to hate the Soviet Union yeah you have to constantly say like the government opposition everyone has to write 1923 you know invasion like whatever and so plus Georgia had the first republic which is social democrat the menchivic government right and so now there is even that was kind of forgotten but now it's being looked upon as look we were independent and we did have socialism and that's by a very small percentage of people actually talk about the first republic but really mostly they focus on first republic as an independent sovereign project anti-Russian that was crushed by the biggest Russians uh right two Georgians so it's like completely contextualized like you can't even if it's so it's so volatile that I came and say like that's actually a false narrative 100 percent false narrative you know um and so it's it's difficult to navigate this rabid anti-communism that's being taught at every level and through schools and universities and in NGOs where you work and in the streets and your movements their opposition movements are being financed they're explicitly anti-Soviet they have come up with the slogan to rally the world around I mean their young kids around never back to the USSR so like people don't even know what that means they just it's kind of become like Nazism like they don't most people don't know what that is they don't know if they're over two but they like know that's bad and that's kind of at what level it is so if anybody's trying to research it think about or talk about it is automatically like touching some taboo and they miss not be trusted I see that in the way some people in the NGO world Georgian and like foreigners in the NGO world interact with you like very hostilely because it's a tab you say taboo things but taboo things that are probably a lot more commonly held just not in that particular layer absolutely that's exactly I'm bringing in you know the opinions of taxi drivers of of janitors of you know of people who live in in the regions like I bring in the kinds of discussions that are much easier had in those contexts I bring them to Twitter and the people in Twitter are the most generally the most pro-western hate USSR either are younger or may not young but just like dissident types that or have from their identity around hating the Soviet Union so of course they're going to be really hostile to me and also very nationalist like yes every possible I mean they just in the foreigners are actually the worst the foreigners that live here I see I see all they want to do is get the most outrage by you which is really funny it's like you're a Georgian they're not and I notice it's usually men in NGOs foreign men and NGOs who get most outrage by you yeah absolutely absolutely that's because first of all they're mostly always sexist that's another thing that's really funny to me is that they really don't even realize it because these are these the people they're pretending to be this western like vessels of civilization generally don't even have basic feminism 101 down because they are not at all and even the woke stuff that's happened in say the west there's not filtered down to them they're like straight up old style like right you know sexist racist yeah and so they're even think about these things that like all these like NGOs and so on at least like have this culture of like oh consider she's a woman and she's like from there whatever you know they only will mobilize it if somebody else does against someone like me never defense of me of course right but they're you know at the end of the day we attract really bad people because because we're a libertarian like we're considered anti-Russian libertarian paradise so you're gonna get those people here you know Cuba attracts different kinds of people right right absolutely I said to you briefly and in sort of when we were preparing the show that I met years ago now I was in Georgia and I met I interviewed Kaka Ben and kids they so he was a at that time I think the rich richest Georgian or aside from Badri and Ivan Ishvili but and he made a lot of money in Russia joined the Rose Rose Rose Rose Revolution government of Sia Kashfili as the economy minister I believe and I interviewed him in his office it was like it was a very kind of you know more old school soviet sort of office very unpretentious he was very unpretentious very just a very nice huge dude I think he died young like huge giant hands very soft spoken and then I looked on his wall and I mean I already kind of knew about this and was writing about it but it was just a kind of a shock to see I hadn't really seen that out in the FSU these awards and citations from Heritage Foundation and Kato Institute praising Georgia's labor laws which you know is just it's like total recall on Mars stuff I mean that just means total open season on on Georgian workers right I mean stripping all the labor laws from the Soviet era I imagine yes and I mean that was seemed like priority almost number one when Sakshvili took over yes so Sakshvili took over in the beginning in much more pro-state protectionist maybe even in the beginning but then soon after I mean you have to also imagine like we are the product of our times right so Sakshvili takes over during the Bush era war and terror right so he is fundamentally shaped by that this flag with the crosses comes from sort of the crusader flag to go along with the war and terrorism to signal hey we're not Muslim like we will fight Muslims with you yes I remember seeing that flag and I was when the Rose Revolution was happening to I'm starting to sound like a CIA guy who starts popping up anyway I was there during that and Georgia had a different flag under Sakshvili Nazi post yeah that was the socialist flag actually the socialist flag so that's why right so they had this like crusader you're exactly right a total crusader flag and that but that was his party's flag I thought it was it just the nationalist flag no this is the flag of our country now yeah yeah is the crusaders flag and and it's you know the whole war and terror and then he also even like helped with some missions around some Muslim areas in Georgia and of course back then Russia was also the friends of the U.S. they were also doing war and terror and doing all together right they were part of the same same crew yeah so then I'll then after a few years I think Sakshvili knowing that you have to be in lockstep with the West and the way it was was much more these and the Republican party types always sort of welcomed him in more right yes and because they usually did the fault anti-Russia parties things have changed but they really were the more the Hawks and yep and and Bendu Kizisar comes and he brings in and so he changes to much more libertarian and he and they also know that their time might be up so in like 2010 they come up with a they literally say this we will come up a straight jacket for Georgia's economy so that the people afterwards the government afterwards cannot do much so they put a straight jacket in the form of no new taxation and progressive taxation is not allowed by the constitution oh they made it a constitutional yeah pretty much of flat tax and consumer tax so workers just pay twice and nobody else paid anything and so and then they got rid of the labor inspection they got rid of occupational health and diseases they got rid of the labor code pretty much it was just like whatever you to agree that the employer and the employee so they have at will employment they did exchange the government change to dozen thirteen but by but for like good like about 10 years there was absolutely no light labor protection and even now it's still very very weak because it's like trying to recreate it and then also like there's no more tracking of diseases so people get sick from work you can't really do anything much about it labor inspection just started like a couple of years ago any power to even check labor rights and so there's no you know unemployment insurance there's no maternity leave there is no there's barely a pension it's like really really tiny amount there's no many well within the Republican discourse in the US at least NGOs are usually seem to be liberals so have NGOs done anything about this so the NGOs in Georgia formed really coherent around Sakashiri's time periods the NGOs are 10 towards the right way they call themselves liberals but Georgia and Russian liberals would say they're not like American liberals they are right wing here like their neoliberal liberals like like libertarian people don't okay people think neoliberal means neo conservative so better to say libertarian liberals right in terms of their politics I mean very right wing economically and and and maybe in terms of some other areas more liberal in the way we know it like elections or something right yes and also like most of the focuses around like if it's feminist they're gonna focus more on just violence and and and and like reforming the police and not about and also like you know girl balls kind of politics right like getting more women in high you know high positions but like I have never seen them fight for workers rights like I've never seen fight for wages to be higher I mean the main ones don't of course there's always an outlier here and there but I mean labor and I really don't see any of them and so there's a few NGOs that formed that will do like legal aid for workers and when labor inspection was being funded to to form because it was it was gone for years you know I low had put in millions of dollars and other you know other money came in to make this happen and so they would they would finance NGOs to then keep the government I would say accountable at least like monitor them that they're actually implementing it and just go there and just like be like you are not sticking to the plan of you having this and this by this time because that's what NGOs function really is right I'm on the project come in and they will give money to NGOs to then act as their non-governmental arm or whatever directives or whatever negotiations recommendations that the government has taken upon itself to do and so the other for usually foreign countries that's why this whole law thing happened are the ones keeping taps on the government through the NGOs. Well so that brings us of course to what's gone on particularly in the last week I'm sure it's the culmination of a lot more that's been going on but can you just sort of briefly describe it you know it looked like it looked there were some parts of it that sort of reminded me of the Rose Revolution including like the Storming of the Parliament but can you describe what the protests were about you know is this a color revolution is this an NGO? Revolt pushback or like what's the big fight about and where's it going? So since I mean there's already always tension and opposition continues to try to paint the government as pro-Russian and it's not pro-Russian it's just that golden standard is to be aggressively anti-Russian so if you are not aggressively anti-Russian you are then by default pro-Russian so they wanted to and during this word became even more apparent right the Baltic you saw the Baltic nations and Paul did on taking these really crazy hard lines right like to a point where like not letting in Russian or express hum and like just making these insane like statements they're just that just you know very very right-wing very easy and so Georgian government wasn't doing that and that was another reason that they thought that this is a pro-Russian government because if it's not actively going after Russians as Russians then it's because they let in Russians fleeing mobilization yes that is exactly what Putin would want I mean I thought Putin would want them to be deported back and thrown into the front lines but right well there was like even a couple of examples but this has been also ongoing and it's very also I would say it's more typical than some kind of an aberration of pro-Russian is that like some some journalists have reported they were detained who were like liberal journalists from Russia and so there was these but mostly I think that was a lot of I would say that was just sort of making a you know making a bigger deal that really was but that's what they're always like highlighting so this is you're trying to sink your opponent right so of course that that strategy I mean I have learned more real politics being in Georgia and I have ever had in living in the US like US doesn't have that kind of real real politics of taking each other out like I mean that's happened a larger scale but I'm talking about like my vicinity right and like and so the opposition just every single thing every day they just look for anything that can manipulate into a bigger story or a bigger attack everything so they have tons of people working on it so of course everything that's been highlighted is always something that the Georgia Dream made a mistake or did something for me it's been really interesting to see a non-left this government being attacked like this to be overthrown like yeah like I like assume it's like leftist governments but no like but this is a region where even non-leftist get can get taken out so they're not they're super right-wing you know Georgia Dream as same politics really just a slightly less zealous neoliberalism you know they're just like okay we'll do neoliberalism but like we're not like fanatical about it you know yeah and the other one no we're fanatical like yeah well often you can be accused of not being fanatical enough exactly cobalt or mccarkey is exactly that's suspicious not being fanatical or being reasonable is suspicious especially with the war in Ukraine we saw like the invasion started and if you had like you couldn't really speak anymore right because all of a sudden you couldn't question what the situation went up to it you couldn't question anymore because that was not allowed and so like you have then you have to wait for moments right when you're allowed to speak again and this is really except in this part of the world it seems like you're not allowed to speak all the time because there's some crisis taking over and you're marginalized and they're very you know aggressive about it so there's like not a lot of like even like media let's say there's no Georgia there is no media let's just let's just let's just let's get that over there if I can what when you mentioned the twitter which is mostly in english language medium is also the elite medium for for world linguistic reasons is there a strong alternative media in Georgia or in Russian I mean does does Russian survive as a common language of polemics and how does it compare to Georgia a lot of people speak Russian especially the older generation and they don't speak English they don't get access to anything in english you have to also imagine that world and so I don't at least speak Russian very well I speak a little bit I understand a little bit so like I rely on other people to tell me if they're listening or what they're what they're doing with Russian media but like it's like they will tell me like they'll send me like YouTube videos you know like listening to a lot of you know Russian intellectuals say about a specific topic say like even Marxism or communism or I know people who are like sort of anti-communist like hipster who love like the free market and they love you know like these like free spaces and like you know hubs or whatever and they listen to all these Russian like entrepreneurs tech guys in Russia yeah and they like and they're actually much more I mean George okay the problem is the the Georgian version of everything is really just of the version of Russian like I realized this a long time ago it's there's it's so similar and like everything we adopt from Russians they just we don't call it that because the Russians actually are just like US it's a huge country which is much more vibrant has many more people types of people and actually adapts things faster and a bigger market so a lot of things go there and then comes to us later right and it was just funny because there was like these Jordans were like aha Starbucks is leaving Russia now and I'm like I'm like you've never had Starbucks like Starbucks never came to Georgia the Platonic Starbucks the ideal Starbucks yeah yeah it was just funny that they were like happy about Starbucks leaving and they've never even had a Starbucks like do you even realize you know it's one so it's like yeah but it's it's just I don't know it's just so much stuff like so many things that just keep occurring there it's just really hard to deal with the insanity so anyway so there's this whole anti-Russian thing that's always on the back burner you know there's always organizing around anti-so union anti-Russian like nationalist history completely like warped there's a sov lap that only does pretty much like where did Stalin shoot people in the tour of where he shot people you know it's like and like every story that ever said has to be till you know has to be spun in the most anti-soviet way they've never done objective research so and they get all the money anyway like every single fund will just give them money because that's just what they do they don't really care about the truth and so and also actually works in their favor yes and so there's like tons of money put in to show stories against the soviet union stories of resistance right I got mad about this like there was some kind of like soviet union hated the church but people still tried to like find religion and they target the church and call them backwards but then people found a way and I'm like are you gonna tell the truth how the church or the religion was backwards like are you gonna also talk about not just the resistance but like it really wasn't it could be reactionary like institution that was combated and like and now like the same liberals that hate the church now are the ones fetishizing like people loving the church like a hundred years ago like come on right and so it's it's all the time so it's on the back burner and also like I was actually kind of stupid because I was like why are they using the Russian thing at first like calling everything Russian log because usually what they do but then I realized that they were really trying to get the attention of the west it's like oh because they everyone understands Georgia only in those terms right and yeah yeah and and it's way of raising money it only has to do with countering Russia and yeah so yeah that makes a lot of sense we should just say real quickly for people who don't know that the political situation in Georgia I mean the Georgia has been ruled predominantly by the Georgia dream party since 2012 that is founded by and basically still led by the richest oligarch in Georgia Ivanishvili what's his first name again bit? Bicina Bicina yes and he ran against it split away from because he used to be a supporter of Salkishvili as far as I know from Mikhail Salkishvili's party which is now the opposition the United National Movement which is the opposition it has been right since 2012 and so those are the two when you when we say the opposition it's the party founded by Mikhail Salkishvili who's currently in jail with her you know dying apparently in jail he had to flee and uh uh uh shortly after he lost power uh you know murder scandals corruption scandals and so on he went to Ukraine famously and then tried coming back but anyway so so the opposition I mean Salkishvili's party even back in 2003 and the Rose Revolution was always just you know extremely anti-Soviet and extremely anti-Russian and very pro-nato uh more than anything pro-nato I would say so then when Ivanishvili came to power in 2012 he basically ran as like a moderate Salkishvili if I remember I mean pro-you pro-nato pro most of the same stuff but but softening it like as I read the brought back universal health care that was killed by Salkishvili and a couple other things I mean you've described some labor laws some you know slightly softer labor laws that Ivanishvili's party brought back in so they're just basically like a softer version not as militantly anti-Russia not as militantly sort of libertarian but roughly basically in the same space it's kind of like Democrats Republicans or something I don't know is that right? Yeah that's steroids right but yeah that's actually he ran on opening up factories so like this idea that he's gonna bring manufacturing and ran on health care and so it was like social issues and actually they're very not that many leftists really were here but a lot of leftists dissolved themselves and like went into his party thinking that he was going to be some leftist I'm like really he was an oligarch like I just don't I didn't see I like I saw this very clearly from the beginning when I got here I was like this is not gonna work and they were like no it's really gonna work I'm like mmm because they thought okay this is really funny they thought that they would have that they were smarter than everybody else and so they were like oh we're gonna have like even though we're a minority we're gonna have like hegemony oh my god it sounds like some of the left here after Biden came to power yes yes and yes and so of course that nobody listened to them and an ex- Georgian dream was just pushing super neoliberal prime ministers at first they just like last two years changed to a slightly softer more conservative guy but who's actually hasn't taken steps to increase more social care and that's just been the first time in ten years you know but before that was like same neoliberal guys were like let's keep the the constitution against progressive textations like every everything is run by these um these right wing economists so like and so they were like it was a large tent you know Georgian dreams a large tent it's not really like UNM UNM is very coherent ideologically right right you know and so they have to die hard and they're like one tough party I gotta say yes yes yes they are like battle ready tested yeah they have like take no prisoners women like like they are very very very die hard and also they also have lots of hatchlings they have a lot of other parties that also have come from them because they didn't you know they start of course when you lose you know how you start fighting and all of a sudden you have like different parties when you're winning it's like one party it's like yes as the leftist like I get all the stuff of my go okay I get what you guys are doing nobody else seems to be like what is happening so um but they have been locked into this battle of they like Georgian dream has been still masterfully seem seem to overcome every single crisis and they have really I thought they were gonna get overthrown a few times but yeah because this like parliament stuff happened a few times where they surrounded the parliament and like you thought that things were gonna get crazy and people were gonna die and then still it didn't happen it didn't happen it didn't happen and then oh what happened a couple days ago actually I thought was the most controlled protests I've ever seen from Georgian dream to before where I thought they had no idea what they were doing and they would just let people do whatever and then freak out at the last moment you know like seem to police like weren't able to deal with the mass protests right this time I was like wow they've really been practicing trained and they had a very different um approach of course that's no one seems to notice notice this because they were not comparing things right they were just like oh they were brutal to us police brutality but I'm like sure I mean it's always that's how you disperse crowds I mean to repress this apparatus that tries to destroy you if you try to like um go against whatever the norm they have set for themselves but comparatively it's I was actually much more cleaner operation I've ever seen from the Georgian dream well in Sarkesh Ville's cop uh uh uh uh right cops I mean they killed people is that recall yes yes yes they were terrifying like if I had to like again I think people are like Georgian dreams just like you and I'm and I'm like oh no no Georgian dreams still cares about uh like keeping people alive and they care more about like making sure they still get into the EU or whatever like but you and I'm like under Sarkesh Ville he's a nutcase like yeah you really don't know what he's gonna do so and I mean he was much more brutal but that's another thing Georgian dream had the luxury of being less brutal because the primitive accumulations are already done by Sarkesh Ville he already put away everybody in jail you know he had cleaned it up for the business to reign you know it's like that Eduardo Goliano quote like people were in jail surprises could be free so it was like that yeah yeah yeah so that's exactly what happened so he already did that so Georgian dream could then just sort of didn't have to be so violent they could just build on top of it right um but you know of course they had because they didn't weren't ideological here and or have a vision um they've been really struggling um no I saw a really interesting I mean I to get ready for the show I watched uh this video of uh Georgian dream the song I guess by Berra uh the song yeah you saw that yeah you saw that yeah it's an amazing video very good in a video way and what it shows is everybody gets a shirt you know like literally everybody gets a t-shirt with uh Georgian characters in a circle that I would guess mean Georgian dream and it's the emblem of the party uh and you know there's this one sad young woman swinging on a swing set in a park all alone another young woman shows up with two shirts and she gets her one shirt and they they run off and they join a gang of attractive young people and they're all in these shirts sharing sharing the wealth the t-shirt wealth yeah it's uh the the beatina has like two kids that one of them is like a rapper it's it is like thing that culturally I feel like it hasn't been as it's important maybe at first it was I think when the head Georgian dream had more libbles that supported them but over time it's like decline because liberals have all left uh the Georgian dream like anybody who's there's no one no one left on their side anymore that's a liberal really so did the liberals all go back to the former party of soccer chivalry to united movement well the problem is because all those other parties also are terrible oh um they are some of them are back there some of them just just end up being on the same side or some are just holding holding for something better um but right now the opposition I would say is in disarray there's no one really to vote for there's no real party so I think the some some leftists are going to try I can already tell them together 24 you know like the leftists are trying to get there are people in the leftists I mean are like Euro Socialists you know like who love Europe and they're like right have a little social democratic types social with social democrats in Georgia the social democratic party the ones that were in in a Georgian dream are actually less like that oh oh they're a little bit more hard hard harder left okay once we really don't say their social democrats but like left in different ways are tend to be a little bit more or the ones like it work in NGOs but they consider themselves left or their academia they're sort of the love AU and um you know it was just nice to write bikes and like it would be nice if like you know the people were like we had some basic guarantees but they really think that these guarantees like social security is just like legislative you know like right you just legislate these things because there are a lot of them are also like lawyers and they don't understand that like the economy also needs to be like restructured yeah yeah and restructured and like be able to support those things so it's not like oh Georgia could I mean we could get like minimum wage laws like tomorrow but that wouldn't really change anything they don't have enough money to pay people and if if the minimum wage was not also substantial in a way that made a difference so like my biggest arguments are always whenever labor issues and I've had with every single NGO it's ever worked or anything it's like last time I even boycotted their their like EU like we're trying to do labor reform because I'm like this is bullshit they voted on everything that no one cares about and they said they made reform and I'm like I have to face like our members and tell them that oh look we did all these reforms for like two years I was in committee after committee and how is it going to affect you oh wait it doesn't like it doesn't actually substantially change your life and that's my biggest beef with all the labor and geotypes the end of the day they just care about these these you know having some plan like road map and some markers met more than the substantial stuff because they don't actually work with workers like we do they don't have to answer to the people they're supposedly helping a representative no and they also just like the workers for them are like just like stand behind me when I talk to the media about your problems right I'm like they're just I mean it's so tough down they're all so high article so so who was protesting because the protests were about NGO laws but in the NGO class in a place like George even back when I was there was still it was a a small layer much better funded basically you know I mean better paid basically to BLEASEy based you know I can't imagine it was just it was kind of mind blowing to me that that layer was able to bring out so many apparently tens of thousands of people to protest so I imagine there were other grievances but like what was it about the labor law I mean just real quickly if I understand it one of the laws put forward essentially what where you're gonna have to register as as being a foreign agent or having I don't know foreign sponsors if you had more than 20% foreign funding it was a registration thing but that of course could then lead to other steps and the other law was basically an imitation of the far law in the US is that correct yes yes yes so what brought them out what got them so worked up over this aside from I you know the West saying this is bad because obviously that would make it make potentially harder for them to use their NGOs yeah so I think you know when it first came and people were and I'm talking about NGOs were like there's this law we're gonna be registered foreign agents I was kind of like I get called foreign agent like every day so I was I was kind of confused like why is this a big deal you know like I was kind of caught off guard like and then I realized like oh they're net they've never actually been called foreign agents like this was like something very serious to them you know like all of a sudden just the word agent like foreign agent was something that was very jarring from the beginning and so it was also like a huge hit on their pride right so how they see themselves it's like Savior's of Georgia so this was really like a tack on them and then it was like you have to register if you get 20% and everyone pretty much every NGO gets 100% foreign funding right right so it's like even if you get one like if you feel like oh if you get 1% of foreign funding you still would have to like everybody would have to register like so it's it's a very you know fully foreign funded sector plus it looked like and it is like only targeting media and and NGOs so that's already like no business like nothing else you're just gonna go after this right and so before that source had already reorganized internationally and they had actually changed the the local office here and they were like not gonna fund as many things and so like these these worries were coming down that already money was not gonna be like it's gonna be tight and then on top of that and and plus I've everything set like if you're the we lost like we weren't rejected for the can't-easy status like last year so you can't it it's that is for the EU right yeah so there was a little bit worry there that this is like an outcome like no one's gonna care about Georgia or if they are not gonna be part of some track which actually is true right that's true I mean because it's instrumentalized right like we want to against Russia we want to you know whatever it is plus but it's always this sort of long-term project they can't keep you in the waiting room but they don't throw you to the wolves but they won't give you what you want either so it's this constant you have to wait and you have to wait and you have to wait and this was been going on and so you know donors pretty much said like we're not gonna register us if this law comes into place we're not gonna register us for agents and told all their grantees like everyone was gonna grant from them so imagine the panic oh wow yes and they directly told us like we are not going to find you if we have to get registered and yeah you know so it's it'll be over for you so like so that'll get people angry they're gonna go from there's like cars yeah I was like you know I was like that's fine like I was like I understand like I'm not gonna sign on to anything like that was my position I was the only one like and so like they had this like we should get from every sector so they had like people from you know who are getting like say like special needs NGOs right so having special needs people to video saying we're gonna lose our funding you know they had they were trying to get like they did actually get a labor letter like labor rights is in danger like it's like if like if like and it was funny because like even some people had to like say like this is not correct there were like it's decisive they said the funding foreign funding is decisive for labor battles and like and some of our colleagues were like who signed on to that not not me we're like let's change decisive to helpful you know because it was like yeah this is not decisive like labor is one of those things where we can have we can actually exist without NGOs like it's existed before NGOs like it's called your own funding like you have membership dues and and like it's a different not a whole different thing in NGO so like anyway so it was just like a lot of peer pressure and fear mongering and so once everyone got with like they were gonna lose money it was like careful on panic and then they started getting beneficiaries so of so not just the the ones who the NGOs were getting money but like the heads but they told their workers and the the ones who were getting something from it so they're like you're gonna lose your services as well you know so full on but and and I think you underestimate how much foreign funding is in everywhere like all of academia isn't it people work usually like get like maybe a hundred dollars two hundred dollars as salaries so what do they keep doing what they're doing it's because they're usually part of some NGO or some kind of a project with EU or something that they're getting grants from so the professor may have like two hundred dollars salary but he's in like three different projects that he's actually getting you know maybe a thousand dollars here three thousand dollars from there so that's why he's actually living and he's gonna get tons of trips in Europe right let's face it in an NGO person being ahead a leader a head person of NGO or being like you know someone who's not the lowest wrong worker because they get treated like shit but being like a head NGO is insanely great like yeah like trips all the time you get you know you may get per diem if you go somewhere else you get all this respect nice cushy job tons of money like all these trainings in fancy five star hotels like it's a pretty elite life for the heads of NGOs and academics so that's the other side that no one really wants to like talk about that the people know this you know they call them grant eaters of course they're supportive but yeah I remember I was an East Timor once and you could see the NGOs because I mean it's unbearably hot all the time and East Timor and they would actually go through these crowded streets usually with a motorcycle escort in gigantic blacked out SUVs and it was really like watching the the apex predator move through a school of fish and yeah you could see it was it was an enviable life it was really the upper tier of the city there absolutely I think like it's the middle class here you know the Petit Pujwa is the NGO class and and some businesses you know who are usually tied to NGOs because the people who can go to these like restaurants with these the insane prices are in Georgia are either tourists or NGO people or some in some business but like they're not that much business that many businesses so it's it's a lot of the the NGO crowd and also like media media as I as I said before is I was shocked at the how the media people and the activists they all got together and even formed multiple Facebook groups to coordinate and there one of their things was and it was clear every single independent so-called independent foreign fund immediately which are all getting all these grants the same grants the NGOs are getting you know from the same people that they were just a Russian law on every single post so no matter what was happening they would start with this Russian law is this like I was like everywhere so it was there's no such thing as objective media or some kind of ethical standards right so to refer to it as a Russian law was a choice campaign which they all did and they coordinated because I know so and it was effective it sounds like it was also yeah of course of course that's why they did it and it's like no one of course is going to see a problem with this as well I'm like the only one who thinks that like that kind of media like shouldn't exist where you have where you're an activist media you know like and then there's other media which is controlled by opposition and who's just using all this because they're also getting some money or they might have connections but they're also going to have problems with transparency and and there's a government media you know where is real media there's nothing here there's nothing really nothing there's nothing yeah and that's why you can't really ever get anything that's what I'm like a rarity here because when I speak about stuff in Georgia like no one says what I say and because no one would be able to like in that class yeah no one would because like I have I know because I have seen where um I liked something on Facebook I had just gotten small money which I wasn't even getting paid just to make this book about women workers but interviews are printed and I won't say which organization um they I liked a video they saw me on Facebook Facebook is a weird track and then I was confronted by the donor um why I had liked the video she's wow and then she just didn't do anything and just stalled for almost a year wow just to drag it out and punish me so like and I've had like multiple like I don't have like a lot of money so I don't really have like too much you know too many experiences with donors but like this is what what happened and this is what happened this is small like this is a small scale that I'm talking about yeah so there there are probably a lot of people who hope to get that kind of money even if they don't have it now and they would also join the demonstrations because they aspire to it even if they don't get it now I guarantee you me not going to the protests I am blacklisted like I I know for sure like no one can convince me otherwise that I'm not blacklisted it's it was the rhetoric that came at me at my union like was I was confused and confronted on Facebook but other people how we were silent or we were not saying enough like this was a a powder game so if we were getting pressure like this imagine what everybody else with no politics or no ability to defend themselves was getting and this was happening everywhere so of course and plus the fear of losing you know their jobs people probably don't even think about questioning it it's like this is this is how I make my money and you know there may be all pro everything about the EU project in NATO and whatever and anti-Russian so they wouldn't even have an incentive as it is to question absolutely absolutely there's no incentive to question and no one actually has an NGO critique I actually thought there was some like sort of you know the non-industrial you know profit like non-industrial it was got non-profit industrial complex you know like that kind of like critique no there's no critique here I thought there was actually for a minute I was like oh no but some left no no no no there was really no critique and the creates my favorite part was like the discourse was how come how there they say this about transparency we are the most transparent in the world like we are the only transparent in Georgia does anything and this is the example we report to the government our financial like declarations and so on we get grants and we write everything we do to the donors like you're missing the key point here the people don't know what they never even thought that it was about the people they were like why is the government going don't you know what we do don't can't you access our our bank accounts and finances and I'm like that's absolutely not what any transparency law should be about and so they were exceptionally uncritical of themselves which made me I think from the beginning very like uncomfortable so like I'm against these these laws these bills because they were wrong I think for the way it was done I would like to see transparency or not in those forms but I could not put myself out there and that kind of rhetoric is uncritical we are the heroes this is anti-Russian yeah like I could I could never ever like betray myself that much to stand under those conditions with the worst big you know NGOs especially one of the most blatant ones which was fighting against progressive taxation right a few years back so like why would I ever do that but there was a pressure that you have to do it and then the academia that's where the kids came so they they were worried no one's going to come to defend us which I was always like yeah no one's going to come defend you but also there's so many people that work in NGOs actually there was still a pretty good amount of people that could come out a number of people come out so but who saved them and really this these protests became huge is because and something we had under you know hadn't thought about really is like academia um um you know it's the professors and the teachers urged their students they canceled classes they had been already teaching them about you know Russia is bad how about socialism is bad how communism is bad you know so they have been constantly keeping them on a steady diet of like hate yeah and so they could just you know just stop their fingers and be like this is what's happening now they're taking away your future your most of those people have never been to Europe let's just say like oh I think like a huge amount of the people that came out or like pro-EU have never been to Europe but they're but their professors probably had exactly because they probably go like multiple times a year so they I think they and then of course they took off and then as usually in Georgia it's like you know you're it's the place to be the protest was the coolest place to be so everyone was like let's just go there when there's young people there fighting a government that's been in power for 10 years it's it's fun when you're young I mean it's exciting it's thrilling absolutely of course I would have gone if I was like 18 I would have been like all day I would have been pepper sprayed and been pictures on myself being like I hate the government police brutality like I would have been to know that I have done all those things you know like of course that's understandable and you know and the but what sucks is that all these young kids are now brought in and just politicized in this in this in this way again which is going to undermine even more I think later on but what can see maybe they just radicalize and they can sort of coheare into better ideology but I don't know I don't think so because the way things are set up you know we can't fight the structural structural things like it is a country that's that's on this that has to constantly balance itself amongst bigger powers you know it used to be turkeys to be Iran Russia so it's been always balancing act between these different empires trying to get in one empire to counter another empire and I imagine different actions use different empires to help fight their domestic battles in a way as well right yes yeah which is classic can you name the NGO that that was fighting against progressive taxation or would that be all the trends perency Georgia is that is that is that is that is that is that I'm sure they probably also funny source funds literally everything from great to terrible you know like right exactly great things terrible things that's a broad source yeah oh so it's not transparency international it's transparency Georgia Georgia and they are they they had like this horrible picture like they did something like our road to Russia like we're going towards Russia and they did this like crazy like civilizational like this is the dark ageatic side I'm gonna go towards like go towards the like go towards the like racist rhetoric scares me yeah yeah normalize it yeah like the national species rather happened in the US too it shocked me I thought you know you're you're not supposed to do the ethnic stereotypes even with Russians oh no that was fun yeah no it's fine yeah yeah no everything is fine now you can do anything yes with Russians or the Russian you know the barbaric ageatics it's it's gonna get worse as China becomes more more kind of starts taking over Russia as enemy number one at Washington's doing that like the xenophobia it's it's gonna be ugly but so when I was there at the Rose Revolution 2003 everything was smaller than I mean you know Georgia has gotten richer and they're probably they're way more NGOs and way more sort of micro centers of power perhaps I don't maybe I'm wrong but back then in the Rose Revolution I was very lucky I was sort of um through a friend I met somebody who was from sort of like a once elite central to Blyse family you know in the late Soviet era and still was connected to everybody in a very cheerful guy and his buddies took me around had me meet everybody as they were meeting and then we go out and you know eat congolian drink I was a person which vodka they drank in Georgia that was only a Russian thing and uh but when I learned then I saw the protest and that was when I first saw Kamara the youth group that was based on Alpore the Serbian group and so I didn't really know who they were except that I recognized the same stenciled fist and the whole gene sharp thing and so I and I asked these guys like so you know I was just doing reporting like why are you out why are you out here surrounding Sheverd Nazis um residents and um you know and and the Bush administration wanted Sheverd Nazia they'd said so publicly they wanted them out they were trying to build this pipeline Sheverd Nazi was trying to play the both sides game and and the Bush administration didn't like that um anyway so I asked these young students and they're just mad like I don't know and so I asked a few more and somebody's like we just got paid like 10 bucks and you know sometimes I read that I read that about like I've read that about you know bad guys right so like if somebody is in a propoten rally or something well they were paid 10 bucks and I never really believed it but I actually met these guys and and they said then they were kind of laughing they were just students who needed some money and it was fun and there was a sense that they weren't going to get bashed like Sheverd Nazi did not um you know unleash the cops on them very hard in the Rose Revolution he was ready to retire almost I think if it if things got too ugly and Kamara was fully funded by Soros or at least largely funded by Soros and basically when I got back to Russia and wrote this up everything was either funded by the National Damant for Democracy or Soros and I have to admit when I was getting the Soros's name like at that because Soros was such a big name an aferious name in Russia in the 90s all that he did to enable Yeltsinism and corruption and the oligarchy and the way he personally profited I mean the whole thing was just so awful I was kind of surprised to see he was even still around doing this stuff but he had he played a huge role in that and and you know that that was an instance of where NGOs were used to actually not just as like a lever of influence or you know it's getting leverage or influence leverage over a government to actually affect regime change and you know not the first and not the last time and so I guess the question here is I think some people are saying oh is this another regime change job I mean some people kind of hopefully like that CNN article oh good another might on and then others sort of on the ante NATO left or like oh this is a color revolution I mean I said before the show it doesn't look to me like a color revolution it looks like an NGO putting you know fight back like really NGOs fighting back what do you think is this a color revolution in the making no but I think that what happened was the first night of the protest so the US Embassy actually decides every single election let's just get that clear and what I mean by that is if there's say like even last election there was disagreement and they were saying that George and Dream had stolen votes and they're fighting between the opposition and position the US Embassy sort of said no George and Dream won this you know the spike irregularities if they if George and Dream I'm sorry if the US Embassy had not set that that would have been chaos and that's exactly where that's what they did in 2003 Richard Miles was the ambassador he was the guy who helped do the Milosevic overthrow out of the Hungary yeah and they said this election this vote was not free and fair and that was it like that's the kiss of death exactly yeah that's a great point so the US Embassy has been so far being like no George and Dream won this and the opposition has had to just deal with it they'd got angry at the the ambassador but they have backed down so what happened and this is why there was police that just like cleared out two nights in a row like insanely was that US Embassy said that night that this is dark day has like risen or something yeah dark day is disbanded on George's democracy yes I saw it it was like a really yes ridiculous statement first of all embarrassing for the US Embassy but so they write this statement and I could tell that the George and Dream and I also took that as a green light to say it's okay to have a coup like that's how I took it George and Dream I think probably thought of it the same way and the opposition was probably very emboldened by it yes so there was a fear that that night would have maybe been an attempted overthrow and this is also why it got kind of crazy or the police and so on and so on over this vote I think that everyone is around really wants and may done I think that's a true thing they're you know salivating for some kind of a made-down thing that just it's really sexy for you know foreigners and journalists but it is really horrific for people so yeah look how great Ukraine is doing today I mean Jesus yeah it's well it's like this there's this fetishization of oh protest and it's like oh yes and really George has had a million protests we've already had one rules revolution we already had our made-down let's say and it's it's it's unstable it is it is every year I'm like ha well I have to flee Georgia will there be an overthrow you know like that is not no I can plan anything because nobody actually knows what's gonna happen tomorrow if something if the smallest thing gets gets blown up to something more serious it's very difficult to plan your life here when you're always afraid of such political instability for me it's psychologically terrorizing and it's for the population it is psychologically terrorizing to constantly feel like you cannot be safe it is not a safe space okay yeah that's terrible I mean really it's terrible this is why no one wants to plan nobody wants to fight for something longer in the sense like work or whatever it is because they're like I'd mostly everyone just gets tired and tries to immigrate get the hell out you know because real problems are here are there like you know our workers who are nurses who are you know orderlies who are sanitation workers like they all have to go to work that night that morning nothing if the government changes tomorrow their lives will not get any better like for sure the only difference between who is in power and the sense of like things getting better and not worse are just like elites you know are people who are already doing well or they can figure that out there it's a it's a battle for resources I look at all this is elite battles and it's an unstable so called democracy which makes which makes it everything worse is the constant intervention by the US Embassy and EU calling us how we are backsliding and then whenever this one company this American company that didn't pay 11 months workers and just like took off they were they bought US representatives to write letters saying that Georgia was backsliding because they were trying to get away right with with uh Georgian government trying to keep them accountable one time they tried to keep them accountable and all of a sudden they had a you know this is this is this is a authoritarianism yes yes and this is exactly what they wrote and then all the media just picked it up and was like oh my god see the Georgian government is backsliding look at all these representatives 11 said so it's really sad I have to say yeah of course we I mean honestly it's just easier to change the US than to change Georgia because Georgia is completely just dependent on whatever the US if things change there then things automatically change here but the NGOs play such a key role in that I mean if the embassy says something that's one thing but it's and the NGO class which is so powerful and not just in Georgia in a lot of places I mean I've read some articles and you know from Ukrainian more you know leftist Ukrainian writers scholars talking about the power of the NGO class I mean even more so now since the war started um and it better than it has but no that's a really good point it's kind of astonishing that the the NGOs and and again I'm I'm stuck in the in the stereotype of NGOs is predominantly liberal that they haven't set a thing about this it sounds like they didn't bother to oppose this smear of the government for trying to get these workers paid no they didn't Muslim didn't it was really this is also like the media too as I said because there's no independent real media is that they uncritically also just publish everything and if if an old political party is also set the same thing and we do a lot of things because a small nation there's like many you know reasons but the outer gaze you know the western gaze or the outer gaze is like many times like ways more than what's happening on the inside so like you could tell somebody like eleven months workers haven't been paid this and that but they hear it's an American company and the American rep writes this and you're and I'm just not as important as them you know they will believe the American American just say corruption and authoritarianism and that's it oh the Americans are right yes yes democracy democracy corruption authoritarianism yeah this is buzzword buzzword I don't if you don't mind I want to just read this bit about NGOs I mean this is the subject we did a two-part series on the national endowment for democracy which is you know a particularly more somewhat more obviously mostly evil NGO or has certainly been the done a lot of evil around the world and you know sort of the over arm of the CIA is it as one of its founders had called it but I'm just going to read this bit this is written 20 years ago by Aaron Dottie Roy the the Indian writer about the NGO influence in India she's writing about it from a sort of different way about and the NGOs influence on politics you know the whole role of civil society and the NGOs influence on on resistance politics as well if you don't mind it's a little bit long but it's I just would like to get sort of your take on how maybe this does or doesn't apply to what you see in Georgia um uh anyways uh but uh right it's important to consider the NGO phenomenon in a broader political context she wants to be known of course that there are some NGOs that genuinely do good but whatever in India for instance the funded NGO boom began in the late 1980s and 1990s it coincided with the opening of India's markets to neoliberalism at the time the Indian state and keeping with the requirements of structural adjustment was withdrawing funding from rural development agriculture energy transport and public health as the state abdicated its traditional role NGOs moved in to work in these very areas the difference of course is that the funds available to them are a minuscule fraction of the actual cut in public spending most large funded NGOs are financed and patronized by aid and develop agencies which in turn are funded by western governments the world bank the UN and some multinational corporations though they may not be the very same agencies they are certainly part of the same loose political formation that oversees the neoliberal project and demands the slash in government spending in the first place why should these agencies fund NGOs could it be just old fashioned missionary zeal guilt it's a little more than that NGOs give the impression that they are filling the vacuum created by a retreating state and they are but in a materially inconsequential way their real contribution is that they diffuse political anger and dull out as aid or benevolence what people ought to have by right they alter the public psyche they turn people into dependent victims and blunt the edges of political resistance NGOs form a sort of buffer between the government and the public between empire and its subjects they become arbitrators the interpreters the facilitators in the long run NGOs are accountable to their funders not to the people they work among their wood botanist would call an indicator species it's almost as though the greater the devastation caused by neoliberalism the greater the outbreak of NGOs nothing illustrates this more poignantly than the phenomenon of the us preparing to invade a country and simultaneously readying NGOs to go in and clean up the devastation in order to make sure their funding is not jeopardized in that the governments of the countries they work in will allow them to function NGOs have to present their work in a shallow framework more or less shorn of a political or historical context and so on and so forth you know and then she goes into how it depoliticizes resistance with with a few perks um does that resonate yeah 100 percent it's hard to find um good critiques especially in a in a earthier language you know sometimes you'll find them in very academic language but it's it's really hard to find like really articulate critiques of the NGO's political role in everything yeah absolutely it's a really good passage i have to read that i'll send it to you yeah send that to me yeah i think i think i probably read it while back it's been a while that i've read um NGO critiques because i have so many on my own um but also else i really like Samuel Moin's book human rights is not enough i thought that was really really great book we had him on our podcast um and also learning a lot about you know i've done a i did a huge study about health care recently and learning also health care and that was that helped me understand the role of NGOs as well and just the way things are set up and i was reading the reports of iMF reports about the economic structural adjustments and how they would say you have to do these things to Georgia and then they would issue like open calls to the to get NGOs to apply and then to keep and monitor the government to make sure it was staying on course and they got angry with Sherrod Nuzze at the end that's why they got him out because he wasn't doing enough at that point right like he was not moving on certain things and they wanted someone who'd move on those things and then came suck a shrily where he didn't even really need the NGOs he just didn't even more he went over and above all the structural adjustments um so yes i think that's the critique that they know and seems to get they're like with all these things i think because they were going to stop all these services like everything will stop if the NGOs are if this law if this bill becomes law and i thought that was really interesting that really thinks but they're psyche they really do believe that that is the only way you can really take care of people it's like instead of fighting for the government to take on those services which by the way would be with cost less because every single NGO has to have their own overhead cost you know and um fight for grants they spend so much time in trying to get grants write the reports yes oversight monitor and then pay people to do all this it is a huge waste of money it is so inefficient yeah um but it is a way to discipline about who gets the money from the government you know you urge the government to become small so they stop all these like services so who fills in the gap is the NGOs uh and the NGOs and have to compete and only certain NGOs that can win these grants because not everybody makes it and it's a way to discipline them through the market it's like a market discipline because they have to fight for things it's not already earmarked you're gonna get this money now you're never guaranteed more than five months to a year or so so you've to be always like you know looking for money and then you really are um getting a population to have allegiance to those NGOs and foreign foreign funding i mean really that's the thing so you government if the government say to care of people right you need uh a pensioners house being built by an NGO or some kind of donor right you would have the government build it right so then the allegiance would be to the government right now you have some Germans like building a pensioner house and there's a German sign everyone's like wow the Germans are so amazing so you're creating this allegiance within every single which is very smart i'm very smart i mean it's colonialism it's it's formulas of it works yeah it works like people are like oh but the square was built by the Germans and oh the French gave us money and of course they don't know like maybe the French it's also way the Germans and the French get also jobs that right their market it's time you know yeah and and there's so many things between that too like uh how much they restrict a payment for they always say like 30 percent can go to salaries the rest has to be non-salaries that also restrict it a new liberal sense just like the governments they tell them they can't spend more than 30 percent right social spending it's the same thing NGOs because they don't want high salaries like they don't to compensate labor right they want to keep those low to make sure that you're then spending on other things and those other things just tend to be at least in like the to policy circles five-star hotels like I'm huge like yeah yeah i mean it's the very same i would go like the only time i've ever been to five-star hotels here or anything nice has been through some meeting of labor rights you know like wow i mean i've had this woman who's actually very nice but she like took us once even on plane like a like a helicopter as a like a little helicopter ride and it's really fancy hotel like labor rights you know it's like wow but she was like i want the workers to see the the couldn't like the the riches in life you know the workers never seen a five-star hotel we had some like miners come who were like oh my god oh my god yeah of course so it's and then the so then those what happens the active labor people right we'll get we'll get siphoned off into the actual world yes that's what right and then they start yeah yeah and then they start thinking hmm this is a good life maybe i could try to get something maybe i should do this and they start to and and really once you once you get that money like that for it's like the first hit you're gonna want to keep getting that you're like it's such easy money you know what you think at first like it's so like i came and i spoke for like an an hour and i got like 300 bucks like you're like yeah that's easy money i've never got this much money for doing that then you start to be like hmm how can i make this work for me right yes like yeah i've seen i've seen the greatest like people leaders and stuff like fall apart when they see the money yeah that's what right to do it and like people fall apart when they see the money like you have to be some different level of fanatic or crazy person to not be tempted by that kind of money you know and say no to that and you know you have to play nice after that they invite you and they want you to say something they want you to sign something they want you to hold this sign then you start being like well i'm gonna get some money in they're gonna think i'm good and yeah a spy you might not even get the money but they can keep you aspiring to it and that will draw a lot more people yeah and some free meals in the top restaurant every now and then and some parties yeah i mean there's just a whole gradation how that how that temptation works and exactly yes pretty poisonous that's that's too bad so so i i mean so thus far because the latest i saw is that these protesters were starting to say okay kind of mide on like well now we've got the bills rescinded but that's not enough we need to get the resignation of the government but i don't know if that's gaining the same traction it's not it's not what they say yeah okay yeah i think that's always they always try to do that yeah um so yeah that's definitely a way like oh i'm thinking about it like someone had to do that but also the political opposition like didn't do very well in this they were caught off guard and because a lot of students came in new power and also you should have seen like people on Facebook like older people like even my age being like zoomers are so interesting like do you know they do like it was like they were looking at like new species or something and just being like really cringed boomers about it you know and so we're like observing these people and everything they're doing is so new to them you know they're clearly not on instagram and tic dot cluck i am 24 seven so um so they were fetish they're fetishizing oh these young kids they're future and they're gonna and also they do is every time like they're somebody comes they'll say just their future and so on and of course you can't project like people just don't come up with good politics organization just like in five minutes like that's just crazy thinking and they're all gonna be disappointed in two minutes and they're gonna be saying how zoomers really weren't that great i'm waiting for that yes that's the inevitable next one yeah exactly so i'm waiting for those those disappointed Facebook posts but that's but i do think now that the conservatives are gonna try to plan and party the leftists different leftists and triplets and the leftists really weak i say left and i really mean like pretty much liberals like but more leftist progressive types are trying to plan some parties i could tell and so everyone's gonna try to leverage in 2024 because like Georgian dream is looking weak the opposition big parties are looking weak so now some new um you know new blood might might go in but they might also just get completely destroyed we never know because things could change so rapidly it's still a year off so right okay you're gonna have actually well i think this is i mean this has been a great discussion and really appreciate it like i really feel like you know kind of know what's going on a bit better it's um um and it's sad i mean it is i have to say i mean you know i don't know how many of our listeners um have been to Georgia it's just a great country i i've never met anybody who went to Georgia and didn't like fall in love with it um and everything about it just it's a beautiful place the obviously the food is great the people are great it's just it's a great place it's just really sad to see this crap and you just hope one day you know i don't know it can escape this and have some kind of sovereign normal politics to go with everything else but um and uh and good labor laws i mean you know which is what you're trying to work in yeah so um but anyway i really appreciate you taking the time uh to talk to us and good luck with with everything you're doing out there too thank you so much for having me on i appreciate it it's been great thank you so bye bye thanks so bye bye bye okay i think we can end the episode there thank you again so much to sopa japanese for staying up late and talking to us radio warner um thanks
