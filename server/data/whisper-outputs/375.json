    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radial Warner. Today is April 22nd, 2023. This is Episode 375. On the Ghost Mark Ames in Rochester, New York, and I'm on the line with John Dolan aka Gary Brecher, aka the Warner in a hotel in the South-East-Little-Pocket of the Italian Peninsula. John, how you doing? I'm okay. Yeah. I mean, I'm in Bari because we had to leave one of the weirder hotels we've ever been in for a relatively normal one. I mean, I was telling Katherine, I think I should just write a book about weird hotels I have known and where our latest one would rank because as I mentioned last time, I think we ended up for a week in a freeway side hotel in the middle of nowhere. It's just a giant eight-story hotel by the side of the freeway. You open your window and it sounds like you're an L.A. And there's nothing else around. And I was starting to wonder, why does this place exist? You can hardly walk away from it. You know, it's all for cars. It's as hard to get out of on foot as an airport. And it also has a weird sort of title effect, like most of the time it's nearly empty and then suddenly it will fill up. We had to come into town because we thought after scheduling tonight's show, we'd stay there for another day and it was impossible because a couple of buses all blacked out looking like they had third-stage guild navigators and them showed up out of nowhere and the hotel suddenly filled up and there's no room at the in for us. And we were trying to argue, where does this fit in the scale of weird hotels? There was the afternoon brothel place in Naples with the ancient Egyptian theme. And then there was the love hotel in Toronto, in Albania, where we didn't know in advance that we'd booked a place that would have a neon sign at the head of the bed saying, love, love with a heart on neon heart also. Sexy. Yeah. It was a very definitive sexy. And... Is that near the Airdawon pizza place? No, that was a duress. Airdawon pizza was more of a gritty working class thing and duress was very gritty. Toronto by contrast got a lot of gulf money. We'll be talking about gulf money in the show today, but one place gulf money went was Toronto. I heard great things about Toronto. I mean, so I was there well over 20 years ago and it was pretty alien. And I was used to kind of traveling to alien places. I was pretty alien and point hadn't really had its little post communist boom yet. But not long after that, from everything I've heard it really did, I heard great things about Toronto. It's definitely a boom town. I don't know. We got kicked out of a bus in the middle of town and lost a Kindle in the process, so I wasn't too thrilled about it. But you just drive into town on the bus and it just looks like money, especially for us because we'd come from Macedonia. There's no money in Macedonia. But Albania has had a lot of money and it's a glossy skyline. Briefly before we get to our interview, we have a great interview with Joshua Craze to sort of to talk about the latest events in Sudan and also sort of give us a deeper broader context and it's really fascinating. It's an amazing interview. Amazing. Yeah. But before that, I just want to point out you just put out a great radio warner subscriber newsletter or a May Ardenaad versus Malay and Marxism Leninism. And for people who haven't subscribed yet, if you happen to be listening to this, subscribe at patreon.com forward slash radio warner. But yeah, this is a great newsletter here. You want to just give a brief back to that. Yeah, it's very hard to get information on the wars in Ethiopia over the past half century. They strike me as one of the most amazing stories around. But I thought I would try to find novels about the wars of the Ethiopian derg, meaning committee, meaning the Marxist Leninist dictatorship of Ethiopia in the 1980s against the Eritrea and insurgency. And I found one called Oromai, which had been translated into English and tried to write a newsletter about it. And partly because I was having a lot of health problems partly because of the obscurity of the topic took me a long time to write. But the novel itself is amazing. For starters, it costs the author's life. I mean, like the disappearance of the author, you know, that's something you heard about in English class in grad school. But this author actually disappeared as in he published this novel. They let him publish it at the time. And then as often happens with dictatorships, they decided they really didn't like it that much. And they didn't like the author that much. And therefore his car was found by the road outside Atis Ababa and his body has never been found. It was about Operation Red Star, a massive, very Bolshevik style, military and political and cultural offensive to transform Eritrea and society, you know, with artillery and self criticism meetings and God knows what else. And it was a massive failure. And the author who had an Indian father and an Ahmara mother, wrote an honest account of this of being part of the Hunda that makes the big trip to Asmara, capital of Ethiopia, of Eritrea rather from Adis Ababa. Because Mingi Stu, the leader, wanted every one of his whole group there. They all go there. They listen to four hour speeches by Mingi Stu and then the army fails and the whole thing comes apart. And he tries to be loyal to the author. But he ends up having to say some things about Mingi Stu that Mingi Stu didn't like. You know, he was torn between not getting killed by Mingi Stu but making the novel interesting enough. I'm literally dying for his art. I don't think he expected to die for himself. But must have crossed his mind at the same time. Yeah, the lines that may or may not be crossed now, those lines may be different. A year from now or two years from now. But what I love about this newsletter is the way that Marx, you know, you'd have to have been from this, you'd have to have been somewhat alive from this era. The way the sort of pedantic spats with very serious consequences over, you know, over basically grad school terminology, Marxist Lenin is grad school terminology in it. And it gets instrumentalized by people who don't really give a shit about Marxism, Leninism not much. But the people who do care pretty much all die. They all die. And it's just it's grim. It's, you know, it's grim. It's you can't help it being comical in the way that every dark fate of every. Yeah, it's comical. It's ridiculous. It's heroic. It's bloodthirsty. It's all that stuff at once. But great story. Right. So let's get to, you know, the current story, this, the war in Sudan. And our interview with Joshua craze. We're very happy to have with us today, Joshua craze a writer who's been working on Sudan since 2011 and who's written for new left review, small arm survey and the baffler. In fact, it was when Mark and I saw his article in new left review called gunshots in cartoon that we were really impressed and asked Joshua if he could come on the show to talk to us about what's going on in Sudan today. Yeah. So first of all, thanks for coming on the show, Joshua really appreciate it. So all our listeners. Pleasure. Long time list. The first time caller. I've always wanted to say that. There we go. You got it. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. I mean, it's exciting. We did a show. I mean, I've seen that you specialize. I mean, your research. More south Sudan, right? And I know John is written about south Sudan. I think we did an episode early on in early radio or nerd days on south Sudan and talked about it. That's your specialty more right or is it all of Sudan? Yeah, I mean, I did my PhD on Abyeh, which is a contested territory between Sudan and South Sudan. And I spent much of the last 10 years doing conflict work looking at South Sudan, but I've also been working more recently in Sudan with the riff, I'm just a riff, I'll institute and words, small arm survey. So I was last there in September in cotton. And then I just last September. Yeah. And I was there the year before that in the week running up to the coup. And I left the day before the coup, just like the US envoy. Yeah. That was famous Easter vacations you wrote about. And the whole diplomatic corps was absent. I think this time, right? Yeah, that was this time. Yeah. Tell us a little bit before we go into this about your impressions of court to him. So you've been in court to him primarily post bus year era or were you there? Yes. Yes. Okay. Tell us what it's what it's like some basic impressions. I mean, I doubt very many of our listeners. We have an international audience, but I doubt very many of them have been there. I mean, cartoons are fantastic city. It has some of the same qualities of Cairo that it let you spend. You can spend all night sitting around drinking tea and discussing. Even under the sheer. It was not a dictatorship that like a listenership might imagine, which is incredibly restrictive and totalitarian in controls. All the activities there were these popular committees that ran sort of neighborhood by neighborhood, which tried to monitor for loose women and also determine kickbacks and corruption. But there's an amazing. Just like lively art scene, lively discussion scene. And that was really evident last September that even though we've been like a year into a coup by that point, I was going to art events done by the resistance committees, these groups that were instrumental will largely the force that overthrew the sheer. Massive amounts of discussion that it was a very it was a week, two and a week dictatorship. What was sort of apparent by September was that it was a scruffy and has broken down as I've ever seen cartoon. Right. It's a it's a big urban city. It's seven million. Yeah, it's had a lot of investment in the sort of the second half as it were a Peshira's regime from the Gulf. And so a lot of Gulf money flowed in and really transformed parts of the city. Then parts, it knew absolute slums and totally like sets at centers of informal work. It's a yeah, it's a it's sort of astonishing really to see reports now from what cartoon is and how quickly it's become this. So one of the centers of the conflict is in cartoon, mid name cartoon, too, which is a site, which is along with Amarat, the place where all the international live. A lot of the NGOs are based and they have a coffee shop called ozone. Ozone has sort of water spray, which is sent out over the terraces by fans and those are the diplomats living in this space, which is entirely requested. Really from the rest of the city, so a coffee there costs eight times as much as it does just on the other side of the street. Wow has the best waffles in the world. Apparently this is not true, but that's the client. And there's sort of there was this fictional life in these coffee shops that diplomats had about how the transition was going. What but Han and Hemity were doing and outside of those coffee shops, the city really over the last year has been. Correening from disaster disaster as inflation grows, the economies broken down like really it was it was I mean, Hemity came out as this agreement was signed in December. So Hemity is one of the main two commanders currently struggling for Sudan and said the coup was a mistake. And in some sense is the coup was a mistake even understood like by the coup zone like by the coup because they couldn't manage to in any way protect this economy. So it was sort of a glorious city on the banks of the Nile still with the imprint of the British full of clubs. So there's the railway workers club. There's the national security offices club. There are all these sort of like remnants of a British colonialism. There's overlaid a sort of 21st century golf modernism. And all of that was just crumbling under the coup. One of the events that I don't pretend to understand here and there are many is why the Sudanese elite what you call I think the riparian elite the people who live along the Nile allowed South Sudan to leave in 2011 because that took a gigantic chunk out of the GDP right. Because South Sudan has the oil and that money used to go to cartoon and now it doesn't. So can you give us a little background on why that happened what happened in 2011 why they let South Sudan go. Yeah absolutely. So you have to go back really to 2001. And I think one of the general truths about Sudan civil wars is that they begin and end with shifts of geopolitics and they're transformed by shifts of geopolitics because in 2001 neither side has the capacity to militarily win. The Sudanese army south has control of most cities in the south but you they can't go outside the cities they're in battled stockade towns and surrounding it is the espil\u00e9e the Sudan people's liberation army which is the force that they took over in South Sudan. This was largely I mean there were operations but it was largely to talk to was a stalemate in 2001 something happens in America as we know and the war on terror begins. And there's been prior to that this 10 year campaign in America by evangelicals and senators which is the sort of motley assortment of end of history liberals who believe that they should never have in a row and again combined with the war. Combined with Christian Evangelysis who think that the evil Muslim North is waging a war against the Christian South and we have to intervene and they spent 10 years sort of trying to pressure the US government but it was really 9-11 that transformed the US's perspective on what was happening because sudden of course Sudan was the country that had harbored. Well someone in the modern during the 1990s and so suddenly there was this huge pressure on Sudan and George W. Bush came in and really pushed them along with Norway in Britain to the negotiating table and that led to an agreement in 2005 and but she has the way that politics in terms of agreements is done in Sudan and in South Sudan now is that you make an agreement and all the really difficult issues that just kick down the table. Like agreements are sort of part of the process there's been many many agreements in both countries that are just they're not sort of cessations of war they're themselves a form of war they're a type of negotiation so in 2005 but she assigned this agreement under massive pressure from the international community basically I think with the hope that a South Sudan wouldn't vote to see be we'd never even get there because they would use military forces so they view they're not going to be in the same way as the other countries. So they've used the she has playbook has always been I mean and this is inherited from city of Kalimadi before and other people who've run Sudan to use militia forces to fight wars in the periphery of the country it's a country with an incredibly dominant metropolitan right this riparian elite that I write about in the piece. The rest of the country is fundamentally since the 1970s and the collapse of the economy under the debt crisis and the various oil crises of that period has been like just a ground for labor and for resources to be used by the center and they've pleased it really using the old meaning of police with militias so during the war the people really fighting in the south was not so much the sranan forces but these militias from one of the south Sudanese groups called the Nour which took control of the oil phase. So the people that took control of the oil fields and depopulated them occasionally with the assistance of Swedish oil companies from so they can take control of the. So the hope I think for BC was they would use these same forces and we would never get to a referendum. But the problem is that Kier who then was that we became the leader of South Sudan was getting a huge amount of oil money from the oil. So for off in this agreement called the so when 2005 when the peace agreement signs most of south Sudan is that we're not mostly let's see a third of south Sudan is under the control of this force under Palinum ad-Tip which is a militia force sponsored by Bashir which is not included in the peace agreement at all. So this is immediate crisis of like what happens to a third of the country which is also where all the oil is and what solver does is basically buys them off and integrates them into the army and that lays the groundwork for the civil war in south Sudan in 2013 which basically breaks open that unification but it also means that Bashir has nothing no way of buying out those militias and causing the disturbances he needs to prevent the referendum. Given America's interest right this is like the belated will Sony in moment you know like there was like eras manella writes right about this moment where they could have actually backed self determination and they chose not to here was like a belated self determination right America like consider itself you know the father it was really was incredibly paternalistic to listen to the diplomat in that period and the father of this country they were going to make it happen. And so Bashir basically knew that it was going to happen was unless he was going to cause a sort of international incident that would block his relationship with America he couldn't prevent it so what he tried to do instead was diversify the sudden news economy in the north in the north right okay yeah and so the two things he I mean he did several things but one of the things he did was try to reorientate Sudans foreign policy away from Iran and Qatar towards the Emirates. And Saudi so marine border piece of land the size of Bahrain. There were various like moments of agricultural security with Saudi rebe coming into by land but the other thing he did which is more consequential for Sudans politics is that massive amounts of gold were discovered. And then we have a double problem for Bashir one is the only is there been a war in the south but since 2003 there's been a war in Darfur fought by largely non Arab groups against Arab forces that again Bashir instrumentalizes and turns into militias right now the problem with gold rather than oil especially like low scale gold mining is it requires a great deal of control of territory. And the person who is anointed to control that territory and basically again the police operation displacing rebels defeating them controlling the gold mines is hematee. For listeners here let him it is the leader of the the RSS support forces yeah which is the I don't know which is one one of the two main battle groups right now that are fighting and and sort of the deputy leader of the military dictatorship. That took over in the cool last year so so that's him and so he's him and he also controls the gold I mean there was a lot of gold discovered in Darfur I think I was reading something by Adam twos recently where he talked about the whole Sahel has been kind of transformed in the last 10 years by all these gold discoveries but the main deposits really are Darfur is that right. Yes Adam went to town on as he does in his way on on gold mining. Yeah so they he hematee began as is now canonical law as a camel trader and his camels were taken this is sort of like I don't know how actually true this story is it's too neat to be true. It's a great story though right. 7000 camels were taken by the rebels and thus like without you know his possibility of economic reproduction he installs himself as an amir as a as a war leader for his very small. It's an Arab Darfur group that live at both in Chad and Darfur he has various links to family links to people within the the Chad union administration and he. He then becomes part of what was known as the janger weed so literally evil horsemen and they were the Arab militias used by Bashir to fight the rebellion in 2003 and led to all I mean an endless series of war crimes and sexual abuse and the burning and killing civilians. Many of the janger weed by the time the RSF is created have turned against Bashir. So he's having only he wants rebel against Bashir and basically use that as in classic Sudanese form to leverage his potential rebellion to gain a better positioning government. And so when these groups in the janger we start turning against him start turning against Bashir. He's loyal and so he becomes and is a 90 the head of this new unit called the RSF and there's been like one of the things that Bashir used to rule is that he would constantly make new security forces and he would effectively coup roof his regime by having them set against each other. So the army competes against the national security service run for a long time by Salah Gosh a great CIA ally then there are the popular defense forces then there's the janger weed of musnahelal. So all of these different forces and him and he takes this moment and uses it he creates a holding company on Jeanette his brothers running it to basically introduce himself and go back in the sense to his roots as a trader by being a bizarre trader and expanding rapidly into real estate construction iron fundamentally gold and gold allows him to build a bridge to the Emirates. Right was almost the whole of Sudan's gold goes to jubi right and then he's recruiting this army the RSF and he doesn't stop at Darfur and this bit makes him different to many of the other militia leaders which is he has not just he has a national game he has a Darfur game and he has an international game. So one of the things he does via his emerald connections is send troops to Yemen to fight on the Emirati payroll and send troops to Libya to fight with Haftar. Can you tell us a little about how those troops were used in Yemen and what you've heard about their service in Yemen. There was a lot of losses what interestingly the Saudis that also hired the army to fight in Yemen and the commander of the commander of those forces happened to be a man named Burhan. Already right way back there's the these two guys are sent to this basic like you know externalization of the Sudanese war machine. I mean there was some pretty heavy losses by the RSF and by 2019 there were complaints that it was in Sudan that the RSF was growing too powerful and creating too much of an international scene so after 2019 they pull back how many RSF are in Yemen. Okay yeah that's amazing that that the two leaders of these factions were rival mercenary conditier in Yemen at the same time right. In fact there's that pairing up of you as you say a basic Sudanese strategy so that as as you mentioned Bashir would have expected south Sudan to be manageable because he can play the dinko off the newer but then the dinka leader gets enough money that he can buy the newer at least for the moment. Right I mean I think this is in the sense what we're seeing now is the culmination of Bashir's former rule which is that he's always instrumentalized the peripheries to fight against each other and so there's always been this sort of this like you know if we want to be simple Marxist like if the fundamental class antagonism of the country is between a center which is extractive of the of the resources of the periphery and the peripheries what Bashir's genius was and it built on the strategies of other Sudanese rulers was to set out. The actors in the periphery against each other and what we now have is the peripheral actor that he relied on he could see my my protector has come back to the center and unlike all the other Sudanese civil wars we've ever had this one is happening in cartoon. Notice you retweeted a bit of shounfreude a by south Sudanese commentator who said you know we've with understandable bitterness I suppose we've been a war all this time and now they feel it in cartoon. Yeah absolutely. So first of all your description of him it I mean you know leaving aside the obvious ruthlessness the history of that basically genocide and so on I mean he's he's also like an incredible in impressive in terms of being a genuine self made person he's not from the repairian elite it sounds like but is really quite self made so he must be he must be I don't know. More impressive in a sense than whoever his rivals are is that I mean you say incredibly smart incredibly strategic and I think he's made probably made some errors that you know being photographed in Russia on the day the train station stars was in the good move. Though he has his own you know it will you speak Canadian PR firm now it's a French PR firm that's doing the the RSF's social media which is incredibly is like sort of perfectly in the language of the UN. I saw some of the bombs you like human rights workshop. You know but I think that the important thing there's like he is that and I think that not only is he was he that is immensely disliked by the army elite of the challenge to their economic empire and disliked by the central politicians who look down on him. I think also a degree of that let's call it what it is like racism and classism really infiltrates into the international picture given of hematine right to like every every profile has to begin with he left school at second grade right somehow that sort of disallows him who stirred grade sorry disallows him to be you know a smart intelligent leader and I think this also happens with the question of command and control. There's this claim that the the RSF are not in command and control of their forces one is if south the Sydney army is not many out atrocities everywhere and is not in control right into it and to I think a lot of what RSF is doing is pretty structural and strategic even when horrible and brutal and I don't buy the story that this is all you know like renegades RSF guys no it seems pretty rational and thought through in the many respects I mean I think another way to see it is that the RSF in general are though the now a multi ethnic force around the country is run basically by his clan by his family members and has an amazing degree of command and control. South from the other hand the Sudan armed forces has under one hand but there's also a whole compartment of it which are Islamists which are NCP members so she has party the National Congress party within it and in many ways I think the army is much more fundamentally fragmented right then the then then hematine. Yeah that was an interesting angle that hematine hematine people are now saying and you can tell this was an obvious tactical PR move though it may well be true also that you know he had to step in because the army was trying to bring back those hardcore islamists I mean I was something that will obviously play well in in the west and and as I say may also be true. So there's there's a lot of sophistication in the RSF messaging yeah and it's not in it's certainly not entirely false like after the coup happens is October 2021. The army found itself in a difficult situation because it doesn't really have a social base it doesn't have an ideology which the NCP which the she had did right at least you know for certainly for the first 10 years physical he was ruling in lockstep with the islamists. So then they're like okay how do we run this country under what conditions and they immediately started to look for a civilian head of the government handoff who is the previous you an economist who was running the civilian part of the government came back for six weeks and immediately left again after street protests so they were they needed some sort of civilian compliment and because they didn't find it what they ended up doing was relying more and more on the kazan which is the. So the local name for the old regime. Okay well I think at this point why if you could give us a synopsis of how of you know what led to the events of the last week this this outbreak of what seems to be turning into I you know almost like a civil war. It's certainly you know between the two major military forces but if you could sort of explain how that how it came to be again for listeners so they have a grass a better grass to have what have meant to represent and what a brown represents yeah. So this is going to be like an Eagles view in two minutes and then we can come back to sort of the interesting things. I think this fundamentally is the end game of bishir's regime playing out in the what how bishir ruled is by creating security services so the RSF as we said to run the gold in d'afford from the very beginning they were also used to repress protesters in cartoon and south the Sudanese army which we put up this huge economic empire under bishir what bishir done in the 1990s continuing what Numeric had done before him. It's effectively privatized the state. So they removed the provision of services they gave and by privatize I mean they gave aspects of the state functioning and businesses to selected private actors within the state infrastructure of the security organs so it was a privatization to bishir's friends and he ruled above them and constantly try to coupe her if he's regime by building one up building the other up breaking them down. So under the I'm sorry under the sort of the rubric of islamism of bishir's islamism there was also this sort of substructure of like I don't know a kind of neoliberal privatization of the state. I mean and that's the that the no if you like in boring months it's like the super structure here is islamism of a certain sort the infrastructure is is neoliberal privatization and the use of malicious to rule and to implement the rule of the or like the rule of the state which is violence in all the peripheries. So you know in some sort of ways you could do a much bigger like sort of quince of alien history of neoliberalism in in the horn which said that the place that the police play in places like America are played by malicious structurally not they're not doing the same things but what they're doing is repressing by force of violence. And that's the system that breaks down in 2018 2019 it breaks down because for a long time bishir has as you said not received money from south Sudan there's been no oil coming it there's not being not intervention or money they lost 75% of their income and bishir is casting around he's trying to sell land he's trying to get gold but it's not enough money and so he breaks the thing which is fundamentally his pact with the urban cities of pseudo-bashir so much of sadan eat sorghum or millet not wheat the cities eat wheat they bread and what bishir did was subsidize bread and fuel enormous subsidy to the middle classes but also what kept things alive. I seem to remember that there were riots about the price of cooking oil in the consume of years ago. Yeah I mean this is you know these are protests created by a state which is always in perpetual survival mode and always trying to maintain this transactional machine where it's paying off commanders bringing them in and the system just started to see that. And so what bishir was to stop subsidies on fuel and wheat fundamentally which in 2018 led to the protests and the protest began in the periphery in a magazine in a place called blue Nile spread to this former sites of labor militancy like at barra at barra was the great site of the railway union which was destroyed first by the marion and really by bishir again acting like a good sort of western neoliberal getting rid of the unions in the 1990s like Tony Blair. And then the the spread all across the country and they spread to got to and they increasingly became really powerful at this moment there's the emergence that really there was sort of first form 2013 of resistance committee so these non hierarchical forms of local organization with a lot of socioeconomic demands behind them and then non hierarchical partly to resist the incursion of the national security. So the national security service of bishir which is all over the country and is also an economic empire and a military force and this is the force that really brings down bishir because then the commanders around him including hematine. Realize that in order to save their own economic empires to save the structure of the state is it worth need to get rid of the head of the state. Yeah, he had he had drawn a lot of hatred by that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, right so they hope that they get rid of bishir and then they can re continue basically with the security accounts for the bishir had honesty. I'm a little bit of a cabashi could continue in command and everything would basically everything would change and nothing would change. It's normal satisfied with that so the general who deposed him with hematine's backing even our last 24 hours and the protests continue and in fact they intensify and they lead to a sit in in front of the military headquarters and what we should say here is for people who haven't been to cartoon is that is you're driving in from the airport. It is entirely dominated by this enormous military headquarters and everyone is there red legs so there's the air force and they have a building which is supposed to look like a carrier plane, the navy, they're in a building that looks like an arc. So it's this sort of like magic that's cool winter wonderland of military. Military world. Right and all the kids are outside and they're like working the shut you down and the army sort of plays for time for a while, which is a classic thing that you're doing certain is politics and until they get really scared and they shut down the the sitting and this was caught on June 3, 2019. And there's continual disagreement about who led this but certainly hematine was involved in the RSF were involved in led to hundreds of deaths hundreds of wounded and again didn't rate the street right street protest continue. There was a million man March on June 30th, which was the anniversary of the sheer taking power in a coup in 1989. And then there was a real division between the civilian political opposition in Sudan and the street and I think a lot of the people on the street wanted to have a like strikes I mean protest leading to a general strike there was a small general strike and then there was a plan for a bigger general strike really to insist on the military being entirely pushed out of power. And in the meantime the civilian politicians are kind of worried about the street because they're not they're not personally representative I mean inside this coalition called the FFC the freedom of forces and chain the forces of freedom and change which is the coalition that ends up joining the military and transitional government you have the bathists. You have the naturalists you have like these weird relics. The politics sort of congealed at the last moment it was actually democracy right but they're not necessarily representative but they're kind of worried about the street and they think right I would say they'd be used to dealing with the military but the street is a new force and who knows if you can talk to them. And who is the street I mean is this is it really totally spontaneous and leaderless or are there you know I'm sure they're trying to manipulate the street and they clearly failed but who was the street who were the people were out there was it every class. So the street didn't like yeah once a bunch of different things on that question who is the street was the question that every diplomat has been asking me you know for the best like who what is protest who are street protest. Where is their leader can we negotiate with them why don't they form an organization right and I think the answer is it really varies right because as protests like when all around cartoon you would have resistance committees in neighborhoods like Kalakla which is a very I mean working class like informal class groups of radicals who have received nothing from the Bashir regime. Two places like Woody which is long been a center of middle class radicalism and before that working class radicalism and also like the nicest districts of cartoon whose resistance committees looked and sounded like NGOs. So there wasn't a sort of a I don't think you can give a unified picture but they genuinely were drawn from all the different classes and they were also existing in the peripheries and I think if you were to typify what they wanted and there's been a number of sort of unified resistance committees declarations both then and subsequently the emphasis is really on a transform socio economic picture of what's done is. So not just to change in the form of government in the center but a change in the center periphery relationship questions of like for instance in the fall the question of justice and reparations or like of. Of not retribution but of finding some sort of closure to the horrors of those wars right in places like blue Nile it was also about autonomy and self governance from the center something that that strikes me about all these stories. Is the overwhelming predominance of cartoon as if it were the city but occasionally you'll hear something about other cities along the Nile like Merrow as so is is cartoon that overwhelmingly dominant. In the politics yeah it's the it's like 17th century France and it's in Paris right it is the yes it is the center of the political class and then it has a satellite cities on the remaining sister city across the river and but it really is the place where. Politics is done and the periphery often feels I think and has felt and does feel very far away you know what happens in June 2019 July August is that if you do be uncharitable the FFC the this coalition of political parties and trade unions sold the movement down the river. There was this crucial moment where they could have tried to push the military out I think if you were going to be sympathetic the FFC then they were worried about either a civil war or a bloodbath. If you're going to be cynical about them you say they were actually threatens by the street protest wanted to conserve power and so what you got was this transitional government in 2019 that was from the beginning. And a mess it was a mess in many different way so it had a had a supreme council led by barhan with him it ends up behind is the head of the so don't see his army and his lead and his deputy was him it who then goes out and tries to be the sort of the real statesman in the room as opposed to the army commander and then it has a civilian government that the FFC is appointed led by this man Hamdok this you went trained economist whose first finance man. The minister is taken directly from the international financial institutions right is an a limb of the of the IMF and they sort of give a first speech and they say the central economic question for Sudan is the payment of its debt. Right and the first things that they end up doing really are like they almost like work for international consumption yeah. So there you know know anything differently if they're from that background right right it's the same Washington consensus yet yeah right but now he fails but a later finance minister ends up lifting the sanctions and in some ways you can see them. This is slightly uncharitable but as an intensification of the shares regime right so in just before the coup I would talk to members of the committee so go look it used to be the case that there was a military machine and neoliberal policies of austerity and they were united in the shares government now there is a military machine and there's a civilian government during the politics of austerity and they appear to be opposed and the international military community treats it like this is the opposition but this is a false opposition because they're both actually carrying out different aspects of what the share was trying to do. Yeah you you cited an article by Halood Kair I'm sure I'm mispronouncing her name but about the deep error that the NGOs and the foreign advisors made in assuming that there would have to be a military government of some kind that Sudan wasn't ready whatever that means to transition to civilian rule. Yeah I mean I think from the beginning and so from like from the fall of Bashir the international community has been very suspicious of the street it's non-Iraqqil it's economic agenda does not conform to the dictates of the IMF and the World Bank and they were very proud of their realism and realism dictated that we needed to have an accommodation with the military that would lead to civilian rule and I think from the beginning the Americans the UN have been you know focused on framework agreements, implementation agreements and they've been largely uninterested to be honest in the real business of politics. So you know handbox government sort of sells its legitimacy down the river and for a moment he is the most popular politician probably in Sudan's history. You know when it when he takes power right but he doesn't use it to build up he doesn't take up that force of the revolution and use it to pressure the army it kind of dissolves and it dissolves also because international money doesn't come quick enough so the US hang its aid on Sudan normalizing times with Israel. Which happens later and like this not popular among the FF so the initial attempt to liberalize the economy is blocked by members of the FFC because they know they're going to lose popular support it only happens later so that they're and all of the actual questions the real questions which are about is the army including the economy running the economy. A block so there's a dismantling committee the dismantling committee is there to destroy what remains of the NCP the old economic empire of Bashir and the army looks at this and he looks at them because no we don't want to do that we want to take it over. Yeah so they want to dismantle the dismantling committee in your article gunshots and cartoon in new left review you have an amazing account of the way the economy was divided between the various forces like the Sudanese army the national intelligence and security service and the RSF the the military runs the construction firms the mining services the banks and the RSF takes over gold mining and as you say lucrative mercenary services. Right because I think fundamentally that the other problem here is that it's it's fundamentally an extractive industry right it's so it's an economy based on what like by our would call extra version so you get the resources from the periphery but you don't rely on political legitimacy from those communities rely on the foreign currency that those resources are bringing in and in the sense the condition of bringing in that foreign currency is the suppression of the communities from which the resources are going to be. It's like imperialism but within a state kind of yes exactly yeah and I think that's like it's not an accident that this is the inheritance of the British of the British probably much worse today and much more Ameratrice but there is that sense that the one of the sort of the weirdnesses I think about this current war which I will get to where it begins is that we have two forces fighting all over the country neither of which have very much popular legitimacy. I wanted to ask you that I've heard I don't really understand the current control maps about Sudan and I'm not sure there is that kind of control but they they do show the RSF controlling Darfur and controlling parts of the South as well. First of all is that accurate and if it's accurate is it because they just have the preponderance of forces or because they have real support. So there's definitely support for the RSF within the Darfur Arab groups but even there it's complicated because hemmity came to power by pushing out Musa Helaal who was the former great Genjuede leader. Musa Helaal has been backed by the army to be a counterweight in Darfur and let's not forget that that that that hematy waged a war against all the Darfur rebel groups for a decade killing thousands of people. So he's not a popular figure in Darfur right in some areas right and it's the so command control is uncertain. There are many different stories I would say that in general the story that I'm hearing in the media is almost exactly wrong. It's almost like the inverted image of what's the actuality on the ground. So the client there's a claim that the Sudan Armed Forces is running cartoon or is about to win back cartoon. The reverse is true like street by street it's the RSF who are making gains they may gain from this alpha cartoon yesterday they just took over the major munitions factory in the northwest of cartoon today and the reason for that partly is that they have experienced fighting in cities from Libya from Yemen for and they're much. I mean it's a smaller force right it's probably half the size. Two thirds of the size of the army and but they have the experience and the and staff don't in fact much of the fighting for staff as far as I understand it in cartoon is being done by what used to be the national security services operations brigade. Okay so these are much closer to the is miss and the cartoon is run by our self and it will continue to be run largely I think by the RSA the planes can't do that much they can bomb the barrow which is being a great cinematic but there's no one in the parks. Yeah it struck me as kind of a bad sign for the army that they're already using the Air Force in cartoon so heavily because I'm one thing you you learn in 21st century wars that you can't just unless you're going to bomb the city out of existence which has been done a few times. You can't just do it with air power you have to go in and clear out the buildings and if you can't do that if you can't make your soldiers do that it's a bad sign when you have your your air forces but I wanted to ask when you were sitting in these cafes or whatever like in normal daily life in the days before this war broke out. Was the RSA for presence was the essay of a presence the RSA was definitely a presence the RSA was invited basically to keep control of cartoon. I mean equal to 2019 by. So it's sort of let you know from the south perspective let the beast into the house and so yeah they were definitely on the street it wasn't like you know we're doing comparison like jubber the capital of South Sudan. After 6pm there are checkpoints throughout the city and the army is a massive and the national security service and so on are a massive presence it wasn't like that in. In Sudan like you know you get tailed I get tailed by national security but there wasn't the sort of like overarching serious military presence except you know in protests in the week running up to the coup and in army checkpoints around the military headquarters but it wasn't the sort of you know if you've been in like the Baghdad when America was there wasn't that militarization of the city that was sort of lying latently because. The RSA had installed themselves in residential areas right where they distinctive I mean did they stand out as Darfurie people or provincials as opposed to the the urbanites you know it's done is a massively multi ethnic. Country and we should say and one of the things that hemmity did was try to broaden the RSF's base if not its command and he did that pretty successfully partly by offering people with options used to fight in Yemen and the money you'd get for fighting in Yemen is three or four times what you'd get working for the RSF in Sudan so that's why just to come back one of your earlier questions there is RSF support and especially among the Missourier which is a group in the south called the farm. And they've and the RSF recently have won a series of battles against SAF including in elevator in court of the fan which is one of the like between North and South court of the family of the largest areas. Insights and so they're not just Darfurie they are of course also Darfurie I think there's you see this racism which unfortunately is married by the international media with everyone going ah look they speak French ah they are from Chad ah they have two nationalities but of course they are. Foreign Chad has always had so much movement between them I mean not just refugees but like groups that shared like populations on both sides of the border and the idea that that makes of our marks them as impure is itself I think a sort of a legacy of a racism of the center yeah and yes like you can yeah you mean you can it's much more easy to work out whose RSF because they were identical uniforms and their motor fighting is different right like the RSF you know like for the most of the time. So I know like forged itself as Janju eat in the fuhrie wars so everyone's mounted on technical so on Toyota's with 12.4 millimeter machine guns in the back and they drive very fast and they shoot a lot of bullets how many in an accurate right so that's it's a very different like logic of war to the way South fight or to the way you know there's no artillery here there isn't like infantry in the same fashion. And so you know the RSF were very good at doing what they were doing right so there's not it's not a they are they do have support in some of the country it is and then it's a patchwork and they don't have much support there's a popular national force he's not a popular politician in that way he it just as much as the army is a sort of legacy of the she is transaction of politics and this military extractive machine. And I think the sort of the weirdness about that is that if this war ends in a way everything will have to start again in terms of the actual like discussion over the shape of the country right now because what you what we did have was that you know since 2019 to fall of the year the entire international community's question has been civilians or military so we're going to see how do they live together now everyone's forgotten about the civilians. It's just military versus military but that's never going to answer the question of how to rules are done. Well in the US and the kind of NGO world probably is also like just have elections and that solves everything right right which which you know maybe it could and it would certainly be nice but like it also could could not if you're not really talking about the deep structural problems there and and also I imagine it the more it gets fractured the more even elections could be really good. The international community really briefly did two I think really problematic things one is that after we had this transitional government after the shea falls there's still a war going on in Sudan between the briefries and the center and penalty and the army take the lead in an negotiation called the Juba agreement to be a peace agreement which brings the rebels into government. And so what was once a civilian transitional government is now full of rebel leaders and it uses those rebel leaders right to split the civilians and prepare the ground for the coup right but for the international's this is great because it means wars finished and they can put a poster you know on their desk at state in foggy bottom saying look we've helped end the war yeah that was the first one and then more importantly. The coups failing September October last year so and the international's don't want the Q to happen anymore they need to spend their donor money and so on and so forth so they push the forces into the framework agreement framework agreement to sign last December and it's an agreement between hematee but Han it recognizes himity and the existence of the RSS which has always been contested and several of the civilian partners and the FFC what this does is introduce a new dynamic. In Sudan is politics where it's no longer the army against the civilians but it becomes both of the two main armed forces of the Han and hematee trying to recruit to them civilian political support rebel support from the peripheries and external support right and so really the frame of agreement sets in motion the war that we now have right like it's a war produced by partly bad international politics maybe it would have happened anyway but like at least like the process of getting from the war. And as part of this international's announced that we would like a government by the end of Ramadan so they have to now resolve security sector reform and security sector reform is often says is the process right it is the question of the future of the militarized economy of the country and this would take a year two years if there was political will from the two parties and instead they have a month. Right but you mentioned one thing that struck me about this and it seems I've called hard to think to say but most urban fighting is very brutal and features a lot of atrocities against civilians but if there's one one thing that's been maybe just bias news coverage but my impression is there haven't been a lot of massacres of civilians by either side so far and often there is if one side decides to say it's not a war. There's a lot of massacres of civilians in X neighborhood belong to the other side they're going to be in great danger but I haven't heard much about that that doesn't mean it didn't happen but has it happened. Not really there's been some attacks on markets for instance especially in Darfur thus far it really is two sort of extraneous military machines fighting over fighting for the fate of a country in which no one really recognizes themselves in either of these things. And if they do it's because opportunistically they need to get a job and one of the ways of your young man to survive and to provide for a family is to become a young foot soldier for one of these forces. That could change right I think like one of the dangers is that there are of course like deep ethnic dimensions to this there's the racism of the center against the periphery. There are the Arab populations in Darfur who look worried and look to him a tea in part right and then at the same time the rebels from Darfur so Minimanawi, Jabril, Ibrahim have joined with Bahan. Having been with him a tea their former foe they've switched roles he's doing something called the Kyro process doesn't really matter what it was and so you have the ground there for really. For sort of the two forces take hold of extant ethnicized fractures in the country and that would be the horrific development that would really lead to a generalized civil war right right that's awful can we talk about the international aspect of it too because you know obviously the first way to understand this and again so helpful that your article is you get you get an understanding of this. This war this new war from the inside from the sort of domestic you know political economic cultural you know background but a lot of the Western press at least is a lot more focused on the international players in this and kind of particularly they want to talk about rush right I mean obviously rushes on this first on the minds of as like villain number one. But they're rolling this seems not as clear cut if you want it I don't know it doesn't seem as clear cut in a way except that they're certainly not a force for democracy and good you know the Wagner group and whatever but everybody seems to have some interest there and they find themselves I don't know on side so it seems that you know Wagner group is with him and tea but the Russian state maybe is with Al-Baron which would be kind of weird that the Russian state would be on. Difference if that's even true from Wagner that the UAE is with him and see that this CC in the Egyptians are with Barani and the army what could you say about when the US again US is like they just their it's Israel is their first priority in this and the second one is sort of let's get a deal done by this date and get an elections that we can sort of sell to the people but anyway what's your impression of the role that they're playing in in the lead up to this I guess and then like going forward with what role they might be playing. I mean I think the first important thing to be saying is that this is not a war as of yet dominated by external parties and if you want to look for its structure in its agency you have to look to the Sydney's actors. Yes so Saudi and the Emirates have played both sides and they've been not particularly reliable backers of either so they they signed off on the coup in October 2021 and promised financial assistance we say then fail to deliver to the coup participants which is part of why the regime was weak. The Emirates have always been pretty close to to hematee and partly because all the gold goes to the hematee but it's only particular princes who have faced hematee were other princes are much closer to and so they have also played the double game in that way hematee's closest ally is Mansur bin Zayed al-Nakhyan the owner as you know of Manchester City. Right I saw that. You know and whereas the moon has gone in with him with with with with but ham so I there's no I don't think there's much of a coherence I think there's a lot of opportunism and there's been reports from the Americans and from others that the after the Emirates have sent money and ammo and material to hematee which I don't know. Which I don't have external sources to confirm but seems entirely believable and the Russians again right are playing a double game but they're also not that active right right and but so we should not only they playing a double game but of course all the parties involved are playing a double game so but harm was caught away in the Russians back in September that but harm was also sending guns to Ukraine. And I interviewed some of the people on those flights. No one's ever put up on the story so I'm just you know interesting so he was at the same time like you know cultivating Putin and sending guns to Ukraine and on the other side of that. I have to say. I think that's really like the interesting aspect of this you know new multi polar world which is there's like this scalar logic of alliances where people can be opposed. You know like people can be opposed in Libya and on the same side in yes in Sudan and vice versa right like it's almost as if there is no the enemy of my enemy is not my friend it's like in different situations I will hate you and I will love you. So I'm just kind of thinking about what's happening right but there's no sort of adherence to this picture yeah there's I mean I think the great fear for barhan is that Ethiopia will take advantage of intervene and there has been contact between hematine Ethiopia but Ethiopia is also massively divided yes. We've had people wondering if the collapse of Sudan if it happens will destroy the whole region or I mean there seems to be an argument between now the collapse of Sudan will destroy the whole region and no the collapse of Ethiopia would destroy the whole region but clearly these two Nile powers are very important and between them south Sudan. So the problem is still too weak and too divided to do much is that correct. This is how some of his government itself is divided because took to got law who's a sort of main security adviser to the president who is Bashir adopted son. Is very close to hematine and several people close to south and present very close to him and they're currently trying to sort of get themselves out of those connections because salver like the president's main alliances with the hunt but there's not going to be a sort of a decisive military intervention from south Sudan or a decisive diplomatic intervention. So that's the mean everyone is sort of looking for for backers that there have been claims that the Wagner group has offered hematine service to MSILE but I don't have external confirmation of that beyond what I read in the press. There's more rumors and the thing else the one thing we can say for certain is that Egypt is the size of the in with the hand and will not accept. And I have been providing fire pilots and have been providing fire jets and that is clear and I have proof of that and why is that why why is he so because he's like season but hand season the military like it's little brother and to be sure the sudden his army was always modeled on Egyptian army right now you look at the gypsies economic empire well that's what's done during the summer it was the previous clonier regime was the angle Egyptian condominium government. Right right it was Egypt as well yeah so there's this long history in which hematy is this you know dangerous militia figure from the provinces and so that's. It's so he's so disliked by the Egyptians that they're willing to go in with but hand though but hand has links to the old regime and the problem between Egypt and Sudan previous to one of the many problems was these limits right. Because of course he's no friend of the one of the brother of course so at the moment they're sort of holding their nose and backing but hand with the idea that he can control the various sort of forces that he's summoning up. And it's so wild every story you know and just complex and it just it doesn't seem like it's going to end anytime soon it doesn't seem like it's something very easy to patch up because even if you patch it up it's going to keep keep falling apart and I guess of one side can. It completely subjugates the other but it seems that both sides are one has has kind of numerical superiority and some period in certain weapons but the other has kind of mobility and training superiority it doesn't seem like it's going to end any. No it's going to be urban fighting and you can easily reach a stalemate in urban fighting just fire across the street at each other for months and months. What are you hearing on the future of this war like in bottling it up. I think for him it's an existential war. This is his one shot no one you know like the elite don't like me is the unpopular kid in high school and here is the capacity to take power. What he tried to do after the frame of a dream was really reach out to the civilians to the FFC and position himself as the person that could take South Sudan into a civilian transition. I'd if you know a ceasefire comes with a return of the basic issue right which is that what led to this war was an SSR a security sector reform discussion that had the RSF being integrated into the army. If they're integrated into the army is controlled of gold is control of his troops goes where there's no future for him there unless he can be given massive amounts of assurances so I think for him and he does really there is no chance of him. Turning back from this yes because I don't think I don't think he ever gets another chance to run so done right right and if the situation becomes one in which he's really losing. Then what you get is you get another war in Dufford which has never actually stopped right in which he becomes one of the forces against the government in Dufford. I think but Han has more possibilities of sort of coming to the table like this like strategically in terms of like he's representing the institution. He's actually to play two things one is we shouldn't underestimate the depth of hatred felt by many in the elite and in the middle ranks of the army against him. Yes, we shouldn't underestimate the hatred of him and see by the old regime because the him and he sold out for sure right and I think another possibility that will come if this war continues is that but Han is deposed from within the army and the behind is replaced by a figure much closer to the old regime right and more brutal in a sense. Yeah, I know this is superficial but when you when you look at these figures in little video clips, baron doesn't seem that strong. He doesn't seem that that tough. He met he does look pretty tough but presumably just because of the nature of the army there are people behind baron either to step into his shoes or to support him if he's doing what they want. I don't I don't know are there people behind him and he or his his base shallow. I mean that's the difference if you killed but Han or deposed but Han then Kabashi or Variety by the generals could take over if he met he dies well the other set of really yeah you know like the second in command his brother oh well yeah well yeah presumably people have thought of that so I hope it travels with the. You know if you want to just to end the conflict today without questions about justice or adequacy or whatever but just like stop the fighting then you would work out where hematism you kill him right yeah because I think that they would be seismic the effect on the arts and it might create a totally unpredictable period of violence yeah because the RSF know that even if there's an amnesty for them that they're going to be in for it but that's the he's not so suitable in the way that but Han is. In the way that but Han is a suitable right right I really appreciate it Josh were coming on and giving us this I mean this is more than an overview this is this gives you a real. Deeper nuanced sense and it's it's you know it's depressing. As as most wars are it is it's pretty depressing but you know to sound cold hearted it makes a wonderful intricate narrative sense it does yeah there's none of this sense. There's none of this senselessness that that is attributed to every place outside DC and London by the mainstream press makes perfect sense yeah terms yeah it's not ideological though but but in every other way it makes. Perfect sense yeah and it's intricate I mean in its own intricate way yeah really appreciate you taking the time that was that was great thanks for joining us that's Joshua craze we're going to post links. To his articles the gunshots in cartoon in the in the new left review and to your your personal web page as well and I think you had a mention of your I think you have a book you're working on right about south Sudan well it's about the relationship of war to bureaucracy to silence it's for the fits throughout auditions in London but it's a literary book that sort of takes you through 10 years of trying to talk sense to the State Department. It's a sort of like what does it mean to be an expert and a war rider today in the 21st century and what relationship was knowledge after politics but mainly it's jokes. Yeah specials so you know that's my main selling. That's great that's something a great. A rich field yes we'll have to have you on when they comes out yeah. All right thanks again Joshua craze and we'll be back after quick break. Okay that was our discussion with Joshua craze about the violence. In so Dan which threatens to potentially turn into something like a civil war even though even though no one seems to really care about taking a particular side at this moment but he does sort of explain how this could transform pretty easily. And also how it could end which I mean I don't know it could it. Hamedi side seems like the weaker side if you were an outside power betting if only because it's so top heavy without him any the whole rsf project seems to die on the other hand it's probably got a better fighting force. Yeah and the essay of so it seems like it's winning on the ground in in cartoon but at the same time yeah. There's a reason that the Confederates always yell general lead to the rear because if he gets shot in the head it's all over a lot sooner and that's what happens if Hamedi does. I didn't ask Joshua in our interview but it does kind of hit me like it seems there is a real possibility let's say if Hamedi's forces really gain the upper hand of a more serious intervention by Egypt and I'll see see. I mean put it this way I wouldn't be totally surprised you know when you do read the history of Sudan and Joshua alluded to this I mean the that condominium the well first the Egyptian Ottoman forces and then I guess the Egyptian British I mean they the Egyptians kind of see Sudan as their backyard and and CC probably more so than even others. And probably will I wouldn't be surprised if they intervene more overtly yeah well there yeah there are all kinds of ways of intervening yes assassination to me yes comes to mind. The Egypt has a lot more money than then Sudan and presumably there's somebody in his entourage who would be interested in making a phone call for twenty million dollars I don't know yeah. Anyways thank you again to Joshua craze for coming on the show and thanks john branding and everyone thanks everybody. you",
