    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. The day today is December 5th, 2022. And this is episode 357. I'm the ghost, Mark Ames. I'm up here in Western New York Rochester, Lake Ontario, the whole Shabang. Adam and the line with John Dolan, aka Gary Bredchietio, aka The Warner in Trees, John, how you doing? Pretty good. I just thought I'd mention one thing about Italy at the moment because it has some relevance to the Ukraine War. The heat went on at the end of November. It had been officially off till then in order to save energy. And now it's officially on, but the hours you can use it are strictly limited and the temperature is limited to 20 degrees, which I guess is about 68 Fahrenheit. This is all officially related to the natural gas problem and the war. Interesting. So it's central heating in the building like everybody. Yeah. Is it steam radiator, like Moscow? Radiator, yeah. Yeah, interesting. Okay. Huh. So 68, if I remember right, and one of these days we'll get to this, but John, I was young, but I still have some burned in memories of that period. 73 or 74 when we had the energy crisis, the first one, and Nixon was in office and everybody was supposed to set their heaters no higher than 68 and their ACs no lower than I think it was 72 or something. I can't remember 74. Do you remember that at all or no? I remember that, but I think it was the AC temperature was a little higher than that, like 74, which seemed like an outrage. Yeah. We will die. Yeah. Yeah. The heat part, I guess, wasn't as big a deal, but that part, yeah. At least for us Californians. Wow. So, yeah, the war, the war kind of hits home. Is there been any grumbling? Not that I know. I don't think so. I mean, it's not like the heat police are going to kick in your door. You know, it's the, in fact, there's a very Italian qualifier on the notice, like, you are absolutely limited to 20 degrees with a tolerance of one to two degrees. Good for them. That's great. Yeah. I mean, one thing I've noticed too, and then we'll get to our guest here, is that Maloney, the sort of what post fascist leader, the FDA leader, who's now prime minister heard her numbers have ticked up only since she took power. And I just saw a poll out of Germany and the green party, which is already, their numbers already went up a lot, like they've been soaring. The more hawkish pro-war they are, the more they say we need nuclear power and coal and everything, like basically the more they are the opposite of what they were supposed to be, the higher their poll numbers go, like they're passing up everybody. It's insane. Yeah. The German green party is very hard to understand from a distance right now. I just remember that famous tweet by one of their leaders saying, I don't care what my constituency thinks this is an overwhelming military necessity and we're going to do what's right for the war effort. Not very green. No, it's really weird. All right. So let us get to our guest, an old friend of the show, and just general friend, as Jim and he click might say. Yasha Levine joining us, a long time colleague, Yasha has his own sub-stack, just yasha.substack.com. He is the author of Surveillance Valley, which when it first came out, well, we've had him on the show about this, but when it first came out, people, a lot of people, particularly in the sort of Intel cyber or whatever world, reacted like, I don't know, I mean, like squeal basically that you can't do this by saying that, you know, the tech is not this free Jeffersonian utopian paradise and the whole thing is up to its eyeballs and military intelligence and oligarchy. Anyway, now I think a lot of that's become common knowledge. He also has a podcast through his sub-stack called The Russians with his wife, you begin, yeah? Anyway, first of all, Yasha, welcome back to the show. Thanks. Thanks for having me on. It's been a while. Yeah, I know it's, it has been a while. In fact, every time I was going to try and get you on, Yasha, you seem to be doing something else. Like the last time we were going to try and get you on, you actually were heading to Russia with your wife and your baby. Yeah, the smartest trip, you know, undertaken in the history of the world, you know, it was just easy vacationing. Yasha's national lampoon potent adventure, potent vacation. Yeah. I don't know, can you briefly tell us what happened with that? You've got any hadn't been back to Russia in a bunch of years and she was kind of feeling a bit nostalgic for her homeland, you know, and at the same time, we kind of had been kind of low-key trying to develop this Soviet zombie horror film that we co-wrote. And before this whole war broke out, we were actually, if Gennie was actually planning to go back to Russia and start setting up the process of shooting this very, very low budget kind of indie horror film. And the war kind of obviously just exploded those plans completely. And so when there was a law in the fighting and it seemed like, you know, things were just going to be normalized and kind of stay like this for a long, long time, you know, just a kind of slow advances in retreats in the battle front, you know, and total normalization of the war in Russian society and kind of just people not even really paying attention to it anymore. You know, without we just sort of pop in to see how things were. And it's a pop in. You guys went up and take one year old daughter with us. And to see if it was, you know, it would be possible to shoot something there even at a time of war, you know. We probably knew the answer to it in the back of our minds, but we were kind of a denial about it, you know. And so we went, yeah, we went there and we're going to spend, obviously getting in is very difficult, you know, you have to, you can't fly directly from Europe there, you have to kind of go around or you have to go by one of the lamb orders. So you can either, you know, get in Russia from Europe by land, by a bus, basically or fly into Turkey or Dubai, or, you know, some central, some central Asian Republic or Armenia or Georgia. So it's like you have to make these big roundabout trips there. So we decided to go kind of the more direct way into Russia through Finland, partially because we have friends who live in Finland and we're going to stay with them for a couple days and kind of reactimate before we, you know, make the next move on to the next part of our trip and try to get into Russia. While we were obviously in Finland, we got really sick. All three of us, not with COVID, but some kind of pretty nasty, I don't know what it was, we don't know what it was, but it was pretty nasty. So it floored us right away. And so we were coming into Russia, we were already just sort of, I don't know, deadly sick because we have sleep deprived and kind of on the road. And so we caught this, my, my, my, again, you basically got almost pneumonia and when we arrived in Leningrad, so we were like better at basically, like a week and a half when we arrived there. And as soon as we, as soon as we kind of started feeling better and started moving around and interacting with people, you know, putting order to mobilization. Right. And that's what we like. We're going to order everything we just shed in every part of the area and everything all is completely crazy. And so we were, we, we also were about, we were going to leave it roughly around that time, planning leave. But we didn't have any, we didn't have a plan. We didn't have any tickets out of the country, you know, we thought we were just going to sort of play it by ear when we got there and we weren't sure when we were going to leave. And so we, like everyone else, was scrambling to find a way out of the, way out of Russia during the mobilization order, right after the mobilization order. Right. So ultimately we decided to leave also by land through, through the Estonian border. And somewhere between Estonia and somewhere, somewhere between like leaving the country and getting to Estonia and then going further into back to Finland, we caught COVID. And so on the, on the, on the, on the tail end of our trip out of Russia, we got even, you know, sick even more. So we were sick for most of the time that we were, you know, on the road there. It was pretty brutal. Sounds like Napoleon's invasion. Yeah. Yeah. And get sick, retreat. You know, it's been quite a bit of time in Russia. And so it was interesting to be there, you know, because we were there for the normalization of it and then for the sort of, and then when things kind of got escalated, you know, seriously escalated in Russian society when the general mobilization was announced by Putin. And, yeah, it was, it's a really strange place right now. I got to say, like, you know, very schizophrenic, right? Because on the surface, everything there is normal. Like it's really normal things. Okay, things are things, some things are a lot more expensive. You know, the people who have no money are, you know, are fucked even more than they usually are. But it's just a matter of like degree, I guess. It's not like it's not like something, you know, it's not like the siege of Lenin grad. Yeah, just, it's a, there's people are just poor, you know, poor people are already poor and the people who have a bit of money, you know, don't pretty much don't feel it at all, you know, who have money don't feel it at all because they're just paying a little bit extra for things, you know, which they don't seem to mind. I mean, the only thing that's really difficult is travel, right? So it's harder to travel the year. But even, even we spent most of our time in Lenin grad because we just, we got, we got sick and just stuck there and decided to just, you know, stay put for a while. But even there are people, you know, just, we'll take the bus, we'll take the bus out to Finland or take a car out to Finland and then fly out from Finland to wherever they wanted to go. You know, people who already had visas to EU visas or people who have like residency permits or, you know, or who have second citizenship because we know what people don't realize. And in the West, I think when they do these sort of travel bands is that the most elite people in Russian society aren't really touched by them because they have dual citizenship. They either have, you know, EU citizenship through like some, through basically investing in like Cyprus or something, you know, Cyprus, yeah. Or they have Israeli citizenship or they have some other, or they have American citizenship or they have some kind of other arrangement, right, that allows them to move around pretty freely despite these bands. And so the only people who really affected by it are like middle class people, I guess, you know, or like upper middle class people who don't have that. But even they still have, you know, open visas that are still valid for a while. And so people are even like moving around and going to Europe is just a bit more uncomfortable. So just there's a very strange feeling there. You know, there's a war happening and, you know, people have different sort of opinions on the war. I don't know, but like it, it just seemed like, and everybody really wanted to acknowledge that, you know, like people weren't denial about it basically and didn't want it to intrude on their lives. Right. So what was interesting about the mobilization order was that like it put and kind of made it like, that was the sort of unwritten sort of agreement, right, or it's spoken agreement, which is that we're going to wage this war, but you're going to live your life like you always had. It's not going to touch you. Yeah. And we're going to get these contractors. We're going to get these people for the promises. We're going to pay some money. They're going to be the ones, you know, dying and fighting in the trenches there, right? And it's not going to touch the majority of the population, especially people in the big cities, especially the professional class and especially sort of the urban class, right? And with the mobilization order that that unspoken agreement, it seemed to have been sort of torn up, right? And because suddenly people who weren't really worried about the war and who maybe were against the war, but weren't worried about touching them personally on this kind of level were like looking for ways to get the hell out of the country. Or if they couldn't get out of the country because they had family, you know, and they had kids and wives and and a job then they just couldn't leave. And if they wanted to, we're like, you know, paranoid and not going into certain, not going to certain portions of, let's say, the kind of the country side around St. Petersburg towards Finland because they knew that cars going that direction were being stopped and some people were getting their mobilization draft orders right there, you know, right there. They were actually pulling people out of cars. Wow. I heard a lot of crazy stories too from some people. They were in those days after the mobilization order. Yeah. I was, because we had, we were actually taking the train from St. Petersburg to Moscow, right as Putin made the announcement. And you could tell like the kind of the, I don't know, like the vibes in that train car because it's all kind of professional people, you know, people with a bit of money because it's an expensive, it's an expensive ticket to get from because it's like the, the speed train, you know, the kind of the bullet train. And so the vibes there got like a lot more cold, you know, people just stopped talking and kind of, but to your question, yeah, when we got to Moscow and I started talking to people back at St. Petersburg, you know, that I was, touch with their saying, yeah, we're not even going to go like pick mushrooms in the direction of Finland because our friends are telling us, you know, that they know people who are, you know, going that direction towards, you know, in the direction of the Finnish border and they were being pulled over and they were getting papers handed to them right there on the side of the road. That kind of stuff. Wow. Yeah, that's, that's pretty scary. We, I won't get into any details now just to be safe, but we are hosting right now a refugee, a war riff, a mobilization refugee, somebody, my wife knew in Moscow who got served papers and did not want to go kill Ukrainians and die and get shot and all that stuff and got the hell out and went and went through a securitus with the one sort of positive thing I could say is that it does seem, you know, contra Michael McFall and all these Atlanta council and people, especially people from Eastern Europe and Baltics from all the think tanks and political world have been pushing hard that every country should deny Russians that they want to blockade Russians in to force them to write in their minds, which wouldn't happen to rise up against Putin or they just, they just don't want Russians around. I don't know. I think it's a very pure spike, man. It's pure spike in my opinion. Yeah, it is because they know they're not going to rise up. They just don't want them even seen as people really, you know, because if you accept them as refugees, it means you admit that there are some quote, unquote good Russians along with quote, bad Russians. But this guy here, you know, he crossed the border through Mexico and they were pretty, they were pretty understanding and pretty good about it. And you know, there's other indications we have from other people. We know that there's been a sort of understanding. I mean, there was a New York Times article about the problems Russians have had, but I think it's really changed in the last couple since the mobilization order to try to help them get out because it's obvious. I mean, if you're serious about this, you don't want them going and killing Ukrainians and dying for that matter. And you also get smart people coming here, you know. So I think, yeah, I think with it, anything on the border, you know, it's, I think it's also can be just it's random, right? I mean, some people have decent experiences, decent experience. It can't be. Yeah. We'll coast through the process and other people get stuck in there and get the full like border experience that America usually offers to, you know, migrants who try to cross it. Yes, get a silence. This brutal, I know, which is like you get stuck in the, you get stuck in this privatized prison system. Exactly. That was that that New York Times article was about and these Russians got put in the geo prison systems in Louisiana. I mean, it's a, as this one guy said, it's like going from Russia to Russia. It's just gnarly. But but there, we know a translator who said that they're, they're like clear directives interesting. Interesting. Interesting. Speaking of, you know, speaking of the border, because you know, it was interesting to go because we were, we left a, I guess I can't remember now because I was just so, so sleep deprived and, and you know, one thing that goes out, it goes immediately out the window when you don't sleep is you can't really form memories. But like, you know, so we left about a week, maybe just a little bit less than we maybe five days after the mobilization order. And so we were on the bus through Estonia and and and we, so like so when we see it across the Russian border first and then the Russian border and then the Estonian border. Exactly. And on both of those borders, we weren't sure if we were going to be let through actually. Despite the fact that we have both American citizenship, you know, all three of us have American citizenship. Because, you know, on sort of the EU side, right? So some of these Baltic states were kind of being basically out of pure spite were once in a while or, or you know, it was not clear how often it was happening, but it was happening enough to get like an official response from Israel and from I think America, most likely, was that they were not letting in dual citizenship, dual citizens of America of Israel and Russia through the border and into EU into the EU. Right. And so, and so I remember even like before we left, I even called up there, American embassy in Estonia and asked them like, so if like your dual Russian American citizen, well, like is what do you know about the situation in the border? Is Estonia letting people like that through? And the guy said that well, they should let you through, but it's basically up to the border guard, you know, and they can deny you. Because you don't really have any rights in the border, right? Yeah. They only, they only people. So anyway, so we were passing through, we weren't sure what was going to be happening on the Russian border because there were, you know, there were some, we were getting some information that Russia was detaining people who have American citizenship for the questioning. And in fact, it was, it was, we were right because when the bus arrived on the Russian checkpoint, Ivanka, on sort of the, on the Russian side, yeah. And you know, what they did is they like the person, the border patrol person came in and said, all the Ukrainian citizens and all American citizens step out of the bus, please. And so we got, and so it's so, and which is like, basically, they were being out of, also out of spite, you know, because Russians were being treated poorly by the EU and by kind of the, well, and by America, apparently, apparently Russians are getting kind of tourists are getting flagged for secondary inspection and interrogation at the borders, we heard, um, they're doing the same thing to Americans just to make life kind of uncomfortable for them. And so, and so our bus driver even said, well, if you're an American, you have an American citizenship, you're probably going to miss the bus. They're probably not, they're probably going to keep you at the, at the border station for a couple hours. And so we're going to have to like go on, you know, without you. And so you're going to have to wait for the next bus. And so ultimately that didn't, and then ended up not happening in part because we have a small child with us. And so I think they felt like a little bit more, you know, I don't know, predisposed towards us. And she's pretty, she's pretty charismatic. But, you know, the Ukrainians were held back in the Ukrainian citizens who, you know, a lot of Ukrainians leave, basically had had to kind of go east, right? If they were wanted to flee the war zone and evacuate, they couldn't go west. They went east and so they went through, sort of eastern Ukraine and through Rustov and, you know, and so a lot of the Ukrainians ultimately make their way up north. Right. And kind of go to the EU through the Finnish border or the Estonian border or the Latvian border. Right. And so there were a lot of Ukrainians there on the border point. And they were being held back by the Russian border guards and just held there for hours. And each one was being called up and questioned, you know, interrogated at the border. And so there was kind of a lot of misery at that border point. Um, well, weren't they stopping? I mean, I would have thought they'd stop, as they say, men of military age with Russian citizenship like to prevent them from getting out of the country. They weren't doing that though. But I craved that. They were some of that happening. Yeah. Yeah. There was some of that happening, but not there was some of that happening, but so there was like a, it was basically like a lottery. You know, you could be stopped or you could, right, and turn back for whatever reason, or you could be let through. And I think most of them letting people through. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And because there were a bunch of younger, younger Russian guys, you know, a lot of them had dual citizenship. Some of them actually lived in the West. Some of them, you know, just had dual citizenship, but they lived, you know, like in Israeli or American citizenship, but they lived in Russia and they were getting out. And so the atmosphere on that bus, when we left the station in St. Petersburg and drove towards the border, you know, nobody was talking to each other. It was pretty great. People were nervous because they weren't sure. A lot of people weren't sure if they're going to be let out, right? And the bus was completely packed, obviously. And so when we cleared the check, the Russian, you know, border and headed over the bridge to the Estonian side, everybody just started, you know, being friendly, talking, you know, everyone's telling, you know, telling each other their life stories. So it was like, people were scared, you know, it was, it was a pretty grim atmosphere. I got to say the Russian state, when it comes a lot, like I experienced this a few times, and this would be true probably of a lot of states, but I couldn't be care of the Russian state. Like as a rule, when I was living there, the Russian state was sort of, you know, barely there, you know, except once in a while, they'll extract bribes from you, but you didn't feel like the full blanket force of the state hardly after, after 91. But once in a while, it would rear its ugly head like in 99 after, when the apartment bombings happened and then put into cover, it was, it was just a completely different vibe. And you realized, well, this state may seem to not touch you, but actually like, when people are activated and they know that they have to act and do shit, like it, it was frightening. I mean, it was kind of frightening. And it was nothing like what you went through though, because what happened when the state was activated this time. And as you said, this didn't really happen in February when they launched the war. It was sort of like the war is going to be over there and everything's going to be fine. But then the war came home and, you know, people were mocking the mobilization and it drove out hundreds of thousands of males. But it did over fulfill its quota also. It did mobilize hundreds of thousands of Russians from everything I understand, including from people who are very, you know, anti-cremeland, like because when the state does activate and they know that they have it, they could get in trouble. Everybody always over activated. I mean, they were all over eager. I mean, that was what happened to happen. Yes. They got to get dressed down actually this is because the military. They came down, yeah. Recruitment, yeah, recruiters had to be dressed down because they didn't, the crumbling like that's the last thing they needed was, you know, to spook the urban population, the support for the war is already tenuous, I think, in a lot of parts of the sort of the urban class, you know, it's not like, like, that's the one thing that I was surprised about, you know, like, or that actually was kind of indicative of the general support for this war. I mean, I would be grudgingly supported or like, kind of, neutrally supported, but there isn't a lot of active support. I mean, I only saw one, you know, like, for instance, one, the Crimea was annexed, right? And I was actually in Russia not long after that. And, you know, people had their, you know, there are people actively sort of supported. You could see it in the streets and like the things that they posted on their cars, you know, they had the, they were flying that kind of the same driven of, just saying George, you know, the kind of the brown and the orange and black one. Cars actively had it, like many, many cars, you didn't have to look for it, you know, just all around you. Clearly people were supported it. And it was genuine. It wasn't like just forced, but it, and not in Moscow and not in St. Petersburg. I didn't really see any Z signs anywhere. I mean, I saw one truck with a Z sign in, like, in the month that I was there in St. Petersburg. And I, and then I saw another Z sign, but these were like basically cadets because there was a military, there was a military academy in St. Petersburg, several of them. And you know, they were kind of running around a park and they had their little like, they were wearing their army, you know, sort of sports uniform, right? Like sweatpants and t-shirts and they all had the t-shirts all had like tiny little Z signs on the back between the shoulder blades, like almost like a Nike swish. Like, like, you know, you know, you see Z signs in Trieste. Don't ask me. It's funny. It's funny. But they're all over the walls. Wow. Yeah. I wonder who they are. No, it's funny. I mean, that didn't exist there at all. There isn't any graffiti. So it's not, I mean, I can understand the Z thing and maybe in the EU and it'll be because it's like an opposition almost thing. It's like, you know, I support like the opposite thing that I can stand for. But there isn't like a lot of grassroots enthusiasm for the war, right? I mean, again, so there, I think you got to divide this stuff. It's like people support it, you know, again, because they do kind of believe that the West is waging this war against them. And you know, and there's like a truth to this, to this, to this, you know, belief, right? But like, but there isn't like an active support of it, you know, like it's not, people aren't like excited about it. It's not, it doesn't even seem like it's not like everyone's flying Russian flags. It's not like a post Iraq, you know, a post 9-11 moment, right? It's not like, yeah, I was surprised. That was, you know, again, you read the things that you read about in the news and then when you actually go to a place, you know, they can be drastically different. And I was surprised by just how little active support and I was talking to my friends who live in St. Petersburg and they said, yeah, like they'll drive around town for days without seeing a Z symbol, you know, and this is before the mobilization war. So I don't think there's that much support. I mean, active enthusiastic support is what I mean, you know, for the war. And so when the mobilization happened, never really sold the war. No, no, no, no, no, it's like, and no one's, no one wants to die, you know, like I was asking people, they're like, are you willing to lose like, you're like, I don't know, like your legs for a Zeparorskaya Oblast, you know, it's like, it's just, it's like, because it's not part of Russia, right? It's the first Oblast and not part of Russia. Are you willing to die defending it or like, you know, taking it back or whatever? And, you know, people just laugh at it at that statement because people in Ukraine, I was talking to a Ukrainian guy, you know, who lives in the States now. And he's like, Ukrainians don't care about Zeparorskaya Oblast. I mean, you know, so it's like the whole thing is just a joke. Of course, and it wasn't sold as like some kind of, there wasn't like a false flag attack or whatever that they staged to, you know, they just said that an attack was in. I mean, the whole thing is a joke. And so there's not a lot of support. So when they, so when, when, when, when they really started grabbing people off the streets and grabbing people out of their, out of, you know, as they were like coming home and, and entering their apartment buildings, you know, that's spooked a lot of people and they just drove everybody out of the, you know, everybody who could go basically left. And I still have people that I know that are in Armenia just hiding out and, you know, figuring out what they're, what the hell they're going to do. It's scary to figure out what the hell you're going to do. No, it's like first you go through the kind of, you have an immediate goal which is getting out, getting somewhere. And so you don't have to think a much about the whole long future ahead of that. And then when you get there, then it's like, shit, what do I do now? No, it's, you know, it's, it's, it's frightening. I mean, no, it for young people, it's a little bit, if you're young and you're just starting out your life, if you're like, I don't know, early 20s or something, it's, it's, it's, so that's, it's probably a lot easier to deal with it and it is a lot easier to deal with it. And you know, when you're established and you have a family and you have a job and you have a business and, and, I mean, you know, there's, it's, you know, going in, you know, it's very difficult. Only if you have like money that is, can like cross borders, basically, right? Like if you're, if you're, if you're of a certain level of wealth, then you can kind of move over your alone, but it's very difficult to do this with families, you know? Obviously. I mean, it doesn't help putting that the war's not going well. I mean, it's going well in the mind of a few, I don't know, of a few of his sort of fans or I don't know, people have some delusions here, but like, it's not, you know, it's not going well, okay? From, from the point of view of the Kremlin. No, it's, it's, it's, and that doesn't help in terms of selling the war like 10 months in, it's not going well, you know, and you could blame the West, but still, I'm just surprised that they didn't stage some fucking, you know, like, I know this one of the things, yeah, people say it like, you know, what choice to put in half? We could have not done this, could have not done a massive invasion. Oh, he was supposed to wait for an invasion. Yes. Actually, if Ukraine was really that stupid that they were going to like stage an invasion, that's absolutely what you do. And you can have the whole country behind him in a second. Exactly. Plus you'd be prepared for it because you supposedly know for sure this is happening. Let him do it. Obviously, because morale is a big thing in war, you know? Yeah. And then this thing was handled, you know, it makes me think that maybe there was a apartment bombings didn't, you know, weren't pulled out by the, that's true because they they were aimed at a mass audience and they really worked on a mass audience. This, from what you guys are saying, it sounds more like Putin and his click are thinking purely in terms of great power elites. Like we, it's us versus the NATO elites and we deploy our cannon fodder and they deploy theirs, but it doesn't work that way. You really need the soldiers, the ones who are about to get killed to care about what they're doing. Yeah. I mean, if, you know, if the apartment bombings were an inside job conspiracy and I think there's a lot of good evidence that there is and again, there are very respectable people who think that's a wacky, you know, a stupid conspiracy theory, including people like Andres O'Dottav one of the most kind of well-known anti-Cremlin dissident journalists today thinks as well. He does. I thought he, I thought that he, I thought that. Unless he changes mine and his book, he said it's a, it's a interesting, interesting conspiracy. Yeah. But, but you know, one thing to remember is that the idea that Putin did that is a, is a bit of a stretch. I mean, Putin had just moved to becoming prime minister and yeah, he was powerful, but like Perazowski had a lot of power at that time, a lot more power. The Chechens were like a real force and they were involved, you know, Bessiav and his people were, they had their own internal fights and were willing to work with other people to change the situation and the FSB was very factionalized and, you know, the Yeltsin family really ruled the country at that time. So, so whoever's doing this shit now is very, very different people except for Putin. For the most part, they're very different people than whoever organized, you know, the apartment bombings. So, maybe there's just lower quality people now. Lower quality people. Yeah, they were, they were, they were more creative, you know, they were, they were cutting edge. Yeah, the guys that are running the show now, they seem to be a little bit, they lost, they're lost their touch maybe, get older and getting a little more of, lazy, yeah. So anyway, we should move on to our other topic. I mean, it's good. We should, I wonder, talk with you about Russia as well. I mean, also just before we started recording, usually something happens. I think the thing that happened today, which may or may not be interesting and relevant, is that it looks like Ukraine fired either a missile or a new drone or something that I think hit an airfield in Engels, Russia and the Sarativsky Oblast, which is pretty deep inside Russia. In fact, Engels is where Lamonov was, was imprisoned after he was found guilty of trying to start some rebellion or something, right? So Lamonov spent his prison time in Engels. And so it looks like Ukraine has pulled off like a deep inside Russia proper, not Crimea, not like on the board of Bilgerud or something, but deep inside Russia proper bombing. And people are kind of nervous, but there's a fatigue here on that too. It's sort of like, well, they haven't, you know, they've been barking every time they say something big is going to happen, but what are the consequences going to be? But it hasn't Belgrade Oblast been basically bomb, you know, it's being being, it's being on the board of the war, yeah. Yeah, but that's on the board of it. This is, you know, Engels is pretty deep inside Russia. Right. Next to Saratol. Exactly. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Saratol. Yeah. It's, it's interesting also that the US said it has adapted the high Mars system that it was giving to Ukraine so that it can't be fired deep into Russia. So they're clearly giving these things to some hotheads in the Ukrainian military and they're nervous about that. Yeah. I don't even know these assholes, man, but basically they're saying that ain't us. We rigged these things so they can't use it. Yeah. Yesterday, Ukraine came out and said somebody from one of the ministries came out and said they just invented a new drone that can go like, I don't know, 700 kilometers, some huge distance that could basically reach, I mean, basically they were announcing an alibi for why they were going to be hitting Engels that it was something completely domestically produced. Interesting. I mean, I think that, you know, that maybe the Americans were a little nervous about it, but, but, you know, the Americans aren't punishing for it. So I guess I'm just kind of waiting to see. Yeah. I mean, what is it? It was Russia going to open up a second front, you know, against NATO. I know. What are the, what are the options, man? Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's, that's for me one of the most amazing and enduring lessons or non-lessons of the war that after the manifest failure of the Russian armed forces in this much smaller war, there hasn't been any renewed talk about a peace debit and since the Russian army has proven to be such an absolute paper tiger. Yeah. Yeah. Well, they've kind of moved that discussion to China. Yeah. Russia, yeah, that's bad, but China, oh, man, that's the big one we have to worry about now, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, all right. So, what we wanted also really to talk about today with you, Yasha, is the latest in the whole Twitter scandal. I mean, obviously over the weekend, or just before the weekend, I guess it was on Friday, our former exile colleague, Matt Taby, published this thread in which he was, I mean, he called it a leak, but it was basically worked with Elon Musk as far as I can tell. I guess we still don't have the details of their arrangement, except that it's pretty clear the arrangement was, you have to publish these leaks or whatever you call them, this dump on Twitter, which raised a whole bunch of other questions. But this has been like both the talk and the outrage and everything of the media world and political world to an extent of the last few days. And since Twitter, since you wrote the book on kind of like blowing open all this romantic BS that people had about Silicon Valley, which thankfully most people have come around to by now, we wanted to get you on the show to talk about Twitter about what the revelations were, how explosive they were or not. You know, we could talk about what Matt did was a big story or not, or whether he did the right thing or not as well. But I don't know where you want to start with this. Well, I mean, I guess I just start with it. I guess with the conversation that we had sort of off of air a few days ago when I guess the kind of started this whole thing is that like, I mean, I guess someone wrote the book on basically the kind of the first book to look at how the internet fits into the American Empire and the military industrial system and sort of just part of the American global system of hegemonic system, right? And how it's used to project American power abroad. And also, you know, and project American power internally as well domestically. You know, I should be more excited about these leaks. You know, it's like, I should be, and maybe if this was like 2014, maybe 2015, at the latest, I probably would have been more excited about them. But when, you know, when things were a bit more, when we were all a bit more naive about these platforms and, you know, still maybe thought that like, I don't know, there's some kind of, I don't know, they could be used for democracy or something or they were at least were neutral in the way that they were run and the way that they managed information and the way that they were administered, that they weren't totally corrupted by, you know, the political system and sort of, I don't know, are all a garkey. You know, I would have been excited about it. But, you know, but at this point, you know, the stuff that was revealed in that first thread by Matt, you know, it's like, okay, there was some rich political people who had a direct line to people in Twitter and could complain to them about certain stories or certain, certain not stories, but just certain tweets, even, you know. Like that doesn't have to be surprising, you know, in 2022, like, I mean, you know, we watched as, you know, for the past six years, probably, since ever since, you know, the Trump years and the election that put Trump in power, you know, we've seen how these platforms who have been, you know, have been just sort of integrated into American political, into America's political system very tightly and integrated. To the point where, you know, I mean, I remember, I can't even remember now the year, maybe, but the 2017 maybe something like that were really like, there were these congressional investigations that were, Democrats were openly threatening, like Facebook and Twitter and telling them essentially directing them to, you know, rein in the bad actors, you know, basically people who are kind of against Democrats and, you know, or like, you know, spreading disinformation, or they'd, or they'd, you know, roll out some antitrust legislation to kind of to, to, to rein these companies in. They were, they were holding this sort of threat of antitrust, which was an empty threat, obviously, as it turned out. But, you know, but there was just, it was just, we've seen, we've seen this stuff, we've seen this happen in real time, or the past six years, how these platforms have been used to censor certain political, certain stories, certain political things. And so it's not so surprising. And the stuff that he's released so far, it's not very interesting. I mean, it's probably, it's, it's interesting from, you know, for journalists or for historians, any kind of information, any kind of restricted information like that, privileged information when it comes to light is, is interesting because it's, you can add, you can use it in your arguments and you can use it to construct some, understand what goes on behind the scenes, I guess, you know, but from like a, from a political perspective, from like a scoop perspective, I don't really see what the big deal is to be honest. And, and, and, yeah, and I have a really, if there's one thing, you tell me what you think, and John, you say, but I would say the, the one kind of most, the most sort of, I don't know, interesting confirmation is that there was no basis, but I mean, not saying nobody already knew this and whatever, but that, that we really were lied to by these intel chiefs about the hunter, hunter, hunter, tombs, hunter Biden, laptop story being a Russian disinformation. I mean, we knew it at the time. Yeah. I mean, those of us who knew it anyways seem pretty obvious that this was not a Russian operation, but, you know, the Democrats have been getting away with calling everything a Russian operation. But, so that seems to be confirmed that there was no basis, but at the other hand, as far as I could tell from what Matt found out, it wasn't like somebody from the government, at least not from here, there wasn't somebody from the government saying you must remove it was more like, you know, it was more like these guys were liberals, because they're in San Francisco, you know, surprise, surprise, and, and they, people were, you know, that crowd was very freaked out by Trump and wondered about. And so they're, they're just their natural bias kind of went to work there. But there wasn't the sort of conspiracy that I think people were looking for. The other thing kind of stood out for me is just that like when, when Matt first did is, as he did this threading really slowly and people got, it was pretty funny actually, because it's not how you're supposed to do it. It's supposed to have it all already worked out in advance, right? And, and like thread. Yeah, they're like, if you're like, they're like, actually, there's like software or services you can use to like, just break up a piece of text into different tweets or something, you know, like, that's what, like, that's what the, that's what the pro, you know, long thread people do, you know, like, because it's just people do those threads and they're just like, they should just hang those people to just hang there. Yeah, but it's right a fucking article. Yeah. Yeah, the spool, but anyway, I, when I saw the first one, I was like, it brought back Russia memories, because, you know, Matt, of course, and then it was like, okay, he's, this is like when the oligarchy under Yeltsin, you know, with the Clinton threat, Department of Treasury created this oligarchy in order to keep our people in power, Yeltsin and so on. It was this whole dirty deal. And part of that was the oligarchs then in 96, 97, 95, 96, 97, really 96, 97, buying up all these great media outlets that had been pretty wild and had great journalism and destroying them pretty much. And then turning them all, I mean, as Vestia and Savoy, you know, I mean, all these outlets that were really good and turning them into weaponizing them so that they did some journalism. In fact, the journalism they did was really only kind of part of the marketing so that when they planted their own compromise to go to, you know, exercise their power over society or over politics, like it would give that compromise more weight because they did other decent journalism. And they just did these, you know, dumps. I mean, all the oligarchs had their own private intelligence forces and people bought off in the FSB and the police. They'd spy, they'd bug rivals in politics or oligarchs. And then they'd leak it through their newspapers, you know, or sometimes their TV outlets. And I thought that and usually this stuff was really sensational, like about stealing, you know, I don't know, you know, barizovsky's like the conversations where he talked about how he stole literally every single dollar from Aeroflot and like wired it all to, you know, Switzerland. Or you know, but it'd be funny. Yeah, if like, yeah, it's true. I mean, I guess if like there's a few took over some kind of company and then like then use got the got, you know, the information from that company and then leaked it, you know, to kind of to fuck over his enemy somehow, you know, that's kind of what's going on here, right? Yeah, I mean, it was not, it just turned out to be, it was just like you did the dirty deal with the oligarch because Musk so badly, and we could go through a time as, but Musk so badly needed something positive about Twitter. I mean, he was like crashing it into the ground at like, you know, maximum accelerated speed and he needed something to change the conversation about Twitter and he did. It worked. Matt changed the conversation. A big story that everyone's talking about as Matt as everyone is it Matt was broken on Twitter. So now people are talking about Twitter differently. It was a pretty dirty deal. And yet it wasn't like there was some great revelation here. I mean, I think as somebody said, like what the right really wanted, I mean, they're kind of like, well, it shows, you know, that the globalists and the wokists, you know, are suppressing the speech, but what they really wanted was like, okay, I've got the children in the pizza parlor, you know, John Podesta's coming over now. Let's go school. That's what they wanted. That's like the equivalent of a Russian oligarch, you know, revelation would have been. I mean, Matt is a good journalist. He knows the craft, right? So, and you know, with journalism, you kind of lead with the biggest thing you have. Yes. With the biggest, most explosive thing you have. And if it's like, okay, maybe there's going to be some other stuff in these leaks because I don't even know how this is going to be structured. Apparently now Barry Weiss is on the deal about like, you just see about this like, yeah, Barry Weiss is now in there working with Matt to like dig through the Twitter emails, but like, I don't even know what the format of this of this dump is, you know, is like, is Ella Musk basically giving them access to, you know, the entire collection of sort of corporate, you know, management level email is, you know, is he doing that? Is it unrestricted? Yeah, some of Matt's own tweets in this, I think 36 tweet series had almost an embarrassed sound to them. Like he's number 10, both parties had access to these tools. That is, you know, to influence Twitter. For instance, in 2020 requests from both the Trump White House and the Biden campaign were received and honored. However, next tweet 11, the system wasn't balanced. It was based on contacts because Twitter was an system not balance. We need to optimize the censorship regime. Yes. Yeah, SF based media company has more DNC types than Trump types. Yeah, that's the scoop. The system wasn't balanced. It was based on contacts because Twitter wasn't his overwhelmingly staffed by people of one political orientation. There were more channels, more ways to complain, open to the left, parentheses, well, Democrats. Because, you know, the audience that he's trying to reach now, he thinks that everything to the left of Hydrick is the left. But Matt has a little too much experience to really believe that. He throws it out there for him, though. He throws it out for him. It's like to normal people, he puts it in parentheses and to his new audience, it's the left, right? Yeah, open to the left. The Nancy Pelosi left. Yeah, it's like, yeah, no, it's, that's a good point. Yeah. And even then it's like he, then he sort of, and then he kind of buries the, buries the story. It's like, wait a minute, the Trump like White House. That's it was actually, you know, telling Twitter to take the tweets down. That's a, that's a different level of, of, of, um, meddling, I think then a campaign, you know, you have a sitting executive in the White House. That's an actual first and men, men, H people are like, well, they violated the first amendment. Well, okay, technically, I hate this whole fucking argument because this is where the libertarians were. It always defend private companies, I guess, till now, that they can do what they want because the first amendment supposedly doesn't cover private companies. Um, you know, technically, I think that's right. But in this case, Trump then is the one who is actually violating the first amendment. If you're going to be a purist about it by, um, that's true. And I don't think anybody's made that argument, which is a few people making it. Okay. But everything in journalism sucks, you know, today. So like, when you look at this story, you can't separate the story from the way people talk about the story. This is something Yashanai and my private conversation has been like complaining about for hours and hours of phone calls for a few years now and how depressing journalism is. So, you know, um, there are just so many bad people, look, I have a lot of reasons to dislike Matt. I mean, he tried very hard to throw me under the bus, stab me and back and so on. But like, um, the reasons that people are just violently hating this story and Matt are have to do with, you know, why are you helping, um, it's sort of like why are you helping the Trumpists or the right or why are you hurting the Democrats? You know, you've got, you're so bad. Now, but I think the real violation here, the real problem is why are you working with an oligarch and helping and basically, fronting for a very important, an oligarch's really important marketing campaign to try to drum up business for his failing massive investment, which could bring him down. Nothing could be greater than an oligarch going down in flames. And people pretending that we're investing like, no, no, this oligarch could really be good for free speech, you know, or he really believes in it, you know, he's already like anybody who called themselves Elon Musk already had their accounts deleted. You know, he's like, I'm a free speech. Um, uh, I've been no satire. No satire. No satire. And yeah, the Greenwald comes out, you know, the arbiter. Well, no, here I am. Uh, he's right. Satire's not covered, you know, you can be canceled for satire. That's fine. And it's just, Greenwald was upset because someone was pretending to be him. Oh, it's a satire. Someone did that whole blue check, you know, paid for the blue check. Right. And then, you know, called, he did the, and pretended to, you know, impersonated him and, and, uh, no, and Glenn Greenwald, you know, complained to Elon Musk to get this guy, um, you know, bad from the platform. So it's like the whole thing is a joke. You know, it's like, I like the people. There's always, there's always a limit to the free speech that you're willing to tolerate, you know, and as long as you're kind of in control of the free speech, these are, it's like, I don't know, free speech from these people is sort of like the free trade people, you know, like it's like, it's like free trade, free trade, but the freedom is on my terms only. Yeah. Yeah. And also, because it'll work for me, and I believe it will work in my favor. When it doesn't work in my favor, you know, I'll shoot you. You're strict. But, um, let's, let's, I don't know, there's sort of two parts of this story here that, um, we want to go into like Musk, but also Twitter. And one thing about Twitter, so when Musk took over Twitter, there was a lot of talk, including on the Radio Warner Facebook page, like, wow, is it really going under? And y'all should, you and I have a somewhat, um, we see things a little bit differently on this, I think, maybe, maybe not. But my own feeling is like, there's no way, there's no way at this moment, at least, um, I'll give you that, like, that, I don't know, the ruling class, whatever the hell you want to call it, is going to let Twitter, like, die overnight, like, like, you know, like East Germany, you know, the wall came down, and that was it with East Germany. I can't imagine if, except if it dies capitalistically, that they're going to let it die overnight, because it is a, you know, this is the subject of your, of your book. I mean, it's a major dual use weapon. I mean, just going back to its origins, you know, you see people like Matt and others saying, you know, in the early days, it was such a great, it had such promise. It was, it was fulfilling the Jeffersonian dream. Well, let me read you something from the early days. Here's June 2009, the Guardian headline. Now, this is during the, the, what are they called the green revolution or something in, um, in, uh, in Iran, right? That was the, that was before the Arab Spring. So the headline here, US confirms it asks Twitter to stay open to help Iran protesters. Obama administration asked Twitter website to postpone temporary shutdown. This is a very beginning of Twitter and it spread like wildfire, right? So the bomb is, I was even on Twitter back then, but yeah, I was, yeah, it was the early, early Twitter, early, very, very early Twitter. I only went on because the end is because, you know, why they, because they were posting all this stuff, like all these basically, like, I mean, who the hell, if I wasn't using Twitter, then who, who in Iran is using Twitter? It's like all these just basically some kind of, there was a big, but there was a big, you know, spooky kind of disinformation, influence operation running on Twitter to promote the green revolution. I remember that was a big thing and it was supposed to all be coming from inside Iran, but Iran was, you know, had like, his internet was being restricted and all this stuff. So it's like, you know, there were, yeah, so it was kind of important to, to, to create this, you know, to create this information, a sense of that Iran was on the verge of something huge and the words of being overthrown, you know, all of the protests were real. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, what I think happened was, um, that Twitter saw an opportunity through its deep relationship with people in intelligence. They saw an opportunity to expand their reach. I mean, it is, I mean, it is like the most dual use weapon of all. It's a dual use media global weapon. The, on the one hand, it is absolutely a commercial space and a information sharing space. And I have gotten plenty of information from it too. But on the other hand, it also can be used to subvert adversaries. And, you know, I'll read again the first three paragraphs. The Obama administration, while insisting it is not meddling in Iran, that's an early iteration of meddling, yesterday confirmed it asked Twitter to remain open because it was supposed to do sort of like a system update and go offline to help anti-government protesters. The company had planned a temporary shutdown to overhaul its service in the middle of the night, but the U.S. State Department put in a request to postpone this. Many protesters have been using Twitter to spread information about rallies and to share news. And governments couldn't really control this. And, you know, this is a, a company based in the U.S. It's like, I mean, it's like CNN times a thousand. Also, Twitter and Facebook and social media have a way of affecting your dopamine levels. Right? And making you think that, like, if you're being trolled on Twitter, you feel the same heat as if you're being bullied in a playground. Like, it's very, it has, it creates very immediate emotions. It has that effect. And so, when they were sharing this, they could create the impression to each other that their revolution was going to succeed and that they had power in numbers. You know, and there was some truth to it, but ultimately, you know, it got quashed, but Twitter played a role in sparking that. And because it was so successful, I mean, I'm sure it in Facebook were used in other instances. We know it was used. They tried using it in Belarus in 2010 and it was shut down. Antipooten, the first big protest that broke out in 2011 was very much American social media. There was a social media platform backed by the national endowment for democracy that was used in conjunction with Facebook to spread around information about vote fraud in the Duma elections of 2011. And it was probably real vote fraud, you know, just like Cozy Bear leaked real, you know, election fraud in the democratic primaries. But anyway, so for me, like, you have a weapon that powerful with global reach. It's just hard to imagine that they would just let musk, I mean, drive it completely into the ground. It could be bankrupted. It could be taken over by a consortium. Well, wouldn't okay. I mean, I'm kind of an outsider and could start to the amateur social media, but people expect this as one of their social perks and the technology is already familiar to a lot of professionals. So if Twitter died, wouldn't there be something else with a cutesy name that would pop up really soon? It's not that easy to get going, though. Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, in theory, yes, I mean, people would migrate to something that's already available, usually, you know, so maybe there's, I mean, I think because there are also the truth, these monopolistic operations that they basically suck, suck either buy out competition or just, you know, dominated by, you know, not because you need people to be on a platform and, you know, important people to be on a platform that people want to follow, right? At this point, because it's just everything is just celebrity culture. So I mean, I mean, I just do to to to to to yeah, exactly everyone will be the entire political Twitter will be on tiktok now, you know, having to do videos. It'll be actually a better, it'll be better, you know, than just these, it'll be, but the trichoms will control us. Yeah, exactly. All the data will go to the Chinese, you know, CCP. Yeah. But you know, look, there's with, there's different ways to kill something, right? I mean, you can kill something financially, you can run into the ground, you can bankrupt it, you know, and send, and since, you know, close it down that way, but you can also kill something spiritually. So I think if like, you know, a huge part of the liberal establishment, you know, leave Twitter, I don't see that really happening, but, but if they do leave Twitter enough, a lot of people leave Twitter and, you know, it remains a kind of, you know, just sort of an L. M. Musk sort of cult platform and, you know, there'll be some sort of, uh, Trumpists and anti-wokists, you know, just kind of using it. I mean, it'll be, it'll it'll be their little world, but it'll, it'll, it'll, it'll, oh, sorry, but also what I see a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of crypto people. Yeah, I don't quite get how the ideology lines up there, but somehow that's part of this. It's all, it's all these kind of like, Heinlein protagonist types, right? It's everybody who thinks that I'm a one man, you know, center of the universe protagonist. They're all rocking together, you know? They're all just out there rocking each other and everything, you know, it's pretty creepy actually, but, yeah, no, it's like, yeah, they're just all, you know, it's these, it's the cult of technology and the cult of the great man, you know, who deliver us from, you know, all our problems and, you know, innovate into the future and will, you know, help spread mankind all over the universe, you know, with his rockets and his space colonies and all this time, BP. So it's, it comes in with a crypto world because it's just this, it's part of the, that world, you know, part of the idea that all you need to do to say, to fix society, to change the world is just to develop new technology and, you know, crypto is supposed to be, it still is to, I think, to a lot of people, you know, that holds that promise that liberates money from governments and creates, you know, I don't know, there's like also just, you know, the blockchain will somehow create a, a radically transparent, decentralized, you know, like anarchist, crypto anarchist, you know, commune, I don't know, but they do believe in this stuff. And so, and it does overlap with, you know, with the musk cult in a big way. And musk, you know, was like, remember, he was, he was, he was, he was, he was part of the, like, the crypto cult, he was, you know, buying crypto. And you could, I think, buy Teslas with, you know, with Bitcoin and things like that. If I'm not mistaken. So he's part of that world. So I don't know, but, I mean, but you could kill Twitter by, by killing its audience or by killing the, it's spirit, essentially, of engaging with people don't want to be on there anymore. When that take time, it would take time. But if it could happen, I guess, I don't think so, because I think the majority of our political class, you know, of just, of the journalists and the media class are sort of, so just hopelessly addicted to Twitter, you know, so hopelessly addicted to like the, the rush that they get from that, from that platform. And, and basically think that, you know, this kind of performative politics is politics, this kind of performance that's in the spectacle that, that is enacted every day on Twitter, isn't actually like what a democracy looks like. It's just like calling people out and, and, and, you know, it, because that's what's, that's what's kind of sad about this whole thing is that like as bad as, you know, the kind of the intercept leaks were and as badly as they were handled, you know, I mean, they were essentially these NSA leaks, you know, Edward Snowden delivered these leaks to Glenn Greenwald, who then promptly privatized them, right, and put them under control of this other tech billionaire that now pay me. Another paypal mafia. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. This PayPal, another PayPal mafia billionaire who also met Taybe worked for, you know, strangely enough, and had like a good relationship with and still won't say a bad word about, despite him being essentially fired, you know, and, and kind of smeared on the way out of that of, of, of, of a magazine that he was supposed to set up for sort of under the intercept. But, you know, as badly as those were handled and they were privatized, no one really had any access to them, you know, the people, people like Greenwald basically controlled access to the art to, to the NSA archives. And we still don't even know what's in that archive fully because it's been essentially close to the public. The way that this is being handled is even worse than that. You know, it's like, we're getting, like, it's just being, it's being like released on Twitter. And it's the oligarch curating them. And it's the oligarch who is releasing it. I mean, anybody who puts, this just blows me away. People putting faith in an oligarch. No, he's, I know, it's like they have this personal connection with him. I know Elon and he really believes in free speech or he believes, and again, I remember this in Russia, there were good oligarchs and bad oligarchs. Oh, yeah. If you like Elon then, yeah, Soros is the bad oligarch. And vice versa, right? Very futile. Very, very futile. But, you know what, I just, because I lost my trade of, sorry, I lost my trade. I went on some kind of other tangent that I didn't need to go into. But, you know, but at least as bad as those leaks were, at least they had like, they were going to, they wanted to change something. They wanted to fix something, right? Like in society, which is that, you know, the Edwards node and whatever his motivations, you know, wanted to people to know that the NSA was doing the, there was this huge spying operation that they were doing, you know, most people that know they had a control. Yeah. Totally out of control. They had, they could like, they could bug any, you know, any, any access, you know, any Google account, any Apple account. I mean, all these big tech companies were partners to the, to this prism surveillance program. And so there was like, you know, there was at least, you know, a society could, it really benefit from these disclosures, right? Like in the sense that like, you know, and there was like, there was, you know, something that was almost like on the verge of something happening, you know, there was, it wasn't like totally partisan. It was both Democrats and the Republicans were, you know, kind of concerned with this. And there was clearly a kind of society why concern about the runaway surveillance powers. A lot of official death threats from people who mattered like, you know, it would be wonderful if we could kill this Snowden guy. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. And then Snowden, you know, really had to flee to Russia where he's stuck now for life, you know, most likely, right? So, but so it was an actual threat to power. And so, you know, and even though it was defanged in a kind of, and it's kind of a convoluted story, you've written about this, you know, low-wheel store, you know, work for Pando and NSW I've written it quite, you know, about the story of the Snowden story and kind of how it was defanged the threat that it posed to power very quickly and sort of was, you know, channeled into this like, oh, we just need to develop new security technology and new technology. You could do it. You could do it. So, it was just, it went into this sort of like realm where it opposes no real political power. But still, you know, at least there, like, society could in theory benefit from his disclosures. And that was sort of the, the idea but I don't understand what the hell this is all for. Like, who benefits from this, right? Who benefits from these leaks other than like just the spectacle benefiting it, right? So, like, the political spectacle and then everybody could get into their camps and denounce everyone, you know, call everybody, you know, sell out and, you know, or like just, you know, a power hungry, you know, wokists or whatever. Like, you know, people in America, like, what material benefit are they going to get from this? I asked myself that about a lot of journalism these days, most journalism, you know, it's about, yeah, and this one too. Like, I think Matt has been trying to make this kind of false case that the internet and Twitter were a, you know, were the sort of neutral free speech paradise until name your year. And then it started. Until the Democrats and liberals basically started meddling in them. And that's the theory. Here's the quote from his Twitter file series. This is number four. And it's typical of, well, something you see in Matt, I don't want to call it naivete because it's a self-serving naivete, but it, it's a kind of naivete, was Twitter in its conception was a brilliant tool for enabling instant mass communication, making a true real-time global conversation possible for the first time. In an early conception, Twitter more than lived up to its mission statement, giving people the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers. Yeah, there's classic golden age thinking there. You can almost hear the Twitter of birds and flowers growing around the frame of the photo as he talks this way. There's like, yeah, there's like a lawn, you know, a house with a picket wife, fence, and a father, a mother kind of barbecuing on the weekend, you know, two kids playing in the backyard, that kind of, but it's also it's like golden age thinking. It's great that you quoted that thanks for that because I think it's perfect because it's it also is, he's kind of appealing to the classic mythology of the internet, right? That the internet itself started out as this democratic technology, but it was corrupted by big corporations and was corrupted by, you know, big government. I mean, this is the classic libertarian or the classic narrative that's, you know, someone like Edward Snowden, you know, has and still thinks that, you know, that we and we need to bring the internet back to this classic golden age when it was free, when it was democratic, when everything was great. And obviously, and, you know, one of the things that I do in my book is I show that there was never that point really, you know, there there was like different, you know, there were different stages of the internet's evolution and growth, but at every point in the creation of the internet from its birth and in the military laboratory, right, to its owner to the fact that its wires were owned by, you know, military, military contractors from the beginning and tele and powerful telecoms from the beginning and that, you know, these even before these social media came around that the actual internet itself was, you know, owned by corporations and controlled by corporations and, and who, you know, kind of ran it in, in, in a lion's, with a good state. So they're, they're appealing to this thing that never actually existed. So he's, he's doing this classic thing. Yeah, he's doing the classic thing, which is again, and, and, and, and what's cause it's worse now, doesn't mean there was a golden age before. No, and what's the point? What is he going to return? So Twitter is going to, so his, his musk going to bring it back to this golden age. I mean, that's, that's the, that's the whole, that's, and that's kind of, and that's what, and that's what musk wants people to think, right? I mean, so he's, and this, and so by appealing to this, to this lost golden age that never really existed, he's actually falling in line with the, with the musk PR, PR machine, right? In that, like, and this is what's, this is what's so kind of gross about what Matt's doing. I mean, he is very consciously, I think, doing this and very cynically doing this. I don't know, because I guess he just likes to be part of the game and part of this, part of the spectacle and, and to be hated and to be loved, you know, to have like a cult of personality around him or something. Well, I mean, you mentioned Spide as a, as an aspect of policy before, and I can't help but read a lot of Spide in Matt's long march here. I think David Sarota said something good about if you decide to move to the far right just because you were offended by the left, that's not a very good reason or something on the, because we've all had our bruises from trying to, to move left and, and running into, and there's a lot, and I'd like to go out the left. Yeah, there's a lot not to like, but, but Matt, well, I mean, let's face it, you guys know better than I that Matt went through some trauma there, and I think he came out of it with a deep grudge. Absolutely. Well, the trauma was suddenly he wasn't, you know, a doored, and, and trying to throw me under the bus and, and say, you know, I was just innocent. It's the old, the old innocent thing again, everything there's innocent innocence here. That's always with all the innocence, right? I was innocent and Mark was this bad guy who corrupted me and, you know, and that didn't work. I mean, it didn't work because, because it was bullshit, you know, if, if Kathy Lally can, can call out your bullshit like a hack as, as like, lowly as Kathy Lally can expose your, for bullshit about that. I mean, you know, thing you got problems. And so I think he just, he just decided after that, like, well, people on the right are like, come over to us. We want to judge you. You know, and it's like, Mark, you know, you know, I mean, you know, because I actually never even met Matt, I mean, I've talked to him on the phone a couple of times and, you know, because I came to the exile after he had already left, right? And after there was the sort of, the, the kind of the split happened. And so I didn't, you know, I don't know him personally, but like you do, which I, but my sense of it just reading him and having read, read some of his, you know, some of the stuff, you know, if you look, look back at some of the stuff he's written, you know, with a kind of a behind sight. You know, he's a conservative guy at heart. It seems like, you know, he is, he is like, there's like a conservatism to him and he's comfortable in that, in that sense, he's comfortable in this almost like in this kind of the glory days of America. And he wants to restore America to some glory days. He might actually believe in it. It's not, like, purely cynical, you know, and he's not saying this stuff just, you know, it coincides. I mean, he can, he can own the lips and the lips that he canceled him, right, or tried to cancel him by, by, by being this guy, but it's actually like, there's like a, he's actually, he seems more comfortable there, you know, like it's like less pain somehow. I don't know, it's, it's, it's, maybe, maybe, I'm wrong a lot of liberals are kind of conservative like that too. Exactly, exactly, but they kind of have to do this, they kind of have to do this almost show, right, to be progressive and to have some kind of progressive values, but they're actually very, could be very pretty conservative and actually reactionary. And so in a way, like he doesn't have to do that anymore, he can kind of be conservative openly. What Yasha is saying makes a kind of sense. Like, if, if Matt's ideal placement would be somewhere within what we could call, I guess, the blue check world, well, before that acquired a new meaning with Twitter, that he was excluded from that, right, because of all the, of all the outrage, it was most intense among respectable upper middle class DNC people. It was during a, an NPR interview. I want to say that it started with Matt and he actually like, fed it foolishly. He's, he's a really great, can be a really great journalist and I, he's not always that all that sharp, I think. And he, he kind of, he got sort of called out, it was at Harvard. I mean, so this is like as blue checkies you get, I think it was at a Harvard discussion of his book with an NPR person in Boston, right? So this is like a solo court or all caps, you know, and that's where they first confronted him about the exile days. And then he ran home and composed, I think that was when it happened or sometime around that time he went home and like composed this 5,000 word, you know, mea culpa and it's all Mark's fault. And I wasn't even there. You know, I was innocent and corrupted and all this kind of crap. And, you know, and then Cathy Lally called out like all the stuff he did after even he left the exile. And then he just sort of moved the other way. I think there's something to what Yasha said, but I also think I talked with, I also think Matt as I knew him, he was a, I would say he was kind of a dyed in the wall, liberal, more on the left side of liberals as liberals were in the 90s. And, you know, although when we had the exile going, we sort of like, I mean, just the experience of getting deeper into the story there, plus mocking the hell out of it, obviously through every which way we did it, the exile, including, including trying to be the most horrible journalists, like the most horrible people around because all journalists were running cover for, I don't know, like a neo-liberal extermination campaign and selling themselves and also participating in all the debauchery that was going on there, but then presenting themselves as these angels, so we wanted to present ourselves as devils and get the story right. We just wanted to do everything the opposite. And I think his politics, you know what, they were kind of all over the place. There were times when Matt was more radical than I was on some things, I would say, kind of move more radically. But then there were other times he was constantly swinging all over the place. But one thing that I say, Matt, people like Matt, and I don't know, some other people that are kind of moving that way that I know who had been liberals and on the left, all their career and have kind of moved weirdly, rightward lately, they never really spent time with varieties. You know, there's one of the advantages, I think John and I had is being real right wingers when we were young. It wasn't contrarian. It was a people who tried to say, oh, you were just a contrarian. No, I mean, I really genuinely believed it. And anytime I got near those people, you had to flinch away from them. Yeah, yeah, because like you were for them in kind of a deep curdled loyalty, but at the same time not their music, not their clothes, not their culture, not their way of talking, not anything specific to them because those were all nauseous, really. Yeah. So they were kind of like simultaneously milk toast and boring in a way, but also like, I don't know, creepy or say, it just, it wasn't my world. So I never really hung out with them because I didn't want to. And that's the part that I find really hard to understand. Like Greenwald, I understand his slide back, I would say back to the sort of reactionary right, like at the kind of a kind of classic anti-authoritarian right. It was so he that's where he is. That's who he is. That's why, you know, Yasha, like we always knew that about him. He used to drive his crazy lefties, which is lying, I mean, there's so many lefties and anarchists, like they love to have some hero, whether it's Elon Musk or not of the left, but let's say, but you know, Chomsky or something. And then Greenwald has to be perfect. You know, I just, I'm coming from the right as a kid. I know when I smell one, it was so obvious. But Glennon knows that world and he's pretty much fine with it. And also they know how to kind of deal with each other. But I just look at somebody like Matt, who's never really spent time or other friends. I know who moved and started doing these like appearances at right wing rallies and stuff like that. I don't get how they can stomach it to be honest. I don't know. Like if it's your hatred of the libs that much that you can swallow, like, I don't know, being hanging out with these people. Yeah, I just remember all the all the Virginians in I don't want to insult any Virginians who happen to be sane people. But there was there was a big Virginia contingent among the second generation Neocons who were feeding off the the big salaries and the American University of Iraq when I was there. And I just remember we shared offices and one clean cut young fellow. And there is no other term for him than young fellow saying to another, I just don't feel right if I don't talk to grandma and grandpa every week. Even if you thought that and how could you think that? Don't say it. What what is going on here? They're just really hard to relate to, very hard to relate to. And that's a part that I don't quite get. But I just think, you know, from what I knew about Matt, I mean, I thought I knew him well. I thought it was, it was, you know, it hurt when he left the exile in a way that was just very much like a, it was like a big fuck you. And he now, you know, retroactively tries to claim is because somehow he, he did not approve of like what I was writing, which is just pure horse shit. He just, I think he understood what I left for about a year wasn't Kentucky working on my book. I was, you know, I had to recover from enormous amounts of drug use, abuse, like enormous amounts. And by the time I came back, he didn't really want to be there anymore. And I think he just sort of understood. He had lost kind of interest in the whole Russia thing. And look, Matt, it's not like I came from poverty at all. I thought I, I thought I came from, you know, relative to some people, some privilege. I mean, it was like, we were middle class in an upper middle class area. So we had our own little traumas, but there were nothing compared to, you know, some other people go through. But I didn't know what privilege really meant to I met Matt and spent some time with him and his dad and stuff like that is the real aristocracy. That's the media aristocracy. I mean, everybody would kiss Matt's ass from like the media blue check world because of who his dad was. I've never seen, never met anyone like that, never seen anything like it. And back when we started the exam, Matt was very, he was almost kind of mostly a little bit almost embarrassed about it. But when I left and came back, it was more like, what the fuck am I doing here in this podunk Russia shit haul with this, you know, exile, which is kind of already done everything it could do for us, but now it can only like cause me problems because he knew that anytime he came back to the US, he was going to step into the blue check world. Well, yeah, I think that was the key, getting back to the US because it you were saying a while ago that actually a lot of people read the exile and were following the exile. But you never got that sense at the time. It was more like these people are in Moscow, they don't matter. They in a way, I think it helped us because we could say whatever we wanted. It was like we were firing pistols at a target range that opened onto the void. And we were in a hard bunker. Yeah, why not? But at the same time, I just had this feeling anyway that nobody was listening and that it didn't matter. And it I didn't see why cause you could transmit an article in milliseconds all over the world. But it turned out that way like when we got back to the US, even though it took some time, it was like people did listen more carefully and Matt, I think knew that more deeply than certainly than I did anyway. Yeah. Well, you know, it has to be remembered that Matt was, he was not 100 Thompson. Like he, you know, where he is telling the truth is that at least in his public personnel or his literary personality, let's say, the way that the the newspaper was sort of divided up, his literary personality was not very hunter Thompson. And I think it kind of annoyed him that his literary, you know, he did do a lot of wild stuff under different pseudonyms and so on. But I think it kind of annoyed him that people liked the more wild stuff. At least, you know, it was more popular, I would say, right? And that I did definitely annoy him. So when he, when he left, I remember he said that when he was going to start up this exiled paper and buffalo that he wanted to do it like Harper's with no or not Harper's or the con with something like that where nobody had a byline and he was going to go completely the other way. And I think they tried doing that at first and then he thought, no, I'm going to go the 100 Thompson way and he started like, I was getting reports back. I just didn't pay attention to it because I was kind of, you know, just sucks of a guy who you think is your friend just, you know, Foxy like that. I mean, it's just, you know, it's something it's never good feeling. I just want to add something sorry, just because I think, because he, in that first to add to this idea that he's no 100th Thompson or he would maybe resend that, you know, and he kind of understood that. He wrote in this, I'm sorry, I'm just laughing because I just can't because I just read, I just looking at this text now, just laughing again. He in this, I think initial apology that he posted on Facebook, which is like, you know, thousands of thousands of words long. You know, he had this, this really, really pathetic segment, which he kind of says what you're, what you're talking about is that like, okay, I'm going to read it. I'm going to read it. It's a paragraph and a half here. It's like, it took all those years at the exile to learn that that this unvarnished, unvarnished on the ground reporting style was where I had something to contribute. He's saying that he's actually just like a, just a regular reporter at heart, not like a wild guy, you know, that this unvarnished on the ground reporting style was where I had something to contribute while in other areas, like trying to be cool or offering commentary on sex or gender relations or being a public personality. It was clear I had nothing to offer to anyone. This is what just a few years ago, just a few years ago. And this is, and this is why if you scan YouTube, you will not find video of me hanging with actors or parting at nightclubs or really doing anything at all outside the confines of my job. I have a beautiful family, three young children and a brilliant and caring wife. I mean, this is good. So this is the kind of stuff that he was just trying to tell people that he wasn't the wild guy that he wasn't Hunterous Thompson basically. You did his Hunter Thompson thing after. That's what I'm saying. That was so weird to me. I mean, and I had all these people from the New York media world riding me. And it was again, like John was saying, the nice thing about Moscow is you could, like I didn't really want to know how the ex-haw was read because I wanted influencing me and I just wanted to put it out and then go back and hide and then fire and melt it. Yes, exactly. And I would get these notices every so often, increasingly. Like basically, first it was people I knew in the New York media world, Matt stealing your act, which was the weirdest thing. I was like, Matt, he's writing about taking drugs and being wild and trying to be disgusting and stuff like that for the New York press. I was like, you got to be kidding me. And because that was what he claimed that he had to stop doing that. That's how we got the game. And that's how we got the rolling stone as I understand it because John Wiener had at best a dim idea of these things. And Matt seemed 100 Thompson enough for him. I mean, I think that was, if I remember Kathy Lalley's like 10,000 words read against us, which is so many problems of its own, but whatever. That was one of her main points. Like, you became, from her point of view, at least she tried to argue that because she still upset over the prank we played on her. He became more openly misogynistic and 100 Thompson and Gonzo after leaving the exile. Whereas he tried to blame it all on the exile. And that wasn't really the case. But what you did, by the way, do some really brave things at the exile. I want to give Matt credit here. I remember a series he did where he worked as a brick layer in some miserable city for a week. And he was tough. He was like physically tough. And he could, and his Russian seemed really fluent. And he was capable of doing stuff like that. But he didn't seem to value that, especially. That was, that was what struck me as weird. If I, if I was tough enough to do that and fluent enough to do that, I, I never would have shut up about it. But that, that wasn't what he really wanted. It felt like, I think he wanted to come back and take his place. But he didn't want to do it where it was sort of too easy. You know, he didn't want it to be handed to him. He wanted to make his own mark. And, you know, to his credit, he worked hard. A guy puts out, he's like a graph a man who puts out shit, tons of words all the time. It's not like anybody who's just born into that privilege automatically makes it. You do have to put stuff out and you have to be pretty good about it. But yeah, Matt did other piece. I mean, I remember one of my favorite pieces. He spent time at a collective farm. I think I want to say it was in the Crestland or regional when we went out and hung out with General Alexander Leibbitt. And we entered, we went around. We found this collective farm that was still like operating barely. And we found out that there were cattle rustlers stealing whatever horses were left. Horses especially. And also cattle. But also horses as I recall to make horse meat and kumis to sell it to like, I don't know, mongoles or two vans. I can't remember who they were selling it to. Central, what we would call central Asians who value, you know, horse meat and horse milk and fermented horse milk. And basically there was an inside job going on within the call hose. And it was sort of like the very, it was like the last story about privatization you could possibly tell. It was very well done. And he did a story once about getting drunk at a nuclear like a nuclear missile base somewhere in the urals. And he got so drunk with those people, he passed out like on the like the switchboard or something, you know, on the switchboard, like passed out somebody was vomiting in there. You know, those are some great stories. But you know, I could understand as someone who comes from the sort of elite media background and from that world where you know, he's basically he's like, you know, he's like a rich guy doing, you know, stories about poor people. And like, which is sort of like, you know, which is a lot, which is a lot of journalism is like that and a lot of like documentary filmmaking or any kind of, I don't know any kind of, it's just that's such a big part of it. But it's maybe not that satisfying, you know, because you're not. Yeah, you're not like, which I kind of respect actually, because it's like, it takes nothing to get access to, you know, like basically a nuclear missile plant. I mean, it just just shows how, you know, like for someone, you know, like in Russia, especially in those times that you can just get access pretty much to anything with some vodka and a smile, basically, right? And to be a foreigner, you know, it's already exotic. It's like to be a foreigner in Russia, even even these days sometimes, it's basically a celebrity, you know, it's like being Tom Cruise or something, you know, he's just a for, he's just a someone from America. And so you can act that. So I guess I could see why he could sell him shock therapy even exactly. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And you could I could see why he wasn't, you know, kind of to his credit that's I kind of respect that to be honest, because it just because so many people, you know, like that's kind of what that's what that's the level at which they stay, you know, throughout their careers, which is basically just exploiting access to poor people and and their poverty and ignorance, you know, to like, and to yeah, but I don't know, going from that to working with Elon Musk, which is a circle almost. Yes. So it's a no its its own way. Yeah, yeah, I agree, I agree. I don't understand that I got to say I just I just don't understand it at all. And I honestly see like I think there's something to all the psychological things we're saying, but I honestly just think it's cool. It's really material based. Exactly. I wanted to actually say something about that because like I it's you know, I you forget how like yeah, like how insulated the exile was from the world and like no one cared about like you need people, you know, we wouldn't even know how many people read an article online rather than like obsess about the statistics about you know, and who the people were who were reading the article, you know, where they were coming from. So you could like tailor your content, you know, tailor your writing to capture even more, right? And make more money from them. And so I think, you know, I used to kind of scoff a little bit about all this talk about, you know, being radicalized by algorithm or being radicalized by YouTube. But I think there's something to be said about Matt and not just Matt, I think he actually fits into kind of a there's a general trend with this subscriber driven, this subscription, you know, direct subscriber driven or listening to driven driven business model for journalism that's really just taken over, right? Where you're radicalized by the algorithm, right? You're radicalized by the by the audience market, right? And what they want to hear. And so when he started kind of moving more, to the right, I guess, or anti liberal, he became kind of anti liberal or, you know, his, it like there's a huge market there. You know, there's a huge audience there and a huge number of people who are willing to pay real money. You know, these people, these are people with money and a lot of spite and a lot of hatred. So when you have like a kind of a former liberal like, like Matt, who starts moving that direction, it only gets sort of, it's, it begins to snowball, I think. And I just say this to someone who, you know, I write on some stuff. So I kind of know how easy it is to be captured by that, to be captured by the, you need to go there. Or you need to sense yourself like the vaccine, for example, unless you're already with them, if you're with a mainstream press and you have a cushy job, then it makes a lot of sense to talk about whatever you really believe, you know, you're for the Vax, right? And you're for mandates or whatever the fuck. But if you don't have that job and you rely on audiences, you will see that you'll either gain audience if you're anti-vax or you'll lose audience. If you say I really think, you know, people should mask up and it's a good thing. There's just, you won't have money. Yeah. So. And actually, if you're like anti-liberal, if you're critical of liberals, but yet you're like, you know, pro mask, you're not going to gain an audience basically. No, actually, there's, there'll be nowhere. Yeah. Right. Yeah. You'll be nowhere. And I kind of, and I've got to be honest, that's sort of the situation where I find myself in, in this world, basically nowhere. You guys have probably heard that, well, you probably saw this happen that Matt topped a million followers on Twitter. He jumped 300,000 followers, I think in 24 hours when he made, what was essentially a profession of faith to the right? Because that's how an awful lot of people interpret it like he went to Elon Musk who's the, the pope of this particular schism of the right. And he said the prayers made the vow melt down. And boom, he was over a million followers. And they celebrated it as such as, you know, the rewards of declaring failty. And there, one thing I'll say about the right is they, yeah, once you join, yeah, you're, you're in. You can do it. You want, they take care of you. Yeah. Like the left, the left looks for a thousand different reasons why you have something wrong or why you shouldn't be part of the club or basically why you shouldn't be paid. Because it's just, yeah, it's the left is pretty damn awful in that way. And they're not, they don't stand up for you for the most part. And some areas that's gotten a little better in the last few years than it used to be. There's no money though. There's no money though. Yeah, that's the, that's the thing. There's no money there at all. And so you kind of like, you know, and if you, I mean, I just noticed it's like the reactionary asked like parts of the audience because, you know, anyone who, like a lot of the people who subscribed to Substacks or who are active on Twitter or following this stuff, I mean, there are already news junkies and they're kind of, it's a pretty, it's already a kind of a pretty limited part of the population, you know, to be so, you know, like into this stuff, right? Like, to, you know, to be so fanatical about it. You know, and so those people are, I don't know, there's a lot more, you know, people, I think on the reactionary side on sort of the then, then I don't know on the left side. Oh, and then talent is thin over there. Let's face it, you know, they, they don't have a lot. I mean, there's, there's a kind of embarrassment. It's like when I was young, many, youngs ago, there was a move that people would make from sort of rock to country when, when things ran out on them. And they would be given a second life, you know, as pop stars, because it was easier at that time. It was a more accepting and forgiving audience. And there, there's a similar move you can make now, like, when you go to the right. No, and you get, yeah, and you see it. So there's all these different things. Yeah, I totally agree. And there's, I guess it's also with comedians. It's, it happens too, right? Like the comedians who kind of, you know, just basically go become, become right-wing pundits or go to the right. Dennis Miller, Dennis Miller, as his career, like, went down the fucking toilet. And Bill Maher in a way too, I guess, yeah, yeah, just to maybe a lesser degree. And I mean, yeah, so there's like the same thing with kind of YouTube star, you know, YouTube celebrities and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and kind of like anti-liberal, um, uh, influencers, right? Like that there's, it's only a small step you have to take to kind of join the right. Uh, you don't really need to, you just have to kind of be quiet about certain things and, and throw them, you know, like, like what Matt did with that, you know, the left parentheses, the Democratic party. Helping Musk, I mean, you know, the way it is today in the camps, like, you really stand up for your oligarchs or your lease. I mean, it's, everybody's got this sort of authoritarian thing. But, you know, ultimately this was just, again, this was a giant marketing event, more than anything. It was a very important big lucrative marketing event where an enormous amount of social capital was acquired by both parties. What is Twitter really about from the investor's point of view? I mean, it's a business. It's a business like Facebook, like Google search. I mean, Google search is a great search. It allowed us to get all this information. But what was Google? Google's an advertising, it's like an advertising and marketing. Just it's advertising platform period. Exactly. It delivers it delivers it. That has a dues. But it's a, it delivers targeted advertising to the thing that you want at the moment you want it. I mean, that's sort of the picture. And Twitter does that. And Facebook did, like it, and that is how the radicalization happens because all of this is so much about, in the marketing world, about creating demographics and bunching them together in order to link them up then with certain advertisers that need that particular niche. And so, you know, it forces us to be less complex in our beliefs because of the way that the fucking algorithms work and pushes us more and more into camps that are more packageable and sellable to companies that want to advertise. And so we become more polarized, but really we've just become more demographicized. And what, what must did, must cuisine, you know, there are real things also that are going on on the top. This is such a powerful platform along with a few others that like when people get canceled from it and because Twitter is more liberal, it was more right wingers and not sees and so on. You know, we're being de-platform. They can lose their business and so they were complaining. And they wanted, you know, hero musk to come in and save their free speech rights. And you're seeing ever since musk started taking control, I follow a lot of different accounts. I try and follow, you know, right left and whatever, for various reasons on different stories. All the righties, all they do is go right to musk and try and get, hey, cancel this person, cancel. Like before Musk took over, it was all complaining about free speech and cancel culture and how horrible liberals are for canceling. And now all they wanted to do is cancel everybody. They've been having flame wars with. There was even like, there's like a master list being circulated of all like the Antifa. Everybody wanted canceled. And Tifa, like the Antifa council, you know, the greater Antifa council needs to be. It's, it's exactly. No, it's totally no. It's just it's about, again, it's like, it's like, it's like we want free speech on our on our terms. And we have, you know, we want our enemies canceled. So there's no real difference to it, you know, and, and, and ultimately musk, you know, some musk is, we're learning he's also kind of a dumb shit. And it's weird to think for some people, I guess anyway, I mean, we've been trying to say in the show of an over, having seen billionaires pop up quick more quickly in Russia and then just, I don't know, following the stuff like billionaires are just weirdos. Some of them can be smart, some can be shrewd. But they're all weirdos and sick and sociopathic. And a lot of them aren't even really that smart when it comes down to it. Musk, the richest oligarch, you know, it just, it exposes the meritocracy. Also, the richest are, you know, this whole like, that is if he's the richest is based on this sort of, I don't know, the stock price of Tesla and all this bullshit. It's like, which is, I mean, it's like this for this wealth is just, he can't really, I mean, he can, I guess he can take, he can, you know, clearly, he can take it down by linking, by hitching it all to his Twitter and Twitter. And Twitter, yeah, exactly. I mean, unless he, unless musk, unless musk, basically wants to completely fund Twitter's, you know, expenses going forward and decouple it from the advertising business that it's, you know, it's, I mean, as it stood like, Twitter was barely, you know, barely breaking even. And it's not like, it's not flush with cash. It was never flush with cash like, Facebook or like, Google were, you know, so it's always, it was always like the odd, kind of platform that was, you know, mon, you could monetize it, but only up to a point. And it was always struggling just because it is, it is a weird platform, you know, like, it's just, it's, it's hard to target people, you know, people don't really click, I don't know how many, I don't even know why people click on ads there. It's kind of, I know. But, but like, but brands at, you know, clearly want their stuff out there. And there's a, you get a lot of, I don't know, I personally get a lot of like entertainment stuff, like a lot of movie ads and things like that. I don't know if that's mean, particular or that's, but anyway, it was always like, not the most lucrative platform to begin with. Even then, you have these companies and like, your advertisers, you know, do wheeled power over over your, over your business because they're the ones funding it essentially, right? I mean, they're the one providing the revenue. And so they, if they don't want, they're like, you know, Disney plus to the latest Star Wars to have like, you know, Kanye's swastika, you know, right next to it, right? Like, it's going to be a problem for your image. And so I could, and so there is a limit to what must must can do in terms of speech, right? In terms of like hateful speech and things like that. Unless he wants to just come out and fund this thing out of his own pocket, which he's not going to do, right? No. And so there's not going to let this drag down his whole empire. And so I mean, he's already backtrackin so many ways. Backtrack, oh, a lot of things. And so this is only like a month, like, you know, it's at least it took Dorsey years to keep, you know, cutting back, more and more and more. I mean, remember, like all kinds of countries around the world, request and get Twitter to take down, you know, talk about the first amendment in the state, to take down tweets. And they've been doing this for years and years and years. We don't talk about it much. But again, my point is basically this is a, this is a marketing platform. What Silicon Valley wants when you come to them with any media proposal, and this media, and I mean whether it's media or, you know, social media, whatever is eyeballs. How many eyeballs is your business proposal going to bring? And Twitter, like Twitter has not been as successful as Facebook in converting those eyeballs into revenues, as you said. But it's still something and it definitely has power. Like it has a really unusual power because there's an unusual ability to mobilize, emotionally mobilize people to like tap into on a mass instant level, people's dopamine squirts. And get them to do shit. Like that's why, you know, USAID funded a Twitter knockoff called Zunzunia. They were busted in 2014 over this, basically the CIA to create a Twitter in order to destabilize Cuba to then it was all on the business plan. It was all there. This is going to get all these kids excited. First, we're going to do all kinds of celebrity stuff through music. Then it's going to be like something you wait for the hooks. You know, the police will always wind up beating somebody up too much. Somebody will get killed. Something will happen. And then you organize anti regime rallies. And this will work because it's already been proven to work. And like Arab Spring, you know, was like, you know, seen as a kind of a social media uprising. And you can really do, I mean, these things are what they're great at is, yeah, like over some kind of very simple issue, getting, you know, mobilizing people and getting people outraged, right? And and it may be even delivering a crowd to appear somewhere, you know, like that's the, you know, in the best case scenario, you can do that. I mean, these things are really effective at that. Yeah, they're there. It's it's good for sparking the first stage of insurgencies. What's kind of sad about it is that, you know, in the aftermath of the first Gulf War, there's that famous event, which, which was quite real, where US planes flew over Iraqi Kurdistan and the Shia regions. It's a seven tossing out millions of leaflets saying rise up. And they knew at the time that when these people rose up, they would eventually be exterminated. And I think like as in Iran with the green revolution, there was no plan that these flash mob type riots would would really work to change the regime. Essentially, you're sacrificing a lot of people. Yeah. Yeah. But that's not really an issue when these things are decided. What happened, I think, with Matt's thing was, again, it was a a marketing, a, you know, global marketing platform, dual use weapon, whose business was being destroyed, like right before our eyes by this idiot musk. And he needed a campaign event to turn that around to change the conversation. To rescue his, his dumb shit investment investment into this platform. I mean, it's like, if, you know, if it was Trump, you know, it's like his failing me, you know, failing media company. It's like, that's what he's doing. He's like helping a loser, basically, trying to like rescue his investment. I mean, and, you know, and then on the other side, again, like I questioned the, the usefulness of these leaks, because then you have to like trust the source, right? You have to trust that Elon Musk is giving them access, you know, unfettered access. And then this unfettered access, you know, filtered through like Barry Weiss and Matt Taibi is like, you're actually getting an accurate picture of what's actually being discussed there and what's being hidden, you know, I mean, they're already like staying Jack Dorsey is innocent and all this stuff like, and then he didn't know what was going on, like, which is, it sounds pretty dubious to me, you know, that they see of a company is not involved in the decision of this magnitude to censor a story about, you know, you know, 100, 100, 100 Biden. Anyway, there's just like, again, like the, from, from, you know, Matt is like, you know, he's writing on his journalistic credentials, right? And he has this pioneering journalist, he's, and like he's doing like a very corrupt thing, you know, he's selling out to Elon Musk, and he's, as far as the public is concerned, it's getting like these little bits and pieces of what's actually there. And there's no way to, you know, to check it, right? There's no, you're not even getting like full access to the documents. So again, it's like, it's like, we're like, we're, it's even a more degraded version of what was happening with the intercept. I mean, yeah, at least the in a set wasn't a meteor, you know, overseeing the documents. Yes. To me, it's the, it's one of the most damning things. I mean, it's like he's, yes, he's dealing, he's, he's making a deal with a billionaire. And it's a corrupt deal. And, you know, and he's positioning it as some kind of noble leak that these documents are being leaked for the public to expose this corruption inside and collusion between a private tech company and though the Biden administration or the Biden campaign and the Democratic Party and all this stuff. But in reality, it's like the, you have to trust him and you have to trust Elon Musk and you have to trust other people in that in that whole chain. And then frankly, I mean, I don't know, like it's, and no one can really verify it. I mean, it's, and that's the thing. It's like, if he was actually, I don't know if he had some integrity, I don't know, I don't want to use that work because I just think it's a joke at this point. If he had some integrity, like he'd, you know, he'd say like, no, Musk, you know, like I'll do the deal with you, but you got to hear my conditions. You know, you got to deliver to me the whole archive, you know, I got to make sure that it's a full archive. And it's not like just cherry picked by you because I, you know, I don't want to just, you know, report your version of events. And, you know, and if, if you don't agree to that, well, no deal. And I'm going to leak this conversation to the public, you know, for the public sake to show that you're trying to like manipulate journalism, trying to manipulate the media into, into, into presenting a one sided narrative according to Elon Musk, right? I mean, that's what a real journalist is. That's the exile version of this would be all about his talks with Elon Musk and how ridiculous this guy is. And how this guy's trying to use him and how he's trying to use him exactly. But this version is like, this is, you know, the big leagues, these, these are two big businesses like helping each other. Exactly. It's synergy, man. It's synergy. And I really do think that like, you know, I don't know, just I've been following Matt, you know, on and off. And like last few years and it's just I do really think that he is really excited. He's happy to be with the big boys. You know, he's he's he's like, when Elon Musk is in his, is in his replies and like saying, Oh, yes, Matt, yes, Matt, agree, Matt. Like, it's like, you know, you have the richest man in the world, right? This, you know, this just basically telling you that you're smart and I read you and I get my information from you and I agree, you know, it's like, that's got to be the biggest dope. It feels like it's that's the biggest rush that he can get at this point and he loves it. He and he loves being at the table with them and he loves being kind of appeared to them, you know, to appear to be like Elon Musk. That's one thing I always saw and always shocked. It shocked me at first because Matt just seemed like a regular guy kind of and funny guy like, you know, he was fun. He was a fun guy. He was a lot of fun. But yeah, are you are you thinking of the Duma appearance? There's the Duma appearance. But there's also just like anytime we met these a list reporters and then he'd hang out and play tennis with like a list bankers and stuff and it was and I didn't hold, you know, a reporter should do that. It's just that for me, it was like not coming from the aristocracy of the media world or any kind of aristocracy of anything. It weirded me out. I felt uncomfortable and that around those people. I felt I just felt uncomfortable and I and I just, you know, compensated by just getting like incredibly high every time I'd be around them and kind of half being there mentally. Matt was very comfortable with them and liked them a lot, liked hanging out with them and you know, that's something that you just, I don't know, that's something that you're that you're raised with. I remember about a year after we started the exile. He was like, yeah, my dad is setting up a meeting with Graydon Carter who was I think still that I think he was still that editor of Spy Magazine, you know, about Spy doing something with us and I was just like that was just such a, I had no idea that there were people in the world who can have their dead call up Graydon Carter and set up a meeting to talk about. And I didn't know such thing existed. And so yeah, I think I think he's comfortable around that world and I think he likes being in that world and exerting some influence or believing in his mind that he exerts some influence, you know, positive influence and also like that they have some of the same tastes and some of the same pet peeves and it's man, it's just it's it's there's a real class culture in this country that is still barely kind of understood and it's to me and that's what that's about. Yeah, I mean, I finally can like end on a like a happy political thing here. Okay. What's that? I have no no. No, no, I mean, I guess it's a happy, you know, I mean, I do think that, you know, I just think that platforms like Twitter, you know, they're good for the media class. I mean, I in a sense, I guess they're good for us, you know, people like us who make money off of this stuff and and but they are like a net negative for the world and I mean, it is the sooner these things fucking die and disappear, you know, the better it is for for everyone because I what I mean, I look at Twitter, you know, you dip into it and you see that like, you know, the people who are kind of interested in politics, you know, want to like be involved in some way, you know, like want to have some sort of involvement in the process or at least feel like they're involved, you know, all their energies are being sucked into this spectacle, you know, this just this, it's a never ending spectacle, you know, like this platform. What's that? Into a marketing platform. Into a marketing platform, but also like a kind of, it's almost like dopamine roller coaster. It's a it's almost a counterinsurgency tool on a much more bigger political level, right? Because it just sucks out people's energy, you know, the ones who have any, you know, actually, interestingly, the so few people actually are actually interested in politics, right? And a lot of these people are concentrated on platforms like this because there's nothing else. There's nothing in their town. There's nothing in a locally to be involved with, not really, you know? And so there's they're like, they're sucked into these platforms that just take them on this roller coaster right? Yeah, on this dopamine roller coaster ride and then have convinced them that this is the real politics, right? This is where this stuff happens and this is the reality and people like, we look at imperialism here if we expose this one, I know. And it's just as long as you yeah. And so it's it's kind of it's pretty sad to watch. I mean, it's it's a pretty grim, it's a pretty grim place because it is at the end, it's like, I mean, I don't know, you know, what John, you have anything to say to this because I do think on some, it's like a political you know, neutering platform, you know, like where you just take people who have, who have, who might have, you know, be active politically in some, on some level, and you just, you just take a was that, sap them of their energy and like, and you'd read it. Well, yeah, I think of it in more of a literary metaphor, but it's roughly the same. Like, at first, I tried being on Twitter and it was very exciting because as I've said before, it was probably the only place I've seen in my life where training in free verse actually paid off. I mean, you could do free verse on Twitter and it was powerful, but it started to make me sick after a while and I started to feel like, I didn't get to be part of the high school cafeteria clicks when I was in high school, and I'm damned if I'm going to do it now and waste whatever literary energy I have on making mean cafeteria one-liners that kind of make me feel bad when I'm lying in bed at the end of the day. So I just kind of got off. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's a smart thing to do. It is a smart thing to do. I'm just there because for, really, for promotion for marketing. I use it, I try to use it to market, you know, our shows and some of that just means blowing off some steam, saying stuff that's on your mind at the time. But like, yeah, in the early, early time when I first started using it, it was actually a lot more emotionally thrilling and sickening and I would get off it for a while and people would, you know, you'd get smeared on it and then you're supposed to join up with other people and smear somebody else. No, that was just, just fucking gross. But I'm so like kind of emotionally and otherwise disconnected from it. I just, I don't know, I guess I just have a generally bleak view that it's sort of like so many other horrible things in this world. It's just part of our world and, you know, you use it to try to get extract what little benefit for yourself and try to minimize the damage. And, you know, once in a while you actually meet somebody decent through it, I met some decent people through it, decent people and media and labor. You know, I met somebody who's Ukrainian, who's been like, we've had different friends who needed help, including like this, you know, escapees from the war. Like, there's been a few of those things. They don't make up for the general horror of the site. But, yeah, no, I mean, look, there's always positives to it and you do need, and it's, I have actually met some people who are now my friends through there. You know, so there is because you get to see people's, I don't know, interests and, you know, and the same thing could be said about Facebook and all these different social, so there's like a, I mean, kind of the original, the most, the most benign and kind of positive part of them is that they are kind of social networks and you can connect with people who share similar interests and, you know, people you'd never meet in real life and would probably be impossible to meet in real life just because of how atomized everyone is at this point, you know. So they've taken the place of that. So I totally agree, but unlike a, unlike a bigger societal level, you know, it's like the, this, and in particular, you know, I mean, Twitter in particular, because it's just such a politicized, you know, like, like just a manic kind of almost like a bipolar kind of platform, you know. I just, how much energy it sucks for sex out of the political process and just how, how tightly, you know, how tightly integrated it is with sort of the political new cycle, right? Just because it is a journalist platform, a journalistic platform and things are there. So yeah, but I just, I just, I don't, I don't really, I don't really, I don't really, I'm like, you know, it's like, I don't really, it doesn't really surprise me that powerful interests, you know, that are that are elites or the people who run this country, you know, have sway over over such a, such a powerful platform. It's kind of obvious that they, they, they'd have some control over it, you know, just like, it's part of the, it's part of the media system, you know, and, you know, despite what people kind of think about journalism and, you know, this kind of, I don't know, like this, I don't know, this, this kind of golden age of journalism, concept of what, of what, of what, what newspapers are and what journalism is, it's like not, you know, for ever since newspapers were invented or the technology was invented, they were owned by people who had money by capital and by local business people, by local oligarchs, you know, if you look at like the history, local history of any city in America, like I'm here in San Francisco, and you look at the history of journalism here, it's like the newspapers are owned by the oligarchs, you know, by the Hearst, you know, who own the minds, um, um, and, you know, it's like they're tightly connected to the oligarchy. And so it's not surprising that in, in today when, you know, we live in an oligarchy society that a platform like Twitter that's owned by oligarchs and controlled by them, it would be also be captured by them on some level. So it's like, you know, this, that's why I feel like this, you know, the, the scandal that's the, this Twitter scandal, you know, it's like it's just really not that surprised. I don't know what people expect. I don't know. It's like next thing you're going to tell me that, you know, there's oil oil lobbyists in the EPA, you know, it's the, it's a shocker, you know, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's, it's at least a good thing is that we move beyond the point where people thought it was a conspiracy theory, right? To say that. Yes. No, I social media or the internet is tied in with, you know, I mean, it's like the, you got the richest man in America, but the fucking about the fact that he's supposed to be like, he, but he's against the deep state. This guy would like run Starlink, which is what like when we interviewed Seth Harp, it was a journalist, you know, for Harpers who was out covering the war. I mean, he was, he was talking about how Balitzky, the neo-Nazi guy who upfound As of Battalion, was like right in front of him getting on his Starlink phone so we could contact directly people in Maru Opal and then also other people to recruit new As of Regiment people like this is, this is the Nazis with the Liberals, right? And it's, and they're all communicating things that Elon Musk, I mean anyway, all this, it's just, I mean, that is not, that we're choosing all our areas. Not just Starlink, I mean, he's, look, he's, so he's, he, he runs SpaceX, right? Which is, you know, basically delivering these highly classified payloads, basically surveillance satellites, right? Spice satellites, you know, for the National Reconnaissance Office, it's like, I think the contract's worth like, $300 million. I mean, these are like the most highly, you know, this is like the most highly secret of things you can possibly imagine in terms of technology. You know, he's the guy who is delivering them into space. So he's like, yeah, the idea that he's anti, you know, anti-lead, the idea that he's like, yeah, against the deep spate, I mean, state, he's a, he's like, he runs like a small lock-heed Martin kind of outfit, you know? Like a startup, a lock-heed Martin startup, you know, that would, in some, in some older world would probably be bought up by like Raytheon or whatever, you know, like, I mean, so he's the idea that this guy is some outsider is a joke. And so now, the guy who is tightly integrated with the military industrial complex with the military and with American intelligence agencies, he owns Twitter, you know? So who has a direct line to who now? You know, it's like, you know, it's like, that's, you know, there's a, there's a level of integration there actually that I don't think even exist, it didn't exist before he bought the company. Right. I mean, there was some distance at least between, between, between these two things. And now it's like the guy who, yeah, so this whole thing is a joke. That's what I mean is like, just Twitter, it just sucks you into this. It's almost like, you know, you know, it Twitter reminds me of sometimes, and I think this is actually you've getting his idea. It's like a perky pat layout. Yeah. Right. We're all in there just, you know, stuck together actually in the bodies of these, of these dolls. And we have to kind of enjoy ourselves. Yeah, we have to enjoy ourselves, but we're all miserable and bickering. That's a miserable enough note. Not miserable enough for any show. Yeah, we went on a while. Well, thanks. Yasha Levine for joining us. Go to check out Yasha's yasha.substac.com and also podcast the Russians. And buy his book, Surveillance Valley. Thanks. Yeah. Anyway, thanks for joining us. Thank you.
