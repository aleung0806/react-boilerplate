    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. The day today is February 17, 2023 and this is episode 367. You're listening to Radio Warner at patreon.com forward slash radio Warner for subscribers. And I am the coast mark aims here in Rochester, New York. Still licking my wounds and I'm on the line with John Dolenay, K Gary Bredger, K The Warner in Glasgow. Near Glasgow, Clyde Bank. Clyde Bank in February. They say there's nothing like it. And is there? Well, if you like how the fun went. Okay, howling went. No, thank God, Nafoggy. It's got howling wind, which when you're in a warm hotel room can be really fun. Just listening to those noises out there. It may mean nostalgic for Dunedin. And I've said before that I'd never heard howling wind outdoors while I was inside in California because there isn't that much wind. But got to Dunedin and there's actually howling wind. And the people who came to Dunedin came from here, a lot of them. So they must have thought the whole world was nothing but howling wind. We get real howling wind here. And we have those very tall kind of thin trees that really creek and sway. And sometimes fall. I mean, a tree, you know, 50, 60, 70 foot tree, whatever, you know, falling on your roof or on your cars, a real problem out here. Yeah. Well, yeah, I would kill you. I would think if you were unlucky enough to be under it. Yeah. So looking forward to our discussion today, our talk today with Ann Newman about Ethiopia. I mean, so hard to find anybody to talk to about the Ethiopian war. And she actually got there. She got inside for Harper's Magazine and we'll get to that. Before then, I don't know any follow up on the on the Hirsch interview that we did. You know, it got a lot of play. That's for sure because we got the first sort of like the. The good and the bad about getting the first exclusive on a. Giant should storm bombshell story like that is. You know, like I've read some of Hirsch's interviews since then and he's more open and more relaxed. And so there's some of the more some of the interviews could be a bit more relaxed and a bit more open. And you know, with us, I mean, you heard him even like before the show, like the first thing you yelled at is you're not going to, what did he say? He's like, you're not going to have me go over the story. Are you? You're not going to have me retell the story. So there was like, whoop, I better scratch off about half of these questions here right now because it was clear. He was like, he had his finger on the hang up button and he's just like, I can dare you. And actually, the F bombs, he didn't, I don't think he did any F bombs in the interview, but when I, well, either he didn't do them or who cared at that point. I mean, he didn't, he didn't need four letter words. It's terrifying. Yeah, in fact, when he was in the pre interview, every, you know, there were more four letter words than I'd like my kids to hear. But he was a lot friendly too. He was not as aggressive and I, you know, and I get it. I get why he was, I mean, it was, it was thrilling. I got to, you know, it was thrilling. It was, it was harrowing and it was thrilling. But I get why he did it because here he's put out this story and I can tell you, there's a lot that of stuff that we're told more in confidence that we can't talk about. But, you know, if you're wondering why even, even now it's been what, a little over a week now since the story came out and there's still nada, nothing in the elite Anglo-World press, not in New York Times, not in Washington Post, not in our state government media, you know, NPR, BBC News. I mean, the blackout on it is, it's creepy in part because you can see it, you watch the blackout happening. We all talk about it, we all know it and they're still doing it. It's pretty damn weird. But I know that. No, but it is weird because it is. Yeah, it's like they, they think they can still black it out completely without blacking out all electronic media, which was what happened in Ethiopia and the war will be talking about. But you really can't do that. And the good news that I've seen is that I've been trying to track that story since we did the interview. Well, since you did the interview, Mark, I wasn't much involved except to screech and grovel occasionally. But the blackout doesn't seem to be working because they're stages or phases of a establishment sneering. And when they think they got you contained, they say, oh, it's a sad, sad thing to watch. There was actually a story exactly like that, like in the South China Morning Post, which internationally is a big site. And the reporter was saying, don't be too hard on Seymour Hirsch, the ultimate. I've never done a story in his life says, don't be too hard on him looking down his nose. And then tablet, which is like the quasi progressive Jewish magazine, used a baseball metaphor, I think Seymour Hirsch swings and misses big. And it was all sort of poor old guy. And that's not the case anymore where you get reactions. And of course, the A level publications are not reacting at all. But where they do react, there's real anger now. They're not pretending anymore. Yeah, it's not working. It's kind of, it's interesting to watch. I mean, it's actually spreading around, coursing through the veins a lot more now than it did a week ago when there was a lot of effort initially put in to be litaling it. And a lot of that effort was all about be litaling it. A big line of argument was he relied on one anonymous source. Well, that's one thing we teased out of him. He did not rely. And we knew it anyway. But anybody who said any blue check, any osent guy who said, you know, whose line of attack was he relied on one anonymous source and didn't ask Hirsch if he only relied on just judged by a bad faith reading. You can dismiss that person for good. I mean, here's, I just, I just call up here a few of those people. You know, here's our good friend, Elliot Higgins. Seymour Hirsch's latest claims, the Nord Stream pipeline was blown up by the US can be most easily summarized by his line, quote, according to a source with direct knowledge of the operational planning, unquote. And here's Crystal Guros, they've also belling cat. I hope I won't live to become a senile as corrupt or as obsessively lying. This is a guy paid by the US government, by the way. Or as an aisle, yeah, or as obsessively lying as Seymour Hirsch. So he's both senile and obsessively lying. If you're senile, you can't even see nothing as ridiculous. He's as sharp as a straight razor. He's just lies, whose irresponsible single anonymous source reporting by a name with legacy authority is among the worst damage to journalism anyone ever caused. TLDI, total fiction. Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's, that's belling cat paid. And, you know, here's another, this is interesting, I thought, because when Hirsch put out his book on the downing of Flight 007, the target is destroyed, which he've talked about before. You know, one of the things, I mean, he goes out there and investigates every claim, including Soviet claims that that KL 007 was actually a spy plane. And he says, no, it wasn't, but they definitely genuinely believed it. And were made very paranoid by all sorts of actual spy plane incursions. And he also got, although he didn't get the full goods on it, but he was basically there, at the US manipulated what was a Soviet shoot down, but manipulated the tapes and manipulated the whole story to make it seem like they deliberately knowingly shot down a civilian airliner because they have no value of human life in the Soviet Union. And before the book got published, a couple of months before Bill Casey, the head of the CIA under Reagan, called Hirsch at his home and said, if you publish it, you can be criminally prosecuted because you'll be revealing secrets that are that can allow you to be criminally prosecuted. And he called the head of random house and threatened the same. And they published it anyway, no one was prosecuted. But it's just kind of ironic that several decades later, you have, you know, Crystal Groza of Elliot Higgins. Here's another one of these, let me see where it is here. And this is Julia Antalela, she's head of COTA's story, which is also funded by the National Endowment. So you have all these people funded by the National Endowment for Democracy, which is the brainchild of William Casey. He's a condo to the down, but that was his idea for the whole show on National Endowment. Yes. So these people are taking money for the National Endowment for Democracy and now they're out there discrediting or trying to discredit Hirsch's story. It's like, it's like, Al Davis is, you know, like it's like, Al Davis keeps poisoning everything for the Raiders. Bill Casey keeps poisoning everything just in the world, you know, even from the grave. What struck me as all this started to fracture is a story that I remembered and I wish I'd asked, well, before I was cut off, I wish I'd asked Seymour about, which seems important to me, which is Sweden and Denmark both started investigations of the pipeline blast. They both finished those investigations and then they decided not to release the results or talk about them in public. That's kind of interesting. Oh, yeah. And it seems like it could trigger some useful journalistic curiosity, but it doesn't seem to have done so. Well, even, you know, what's amazing is even the Washington Post in late December reported that the European officials tell them that there's no evidence that the Russians did it and in fact, even more European officials unnamed said they doubted Russia had anything to do with it. And that's it. That's the end of the story. Move on. Yeah. Well, there's nobody else then. It's the US or Ukraine or a lot of, I mean, when we were trying to think of other people brainstorming this, who would have been the culprit. Not many people actually thought it was the US. Most thought, Poland, like I thought, if it wasn't them, it was like Poland or the UK with sort of a US nod. But I think as you pointed out, John, not a lot of people have that capability to pull off an underwater operation. No, no, the US and the UK are marine powers. They're good at air sea combined arms operations. Russia's never been very good at that. They keep getting propped up as a coming power in that area when the US and British navies need more money, but they never quite get there. Both of, both the British and the US navies and probably some of the Scandinavian navies do have that ability and have a lot of experience. Right. By the way, one other thing I want to say, I mean, I think most people who are listening by this time are on team Hirsch with this story, but another line of smear, which is very common. You see it, especially among leftists who don't like the story, but don't want to say that they've always hated Hirsch. They want to let you know that they used to love Hirsch. It used to be great. I'd forgotten how much hate he brought on himself and how much he was sort of discredited by kind of the liberal left end of the journalism media world from his book on JFK Camelot. It's a brutal book. JFK does not come off as a pacifist hero at all. It's absolutely savage. And there are even some controversies about some of the documents or sources he relied on that people used to really try to discredit him as a journalist period. I'm just going to read like something here's Gary Willis, who's a really good writer and a big name, but he wrote in the New York Review of Books in 1999, 2000 or so, about Hirsch. He wrote, it is an astonishing spectacle of this book in his mad zeal to destroy Camelot, to raise it down, dance on the rubble, and so salt on the ground where it stood. Hirsch has with precision and method disassembled and obliterated his own career and reputation. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? Then of course it goes on to do the Abu Ghraib story. So it's like there's never been a time where people in his career said, they've always been saying he used to be good. Now he's destroyed his reputation. We no longer have to listen to him over and over and over. It's not an argument against the story that he used to be good and now he's lost it. Well the other argument against the story is even less germane as they used to say, which is this is a story that gives aid in comfort to Russia. That's not really the issue here. At the moment, a who done it, a pretty straightforward mystery, something happened who did it. With those things you're actually supposed to try to find the party who was guilty and let the chips fall where they may. You're not supposed to tailor your findings to a political agenda. I mean anything that makes America look bad is a gift to Russia. So don't do things like blow up your own allies' pipelines. The whole Iraq war made Russia look better. What can you say? The Afghanistan war, the X-Pose on those Afghan papers and what we knew, all of that was a gift to Russia because it showed how corrupt and violent it was. I think there's been a kind of mental decline in the Aselec order elite. It came out again in this horrible story about East Palestine, Ohio, this wretched appellation town that was poisoned by a derailment of a train carrying very serious chemicals and running without proper regulations. That story wasn't covered by any of the major media for a long time. When that failure to cover the story became an issue in itself, the reaction was really frightening. What do you expect? They voted for Trump and it's just a way of making us look bad. This has been especially Mayor Pete because Mayor Pete is a hero because he fought in Afghanistan. That makes you a hero. You can't say anything bad about it. It was a dismal spectacle and showed the degree to which the whole discourse has become mutual snorling. Yeah. Okay. Anyways, let's move on from that to our big story for the day, which is the war in Ethiopia that we've discussed a lot on the show that John, you've written about a lot. We have a guest who actually went to Ethiopia to report on what she saw and what she didn't see. So let's get to our interview with Ann Newman. Okay. We are really honored to have with us Ann Newman to talk about the war or wars even in Ethiopia. Ann is the author of a book The Good Death and Exploration of Dying in America. I feel like I have to read that. I'm kind of dreading it, but it's an important subject. I don't know what else you can say. Anyway, her work has also appeared in the New York Times Guardian, The Baffler, and Harper's magazine where her excellent article on Ethiopia was just published in the current issue, I believe. The article in Ethiopia, it's called Falling Like Leaves, The War in Ethiopia, and it's crimes against civilians. So first of all, welcome to the show Ann and thank you for coming on. Thank you. If you ever need any information about End of Life Care, you just give me a call. Really? Yeah. I mean, always, but everyone should buy the book, however. Yes. Yes. I mean, we're all going to be there one day. Yes indeed. Yes. And Falling Like Leaves, as comes out toward the end of the piece, is really a quote from an Ethiopian refugee that I met in Cairo, and he's talking about what it's like in his country right now. Right. So, well, that brings us, I think, to the first question. Look, we want to discuss a lot of things with the war in Ethiopia, of course, but also how you were able to get the story and right because there has been almost no reporting whatsoever from inside Ethiopia. They've managed that really well. And then, you know, and then sort of larger questions about reporting in a country where all sorts of atrocities are going on and, you know, access is limited for obvious reasons. But anyway, let's first start with how you got into this story, how you got into Ethiopia and then sort of take it from there. The story, how I ended up getting into Ethiopia is two questions, right? Like, how did I go there for the reporting? But what actually interested me in this war when there was no one talking about it around us? Right. And I think that was the first question on a US Army base outside of Asmara, Irahtria, in the 1960s before I was born. And that base is very special. And of course, at that time, Irahtria was part of Ethiopia. But that base was classified. My father never told us what he was doing, but for the most part, we know that Americans were using that Italian-built base because Irahtria had been first an Italian colony. Right. They were using that Italian-built base to spy on the Russians. And so they were listening to the moon or the space program. And then it just kind of bled into the Cold War era. And so the Americans were there ultimately until 74, although my father was not. But the Americans were pushed out. That's amazing because one of the best books on the region is my Keala, Michaela Wrong's book, I didn't do it for you. Yes. How the world used and abused a small African nation. And I think she talks about that specific base, which was inhabited sequentially by Italians then British, then Americans. Exactly. Yeah, that's the base. And she says it's still classified, but we know that this is what they were doing. Yeah. I think her book is beautiful, right? I actually was able to, we'll get to all of this, but I was able to go to Asmara and see the base in 2019 after Avi and Azeas made their piece. And I grabbed my sister and I said, we've got to go because of course our whole lives were filled with artifacts and stories that my father brought back. In many ways, he was typical of his generation. I mean, my whole family is men and I from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. It's not like we get around a lot. And so, you know, so this was a big deal. I mean, not only did he join the army, which was not something that the men and I were doing at the time, but he ended up being this specialist in Ethiopia or now Eritrea. And so I have all of his letters. And so for a while, I've been working on a book about American Empire and how it has, and it's lifespan, you know, during my lifespan. I'm about 53 or 54. And so, and so watching all of this, seeing Avi, taking my sister and going to Addis and then Asmara, and then seeing the promise of this country that I love in this white western way and that I have a relationship with in this, you know, post-colonial American Empire way. But seeing the real damage that began on November 3rd, 2020 made me want to go. And I couldn't get enough information about it. And sure enough, we know it's because Avi was so good at closing down to Gray, at stifling information in and out of the country. And so I wrote a pitch about the story that kind of covered my personal connection because I just wanted to be really straight up about it. You know, I didn't want a helicopter in and kind of write that, you know, that kind of story. And we rewrote the pitch. I pitched it to everybody. And Harper's, my beloved editor at Harper's Katie Ryder said, yeah, let's do this. And I was just about to apply for a visa. I decided to go in and a tourist visa, which just, I don't know, we can all criticize the things that we do. But it happens a lot in Russia and that area too. It's like the only way to easily more easily get in, but you can get more trouble, right? Totally. And, you know, I talked to all the experts and they were like the worst thing that will happen to you likely. Yeah. That word likely is that they'll deport you. Right. If they have a problem. They're going in a tourist visa. And then I broke my ankle. So I had a motorcycle accident and broke my ankle. And when I was walking again, I was like, I'm going because the, you know, it's just like I didn't want to wait. But then of course, this was the Tigrayans had pushed out of their territory. And we're advancing on Atazaba. I had a visa at this point. The State Department was sending me an email twice a day saying don't go because we will not get you out. Right. I don't know if any of you had any of those emails are terrifying. Yeah. And also just, yeah, just relentless. And because you had already told somebody there that you were planning on going or you were just, I applied for a tourist visa. And so I was on the list to receive the State Department emails that said don't go. So when the Tigrayans then retreated back to their borders, I grabbed my bag and I ran. And you know, I had like a little backpack. It's like we do, right? You pack late. You wear shoes that you can jog in. You like, and I didn't know what to expect. I knew that I wouldn't try to get into Tigray. The world was still going on. And I'm just not, I'm not that bang, bang. I'm just not cut out for that. I think there are other people that do it and do it well. And I ended up. Although few of them have actually gotten into Tigray, it's a big problem with this story. It's a huge problem. But I think also, like, you know, there are a lot of things that the Ethiopian government, the the Abbey administration did right with this war as far as serving their own purposes. Right? Like there are media handling, the misinformation online, all of that has been masterful. Well, and then the most effective one is always just cutting the communications, which they did on the night of the third and fourth of November when the war began. Yeah, they cut everything, cell phones, internet banking, just close the borders. So you would have been there at the end of June 2021, or at least that was the amazing TPLF recapture of, or TDF recapture of Michaela. I mean, I remember that from outside, and I was trying very hard to follow the war, as one of the most stunning surprises of my lifetime, really. That was not supposed to happen. They were supposed to be easily defeated. I wish we knew a lot more about how it had been done, because it was just militarily impressive. Yeah. No, I would have headed there in September. So it would have been after that. And I ended up not going till the spring, of course. I ended up flying mid-March of 2022. 22. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So at that point, the TDF had been pushed back into the border to Gray. So they almost advanced on Autosoblava. I remember all that and people were free. And then they got pushed back. And we'll talk about all this as well. Then they got pushed back and back and back all the way back into to Gray. Right. And that's around the time you got in. So that was right. And there was a bit of a ceasefire then, right? So I had a guide, I mean, just because the term fixer is so problematic. Basically this guy, you know, he was everything. His name is Mario and I write about him in the piece. But he's a friend of a friend who had worked on a documentary. And Mario said, let's drive to Dezi and then La La Bella. And he wanted to do like this 12-day tour. And I was like, dude, I'm not equipped for that. I want an armed guard if I'm like, some of these areas are still hot. It's like, and he was like, well, let's go to La La Bella. Because his brother was there, his whole family's there. La La Bella had been occupied by the TPLF for about five months. And they had been gone for about three months by the time we got there. And so think of the conundrum that I was in. I was like, we know where the majority of the violence in this war has been taken place. It's within to gray. Undoubtedly it has been the sight of the war all this time. But the only people I'm going to get to talk to are Amhara or Pro-Abhi government. And Amhara have been occupied by a vengeful TPLF or TDF. And who are going to be in our... This is the beauty of Abhi's management of communications, as you said. It was well done. I was effective. So what I did was try to pre-game the reporting. I mean, first of all, I was afraid I'd get to Ethiopia and I wouldn't be able to leave the capital. Or I wouldn't be able to find anyone to talk to me because to Graham's had been detained all across the state. And so I stopped in Cairo where I have some family friends. And it's a place that I return to all the time. It's just like my entryway to the continent all the time. And I said to myself, I'm just going to go find the Ethiopian restaurants because we know there's an enormous Ethiopian and Eritrean refugee population in Cairo. And if I can talk to people there, whether it was displaced to Gryons or whatever, well, as you know from the piece, I find a lot of... Ethiopians and Eritreans, but their relationship to the war, they weren't to Graham. And I couldn't find any to Graham's there. No, I think the to Graham's were laying low at the time. Exactly. They were being pogromed in Atas Ababa. But why wouldn't there be so many to Graham's? I mean, I don't know much about the different diaspora communities. Like John, I know you saw like anything in Toronto, right? Or to Graham diaspora community kind of trying to protest. Yeah. But some of it's just numbers, right? To Graham's make up 6% of the population. So there's a small number of a very large nation of like over 110 million. So there's that. But I think also, you know, I think the war was a flash. It was like, there was a lot of saber rattling, but I don't think anyone could have imagined this. In many ways, Abbi's Western favor, the Nobel Peace Prize, all of that, masked his, his, you know, the real relationship they'd had with his ex, Africa and in Eritrea. You had to wonder, was there a secret clause in the treaty like we're going to do a sandwich on Tigray because it sure looked like that. I just don't know how there couldn't be because of the way things went down. It's so gruesome to think that the very thing that he was given the Nobel Prize for had a secret basically genocide clause in it. You know, it's just, it's really dark. I would give that to Zeya Safuerka. I mean, he's a ruthless man. It's, you know, I could, we could go on about this later, but it was a hell of a thing to be in, in Eritrea after, you know, in 2019. I was wondering, was it hard to get in? No, that was that glory period where everyone was flying back to see their family relatives. So my sister and I were on this plane, like the only white women in Eritrea at the time unless, you know, it was like a handful of aid workers or something. And we had to register to go everywhere. No one would talk to us because they just, we were so obvious. And yeah, you can really see how the country is declined. But that's another story. And I really do believe that, that, that this war after peace was signed was inevitable. And, and Afarki has come out of it really strongly ahead. I mean, Abbi and his faction have paid a big price to Gray has paid a horrible price. It'll take a while to find out how horrible. But Eritrea, it had very little to lose. It was isolated anyway. Borders haven't even been broached. No, and we're, we're back strangely at this place where our conversation started. You know, that period of time where Western nations or other nations were fighting for African satellites, you know, it's a, it's a very strange thing that's taking place in the horn now. It's like an odd, I was going to say regression, but that's not true. It's, it's really a realignment. You know, you see all the surveys of African presidents or people who are asked about their feeling about Russia or China or the United States right now. And, you know, pan-Africanism, which was very much a theme of this war is, it's not doing much for the United States influence on the continent. Right. That's interesting. So, let's get back to the story. So you, you would, I mean, this is really impressive, I gotta say, just as a journalist that you were able to find, this is where you found your guide or fixer, right, was by talking to people in the, in the restaurants. So, a guide that I had in Cairo, yes. Oh, okay. He's just like this young guy. He wasn't that great and interpreter. So I ended up audio recording everything. And then, you know, I had an interpreter translate everything for me, even though he was doing translation. And that was amazing. I found an individual who had been present in my cadre, which was one of the initial massacres in Western Tigray. And I know that John has talked quite a bit about the importance of Western Tigray and its significance in the war. And even the state of, you know, that, the peace deal doesn't address where that territory is going to go quite specifically enough for, for people to, to be comfortable. But so, so then the fixer that I did find for Ethiopia was a friend of a friend that, I have in Brooklyn. And so he and I had a lot of communication before I got there. We met in, in artists once I arrived. And then, you know, within two days, we flew to La La Bella. And the airports were just open. I think I was one of a handful of people who had been there, you know, outsiders tourists who had been to the city. It's really a town, like a small city. And just to tell you about La La Bella, it's this UNESCO World Heritage site in the 12th and 13th centuries, King La La Bella. And we can presume a host of workers carved these incredible churches out of solid stone. And many of them are below grade, below the ground. But they're just stunning. And of course, I was there during Lent. And I was deeply moved to be in this place without other tourists, you know, usually it's thronged with people coming to see. But a lot of people who live there saw me and were so thankful that their livelihood, tourism, was coming back. Right. Right. So the city lived, and we should tell listeners also where La La Bella is located because it's pretty close to the Tigrayan border, isn't it? Yeah. Like Raya, the other contested area that along with Western Tigray is north east of La La Bella. It's a two hour flight north of Otis. Yeah. And, you know, probably after oxen, probably the holiest city in the country. And, you know, quite rural, but very Western, you know, very tourist-facing. And so you mentioned in this story that the TPLF or TDF troops might have been merciful because of the many historic churches in the area. And that raises a really interesting question about the place of religion and all this. It's sort of a... I mean, one of the things about Abbey is he's Pentecostal. And that's a very powerful rising demographic in a lot of sort of mid-income countries right now, although Ethiopia doesn't really qualify as mid-income. But aspirational countries, let's say. And the Tigrayans are very much Ethiopian Orthodox, and they would have valued this. Were there a lot of Pentecostals or is La La Bella still pretty Orthodox? La La Bella is definitely very Orthodox. But I think the nice thing or the fascinating thing, right? Why Pentecostalism spreads the way it does is that it's very some credit with, you know, established religion there. And it works very well with Ethiopian church. And so Abbey can use all of this aspirational language and, you know, unity, talk, and, you know, bootstraps type conversation. And that's his faith. And it works very well with individuals who believe that Ethiopia should go at a loan, can rise on its own. And I mean, we can qualify all of that language as well. They still want American aid and other things. But they don't want meddling in inter-oval policy. And internal policy at the moment is pretty, pretty grotesque. Pretty brutal. Yeah. Pretty brutal. Yeah. So I do think that religion, and we can get to that in a bit, right? There's a schism in the church at the moment. This is the, you know, the other war in Ethiopia in Aromia, where some Aromal Abuna, or, I guess, they're like the equivalent of bishops in the Ethiopian Orthodox church, have within the past two or three weeks declared independence and broken away from the primary church. And I just saw video, like within the past couple of days, of Abi hugging, you know, the Abuna of the Ethiopian Orthodox church, basically signifying his support for them. For the ones who have withdrawn from the Congress overall? No, no. For the ones who stayed. Yeah. Ones who stayed. Okay. The mother church. Yeah. It's intertwined with the state, essentially, right? And I presume then that this is part, I mean, you see this in some wars or developing wars. Like in Ukraine, also, there's been a lot of schisming going on since 2014 that has a lot to do with separating from the bigger, long time brother ruler, whatever you call it. And I think about Aromio, it's tied in with Aromian independence as well or, yeah. Absolutely. The Abuna are saying are people want to worship in their own language? Yeah. You know, they want, they want the autonomy to worship the way they wish. And you know, Aromia is, it's incredibly deadly. Oh, that's, that's, that's, that's amazing. That's, so no more gays. We want to worship in the Aroma language. Like very, very odd Lutheran and Baptist echoes throughout all this. Yeah, yeah. It's like a Vatican too, right? So that's taking place in this, in this moment. So if we want to talk about religion and Ethiopia. And yeah, I think Russian history is a great teacher. The United States history is a great teacher of the power of faith in propelling leaders to power. When you were in Lalibella, you met Fano. And can you explain Fano and then talk about meeting them? Yeah, Fano are a militia group that is Amhara based. They believe in, they believe deeply in Amhara oppression and are very much compelled to take up arms to restore their historic. They believe historic and rightful place as rulers of the country. So and I've heard you talk about this in the past. Ethiopia has the Somhara history that is, you know, highly salassy, brought it into modern times sort of. And it has to do with the story of Ethiopia and it's founding rulers as descendants of King Solomon. And it's a compelling story. You know, there's footage of US senators talking about this on the floor of the Senate chamber. It's not truth. There's very little to prove that it took place, but we know the power of story. And it is deeply compelling in the Somhara nationalism that that we've seen rise up and, you know, the Fano have swelled in numbers since the beginning of this war. I think they must have known what was coming at the start like November 3rd or 4th. They gushed into Western Tigray according to Amnesty International and other organizations according to interviews that they've done with refugees. The Fano are implicated and some of the more gruesome killing that took place or atrocities, that took place, the rapes. It's just a war that's characterized by horrifying systematic rape and sexual abuse and violence. And the Fano, along with Eritreans, were right there. And it was, you know, because La La Bella had been held for five months, because the Amhara are deeply paranoid and feel that what they've got everyone else wants. So Fano have started training in La La Bella. They don't want the, you know, the TDF to come back. And there were 200. We met a guy in a cafe, someone that Mario had known over a period of time. And he offered to take us to this Fano training. And so the next thing I know, I'm on a field at sunset with about 200 individuals of all ages, mostly men, but also some women. And they're learning how to assemble and disassemble Kalishnikov rifles in the field. And there's this one picture that I took that was just stunning. It's the trainers have laid out mats on the ground. And you know, the trainers down on his knee showing everyone how to do this. And one of the trainers is hovering over a USAID food bag with his Kalishnikov rifle showing these towns people how to become soldiers. It was just a stunning experience. You know, I have another, you know, the guys were handing around a hand grenade and, you know, telling me how to use it. This is how the serrated pieces come apart when it is live and thrown. You know, that sort of thing. It was just, I think I think I would have been scared if I hadn't been so fascinated. It was just stunning to see this. Scared later, right? When you think about it, you're like, wait a minute. What was I doing? You know, my guy back in New York, I just didn't tell him about it. But it was, it did a couple of things for me. It made me realize how these men and women were just ordinary people, compelled by a narrative and a sense of safety, you know, when the TDF came back, they were in Lala Bella for a number of months and then pushed out and then came back again with vengeance. And you know, the people in Lala Bella did not want to experience that again. But it also taught me that reporting is reporting, right? Like, that's something that I think a lot of people who haven't had this experience. You know, I can report the story, any kind of story, but I didn't know that I could report that kind of story. What do you mean? Well, I mean, like, I was just there with my notepad and a recorder asking questions. And that felt very doable to me in the moment. I did not feel unsafe. And because I knew, because I knew what had been taking place in the war, I knew what questions to ask. It was just, it reassured me that I was on the right track with the piece. And that's like a little sausage-making comment. Yeah. No, I think the sausage-making is the most important thing here in some ways. I think it's crucial because I mean, at the back of your mind, there must have been the sense at the same time. Like, you know, I guess there's definite suffering here. But, you know, what is the suffering in ground zero? Like, you know, in provincial T-Grey, because that's been effectively cut off from you. Right. Right. So that's what the piece had to be. Right. It had to be what I could access. Which is getting more word. And then I just, what I could report. Yeah. And the data had to, if it was this bad here. Yeah. What was it like in T-Grey, where everything is hidden, where the soldier to civilian population is completely different, where soldiers were free to do what they wanted without... Yeah, especially our tree and soldiers. I mean, the our, the our trends were not under the very slight restraints that confronted the Ethiopian forces because... Right. Really, I've worked, I had nothing to lose here. Absolutely. ...going for, he was going for a human rights champion of the year anytime soon. Well, and every actually incentive to do as much damage as he could while he still had the opportunity, right? So it was like how much damage could he get in before maybe his deal with Abbey was no longer in service. Right. Yeah. And I mean, the amount of damage they could do, there was no aid going in or out, no medicine going in or out. Just no one. It's stunning to me that we still aren't talking about it. Yeah. Now, I think people don't understand how wartime famines, artificial famines, kill so much faster than guns. They destroyed children first, the ones that you don't kill, they damage. And when you haven't completely landlocked very poor province like DeGrey, you can kill a lot of people fast. And so we don't know the numbers. And I just have this feeling the numbers are going to be terrifying when they come back. I think you're right, John. What numbers do you have? John Nyson against has done the most extensive reporting on this. And he's saying as many as 800,000. And that's just civilians. That's insane. Every time, every time, you know, I'm talking to other groups or, you know, someone interviews me about this story. And they're saying thousands dead. And I'm like, no, no, this is not thousands. This is hundreds of thousands. And then they're saying, yes, but not just civilians. And I'm like, no, we're just talking about civilians only. Oh, yeah. The point of this kind of war is not to have big battles on the Gettigsburg-Stalingrad model. The point is to avoid them and to kill as many civilians as you can. That raises a question that I know you've talked about before, which is why don't the world media seem more interested in this? I think the first one on the table is just racism, right? It's an African continent. They don't value their people. Like death is something different there than it is here. And that's just pure racism. And secondly, we're accustomed to the Horn of Africa being a tumultuous and deadly place. You know, I grew up in the 80s where, you know, the Derg famine was really the only thing I knew about Ethiopia besides my father's stories or as a population. That's the only thing we knew. So we have this sense that that's just what, that's how people live there. Black, down, you know, is another. Totally. Yeah. And I mean, Somalia has been a mess for a long time. Sudan has a, you know, a coup and it's just we're accustomed to those stories. But we forget that these are individuals living through this horrifying history. And you know, we have a lot to do with it. Yeah. However we want to think of ourselves as a world power, we have a responsibility. Or at least we have a relationship with these countries. And, and this is happening as, you know, maybe the Ethiopian government is saying we don't want American intervention. We're not your puppet. There's a lot of that sentiment and certainly Abbey carries that well. But still, I mean, Western powers send a lot of aid to this country to just let this go on is horrifying. That raises a question. I mean, what is the US? I mean, let's be honest, the West is US led. What is their attitude towards this? Because there are some instances in the world, which, you know, maybe they're not considered, they're not white, where the US and the West does take an interest in the victims. And there are others where they sort of, they don't take that much of an interest or they kind of do the bare minimum to appear as if they're trying to do something. I mean, I don't correct me if I'm wrong, but from what you've seen. But it just, it seems to me that, you know, that there's a lot of concern from Washington and maybe a few other Western capitals and they want this to stop. But they don't want to undermine their relationship with Abbey and Ethiopia, which has been an old, important relationship with Abbey. And in the sort of the war on terror, like that goes back several years or a couple of decades, even. Is that right? Yeah, you're right, Mark. Like, even during TPLF dominance of the EPRDF, the prior party, 27 years, they were not peaceful years. We know that there were, there were revolts and riots and the United States for the sake I believe of, you know, maintaining peace, maintaining a relationship in the horn. You know, the United States interest in Ethiopia has always been strategic. Yes. You know, it goes back to Kagnus Station. That's the lesson of all of this. Yeah, that was where I'm, I'm Mick Hela. Sorry, but that's where Mick Hela wrong got the title for her book. Like, I didn't do it for you. That was originally spoken by a British soldier being cheered by Aaritrians after defeating the Italian fascist troops and he sneers at the Aaritrians. I didn't do it for you. Exactly, right? Yeah, that's a, that's a beautiful book. If anyone, if anyone's looking for something to read about the horn, it's a very gorgeous book. She's just a beautiful writer. But no, I mean, then Nick Terst has done some really fantastic reporting at the intercept about, you know, in the snowden papers, we find that Stonehouse where my father had been, had been working, you know, was a prime site for spying on the Russians and the NSA over years has helped build a spine network throughout Ethiopia, like our, our CIA, our NSA have, have deep surveillance, intel infrastructure in the country. And, you know, they don't want to rock that. They don't want to rock that. But also, you know, also this is a Christian country, you know, as far as the West is concerned, there are no Muslims in Ethiopia, but there indeed are. But this is a Christian country in the horn of Africa. And I think the United States for a long time really thought that it could work with that Christian country, which is also rife with racism, right? That's the understanding of this country. So all of this, I think every, Abbi got away with a lot. And at the very beginning, when the war began, there were officials that were throwing around the G word, right? The genocide word. And I think the diaspora really shut that down. So the diaspora, all of the United States. The Ethiopian diaspora, the non-tagrain Ethiopian diaspora is what you're saying. Exactly. The non-tagrain Ethiopian diaspora staged demonstrations in DC and every other major city, but also around the world. And I went to one in 2020, in the fall of 2020, in Washington, DC, and it was stunning. It was enormous. Everyone was very angry. There are multiple organizations around the world that organize and motivate the diaspora and again, we know this is a big diaspora of people who left. And it's very active online as well. Yes. I think it was a little more of an even match online because there are a lot of highly online to grains. But I also think that Abbi's administration is seeding a lot of this misinformation as well. But yes, absolutely diaspora is very busy and very active. So they were demonstrating outside the State Department. And very quickly, we saw officials retreat from that genocide word. That's interesting. I mean, I don't mean to pick any fights, but there has been even a sort of a part of the left. We had a little friendly, I guess, spat with him, whatever about this. There was a part of the Western left that had this idea and it was clearly came out of the non-tagrained diaspora and the Abbi people. What Tegre was doing was actually some kind of U.S.-backed regime change operation, which has seemed absolutely preposterous because I think Terce wrote about this in the first six months of the war before the TDF retook McKellah and all this massacres were going on. At Voice of America, for example, people who wanted to write about atrocities there or talk about atrocities couldn't even get their articles out or their segments posted. And there was a revolt within it eventually because everything was so obviously skewed towards the Abbi government. And it was only after the TDF storm that took McKellah that it seemed like you started hearing and more official organs like, oh, something really bad went on there when we weren't talking about it. Exactly. Yeah. And that was Terce. I saw that piece as well. But also, the Pulitzer Center made it possible for me to go do this reporting. And what I did was buddy up this piece for Harper's with another that will come out soon at the Baffler. And the second piece, kind of the companion piece, is on how the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, this project that was begun under the TPLF, but has Abbi's really kicked it into gear. It's enormous dam. It'll be the largest on the continent. And it is upstream. So 80% of the Niles water comes from Ethiopia. And Sudan and then Egypt are downstream. The Nile flows from south to north. And the dam has caused really tense relations with both Sudan and Egypt, but particularly Egypt, which defines itself by the Nile, something like 85% of its population lives within a mile of the Nile. And the Trump administration really fucked up the negotiations over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. And so Abbi was able to use this enormous project and just cloud it in promises that may or may not ever come to fruition. The promises for electrifying the country and selling the excess to neighbors and all of this. And also like we Ethiopians will do this together. He's used that as another way to unify the country. And I think because the United States had bungled, like Trump, you know, how did he bungle it? He said publicly, you know, the Egyptians could bomb this thing. Yes. Exactly. But it wasn't just the everyday bungle. It was really on LCC's behalf. He threatened bombing the dam. It's so bad. And so I think like we just lost so much credibility throughout that, you know, lost more credibility. And I mean, that wasn't even it. I think there were other things that the Trump administration had done. They just couldn't get Egypt to come in on it. So yeah, your point is like that also that just the US was even less inclined to rock the boat after all these problems, these, you know, shits, storms that were created by Trump. Or just less credible, right? Less credible, right? Less credible. Like you have no right to interfere in our internal operations. You know, I'll be keeps calling it. Do you remember the phrase John? All the media stories said this, a policing operation or something security. I think it was a minimizing term that he was using. And indeed, that's not what it has been, but that was enough cover where, you know, we just don't have credibility the way that the United States used to. Yeah. And in practical terms, things change when you're inland and high altitude. Tigray is an easy place to choke because it's inland high altitude. That's unlucky if you're a modern era country. You know, you can be very easily isolated. You can't raise much food and you can easily be strangled. Well, nobody wants the United States soldiers in the horn of Africa. I mean, there's just, that's just never going to happen. And so I think for the sake of keeping relations with Ethiopia, the government, the US administration has always looked at scams at human rights violations and wars of this sort. And what do you think of the African Union's role in the recent peace deal? Because one thing that struck me was that the Nigerian official who handled it, I forget his name. I'm not surprised. It's like there's no such thing as a no-fault divorce in this peace deal making. But no, I mean, the world, everyone around the world said if the African Union goes ahead with Obasano who has a relationship with Abbey, how's that going to work out for Tigray? And it's worked out the way that we see, right? Indeed, after I left, after the second wave of the war, it was just so apparent that this was like wave warfare, just bodies thrown into the gaping maw of brutal warfare. So much death took place in that second wave. And like something had to be done, Tigray just didn't have the resources to carry on like that. And I think they had just run out their resources to the point where it needed to stop. Right. And they were willing to accept whatever they had to. And in that first negotiation, I get them reverse. Was the first in South Africa, right? Or was it in Nairobi? That's okay. Because there were two. The first, and forgive me for mixing them up. But the first really was very anti-Tigray. They had a hard time deciding whether it was the TPLF or the TDF or just Tigray administration who was signing the document even. But it didn't mention any of the big points that are at issue in this war. It didn't address Western Tigray. It didn't address irritatory and troops, at least not directly. It said something like foreign powers. It didn't really address the fauna. And I'm Hara services. I'm Hara special forces that are also in Western Tigray and Reya. And so it was just deeply all it did was stop the violence, which was enough, I guess. It was enough. I mean, yeah, Tigray is uniquely vulnerable. Total population, 7 million, probably a lot less now. Inland, landlocked, remote. It can actually be extirpated. I mean, genocide is a term used very often. But in the most literal sense, it could be done. So you got to make a deal. Yes. And they did. And you're right, that violence had to stop. And my point would be that Western powers were not involved, except I think United States was kind of hovering over these deals. But I'll be refused to allow anyone but the African Union. And this is part of his thing, right? Like pan-Africanism, we're here to take care of ourselves. We make our own decisions down with colonialism, post-colonialism, Western influence. And so he had the power to stick with that. That's a good point. Yeah. This is highly unprofessional of me. But I should, you know, just anyway, for some listeners who aren't, when we have talked about this war a lot since it first started. But it's still good to kind of hang on to. If you could even give a brief timeline of the war and sort of how it broke out in November 2020, and then a couple of the waves. I mean, even just kind of the big bullet points of the war. Yeah. And John, help me out here. But like way in wherever you want. But I think there had been a lot of tension after Abbey came to power. And that was in 2018. Because he's not Tigrayan. Because he's, what is he? Amaran and Aromial, right? Well, Amara, all-Oromo mixed. But I think at that point, it looked really good. I mean, Melis and Aoi was the Tigrayan strong man who ran Ethiopia for most of the early 21st century. He was kind of a political genius. I mean, he came out of, there's a great book that I've mentioned before called War and Negari about the genesis of the student revolutionary movements. And there's a scene there where Melis and Aoi, who's nobody at the time, takes his Tigrayan fellows out of the drink-soughten university discussions in Ades Ababa in the 1970s and said, we're going to the people. And he found this Maoist movement that really kind of works and did a big share in fighting the Durg at that time, Eritrea and Tigray led Ethiopian elite were comrades in every sense. So Melis and Aoi and Aoi knew each other in these years and worked together to overthrow the Ethiopian government, which was run by highly salacious until 74. So these student movements were incredibly organized and Melis and Aoi as both came out as leaders. And Eritrea wanted its independence and got it in 91 Ethiopia. Well, I don't want to jump too far ahead. But the Durg took advantage of the student movement and uprising and overthrow of highly salacious in 74 and then ruled for a number of years. And the Durg were finally overthrown by Melis and Isaiah. And Ethiopia was relieved of communist and authoritarian, like very bad governance. And Eritrea got its independence. And the two carried on for quite a while as friends, but then border skirmish turned into a hideous war in Badmah in roughly, what was that 20 2000? Oh, around the millennium. That's all I remember, 2000, 2001. Yes, that's right, because I was in Ethiopia in 2007 for the millennium. So that's exactly right. I wanted to go to Eritrea then and everybody was like, don't even try it. So that was the start of a rank-loving relationship between these two former colleagues, comrades. And it just got worse after that. The TPLF was the dominant force in the EPRDF, which was coalition of various groups. The TPLF established Ethiopia. The TPLF is to grain, I'm sorry, just for listening to it. Yes, thank you. I'm sorry. People's liberation front. Yes. And they established Ethiopia as a federation of states. And they roughly used language to establish those borders. They said that they were going to allow individual groups to govern themselves autonomously, but that never really came to fruition in most places. And they became increasingly authoritarian. So now we died, Melis and now we died in 2012. And hallemarium desaline was promoted. And his tenure was basically just riddled with riots all over the country. The government was deeply oppressive. Media freedom was scant. And he stepped down. At this point, it looked like a very corrupt regime had been overthrown. Things were looking good. There were a lot of political prisoners. They were freed by Abbi. Yes. And wins the Nobel Prize. And then by November, early November 2020, the war begins in Tigray. And there's a lot of resentment that had been building throughout the TPLF domination. I mean, the way that Tigrayans would have seen it is like, look, we can't help it if we're more dynamic than everybody else. But at the same time, that is going to create resentment. And it did. In fact, as you mentioned, it may have created resentment in Abbi himself, who had to be like the non-Tigrayan, mostly Tigrayan elite throughout those years, and harbored a lot of soul and resentment for it. Well, he was doing communications in the military, right? And I think that he was just super savvy in painting the TPLF as the country's default downfall. Like everything that was wrong with Ethiopia was because of the TPLF. And Abbi has consistently hammered that point. So every problem in Ethiopia is from the TPLF, that prior 27 years of administration. And so as soon as anything was wrong, he could blame them. And leading up to the start of the war, sure enough, the TPLF, which was accustomed to power and autonomy, retreated to its territory and didn't want to cooperate with the new government. They held elections even after Abbi delayed them for the pandemic and claimed legitimate leadership over Tigray. And Abbi was consistent in saying this was an illegitimate election. And there were other small, saber rattling points on both sides. And I think it just built up the rhetoric, the fighting, the hopes for autonomous governance into gray. And I think the two gray and troops said at this point admitted that they preemptively started the war by attacking a federal garrison, but will never be in the war. In Mekkela. They claimed they knew the war was coming and they did a preemptive strike, but at any rate they did. They struck a government basis in Mekkela. And there's so much, I mean, we could never get into it in this very limited time. But I mean, in a sense, Ethiopia has been an imperial state and a centrifugal imperial state for a long time. And before that, it was not an imperial state. It was a collection of different cultures which were jockeying for power. And power has tended to move south from Tigray to Amhara and now toward Oromo. And it's very much like a kind of San Andreas fault. That's going to cause real trouble. And all this was probably inevitable. But it came in the timeline of the TPLF and the election of Abbi. And behind all this, it's a very, you know, in a very soren-like way is Af-working, up North saying, I can use this. Yes. And you know, I did another podcast recently and the individual kept asking me, but what are they fighting about? And I wanted to say, you know, we all fight about power. This is what countries do. And the horn is strategically very important. People want to live lives. They want to have free speech. They want to have good governance. They want to have infrastructure. And I felt silly saying those things. Wow. That's actually not everybody does fight about. I mean, there are rural counties trying to secede from California for dog's sake. Yeah. Maybe I should stop by some of them on my way out. Yeah. Exactly true. But I think some of it is, you know, that we don't have good reporting here. Nobody knows this history or how deeply involved the United States is. We don't, you know, we just, we aren't kept abreast of what's happening there. And so we don't understand the significance, whether it's in the number of deaths or the number of lives affected or the number of children who simply cannot go to school. Like, we just don't have that humanizing understanding. Do you think there's a chance that, you know, a more complete account of what happened into gray will come out? Or do you think it'll be, you know, sort of more Rwanda like or something? Or do you think it'll be maybe more like Yemen where our press and sort of official agencies said for the first five years of Saudi Arabia, the Gulf Coalition, US backed, you know, war on Yemen, they said 10,000 dead like, you know, month after month, year after year, 10,000 dead. And then sort of at some point when the I would people kind of took their eye off the ball, it's like, yeah, actually, it might have been half a million dead, but anyway, let's move around. A lot of zeros after it. We know that. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, that's a hard thing to speculate, but I don't think there will be peace and clear understanding of where this country stands until it does come out. Right. I was going to ask you if you'd seen any hints that media will be allowed into to gray anytime soon. No. In fact, last week, I just saw another reporter, an Ethiopian reporter was arrested in to gray. So that effort to keep it quiet is still going on. I don't think they can do it forever. But I do think that I think we'll get a fuller picture over time. But I mean, we don't know what Abbi's future is either. I think he's very popular. He is. He's very ruthless without looking like it. Right. And we don't know. It's a great skill. And we don't know what his relationship with Isaiah says. Right. What's their future going to look like? And if their purpose was to crush the TPLF, they've done so in part. They've crushed the Tigrayan people. But we know those leaders are still around. And I don't want to say that there's more war in the future. But I just don't know how you bring a nation back from this kind of horrifying polarization and division and inhumane treatment without pointing it out, without doing an accounting of what damage has been done. Yeah. I think your article, falling like leaves, good account of how much suffering and resentment is felt by a population which was maybe only in the sort of outer red zones of the H-MOM blast. Right. When you imagine what must be going on at ground zero, it's pretty appalling to think about. Thank you, John. It's a fantastic story. And what you describe what John is alluding to is atrocities committed by the Tigrayans as they sort of swept in and swept out of this Amara region of the vengeful Tigrayans moving in and out. Right. An idea of what might have been going on inside Tigray. I'm hoping that's how it works. That was what I wanted. But I also wanted to say this is Abbi's war. Right. Wherever these atrocities exist, we can still look back at his mismanagement of things or his nefarious purpose. And that should all rest with him. I'm sure he kind of somewhat answering this, but it seems like by unleashing this war, this full scale, you know, atrocity-laden war that is extremely bitter and targeting civilians and is really riled up ethnic divisions in a country of 110 million with all kinds of ethnic divides. But it seems like Abbi has put at risk the future of the Ethiopian state that it seems like it's falling apart. I mean, you just described how there's a schism and open schism now by the leading bishops, aroma bishops. Does it look like the state itself might go sort of Yugoslavia? I mean, if it does, it's like Yugoslavia times 10 or more. Right. And that's not the first comparison to Yugoslavia I've heard. But I do think that the lesson here is, you know, without the top heavy history of the TPLF governing the country. I think the lesson here to all of these nation states that want their own independence, I'm sorry, regional states that want their own independence from Ethiopia is that we can crush you. Right. Yeah. And we're looking at the Southern states, Saddamah, who is moving toward, like the constitution as written by the TPLF as still in effect guarantees an unprecedented amount of independence to these states. And you know, when I talked to Bahanu Nega, who's the minister of education, who is, you know, formed JinBot 7, an anti-TPLF militia group, you know, like he's an interesting, he was a Rutgers professor for a while. He's a fascinating character. But he said, oh no, we have a commission that is re-examining the constitution. We're going to rewrite it. And indeed, everyone you talk to says this constitution is the cause of the war, not Abbey, not, you know, a hyperactive TPLF that wants their independence. They're blaming the constitution. And I think now we're going to see the current administration move on those changes. And then what does that mean for all of these independence groups, you know, the OLA, because the Oromo are the most numerous group in Ethiopia. Traditionally, they've only been exhilarates partners in power. And it was the Habesha who really ran things. But that won't gloss forever. No. And the way that Abbey has treated the Oromo has not been good. Like sending in troops, you know, there was a very famous singer who was killed before the start of the war. He's mishandling it in every way because he's just not that skilled with keeping the peace, you know, he can talk unity, but he doesn't have the power or reach to do it to keep it. I think that's a very good distinction about Abbey. He's very good at managing the spin. Yes. But the events that he has to spin are not very brilliantly planned. Right. Right. So I think that's the future of the country, right? Like how does he negotiate this federation? Does it mean change the constitution? Is he going to move in a more authoritarian direction? Well, of course he is. He's already done that. You know, that's his inclination. He, you know, he thinks he's appointed by God. Yes. Like, he's got some problems as a ruler. His mother told him. His mother told him. Yeah. So he's not necessarily working toward democracy despite all of the rhetoric. Right. And I think that's a huge problem. Yeah. Yeah. And now he's got a lot of people sort of who've bloodied their hands to, I mean, he's got a lot of people sort of invested in going down with the Abbey ship or keeping it going for their own sake as well. I would imagine right? So much blood has been spilled. Right. So yeah. Right. Yeah. Anyway, this is a story that we're going to all keep our eyes on. And it's really heartbreaking among other things. And yeah, really is because it's such an amazing population. The whole Ethiopia had, it was zooming. They were really exciting people. It's too bad. Well, it's also an ancient culture. I just want to say, Mario, who I write about, who was my guide when I was there, we are in regular contact via WhatsApp. But after I left the country, he was quiet for a number of weeks. And I tried everything to get in touch with him and his family. And finally, he let me know that he had been detained by the Aroma. He's Amhara. He lived in the outskirts of Atas in Aroma territory because, of course, Aroma surrounds Atas Ababa. So he lived in one of these new houses that the state built. We don't know if he was seen with me. And that's why he was detained or what was taking place. But when he got out after six weeks of detention, he and his girlfriend, Dinette, decided that he would leave the country. And he bought a ticket to Europe. And his first stop was in Italy. And he had less than $100 on him. And so he is now in a refugee camp outside of Rome in Italy. And I'm writing a letter saying, this man's life is in danger. You can't send him back to his country. And so talk about the sausage making. That's a whole code to this piece that's incredibly powerful. I'm going to, you know, he has a hearing in March. If they're allowing visitors, I'm going to go and see if I can just, I don't know, wave my white ass around and get him some attention or safety. But I think this is a huge part of the story, right? Not only is it difficult to go to this country and do this kind of reporting from the outside, but it's dangerous if not to the reporter but to others. We know this from Afghanistan and elsewhere. But that's a sign that the country is also not doing well. Right. Yeah. And also, I just want to add, if I know we have listeners and subscribers even in Italy, if anybody thinks they can do any in any way could help Mario. Oh, thank you. Yeah. Just like send us a note or something and we'll pass it on. Yeah, we may be back in Italy by then. We'll see. Incredible. Well, let me know. Maybe I can meet up with some people. He doesn't have any cold clothes. He's never been out of the country. Oh, man. He's magnificent with languages. So he's taking Italian classes. But you know, it's still Italy's not the best country for refugees either. God, they have an actual fascist in power right now. Exactly. God. Italy's been pretty decent too. A lot of, I mean, they've formed the brunt. The people, but the political system at the moment. Like there's a difference between. Yeah, the people would be the first to tell you that. Yeah. Yeah. But nonetheless, he's not home. He's apart from his girlfriend and his family and his family rely on him for income and he's not providing that right now. So yeah. I mean, that's a heartbreak on top of heartbreak. Yeah. God, that's horrifying. All right. Well, anyway, I mean, this is a grim story. So it's not like we should end on any sort of happy note. I think that's appropriately grim and sad way to end the conversation. But I really want to thank you and Newman for spending a lot of time actually talking to us, talking with us about what you saw and your whole history there. It's really fascinating like your personal family background and everything and all of that. It's an amazing story. I have a feeling you're going to be writing a lot more about this that there are a lot more stories. Yeah. If I can get this book off the ground, thank you. Yeah. But also, it's been a real pleasure. I mean, this story can't go anywhere on social media because there are people suing Facebook for inciting violence, suing Facebook in meta. Wow. This story is not going anywhere on Facebook. And Twitter, I think, has, you know, Twitter's seen the chaos of this war and the misinformation. And it doesn't go anywhere on Twitter either. So that's terrible. That's terrible. The fact that you had me on means a lot to me and also. I'm a little blasted out. I mean, I'm a little blasted to me out. Yeah. But you're just, you're so smart and knowledgeable about it as well as it's been a pleasure. Thanks. Thank you very much. Well, really enjoyed it. Thank you again to Ann Newman. I will be posting links to the story and as well as to your book. And we look forward to reading more from you and hopefully to have you on again. Thank you, gentlemen. Have a beautiful day. Thank you. Thank you, too. Bye-bye. Okay. That was our interview with Ann Newman and we'll post links again to her article in Harper's falling like leaves, the war in Ethiopia and its crimes against civilians. I mean, as she said, the big takeaway that, you know, this war is Abby's war. That's a really, I mean, that just, if you had to just sum it up, that's it. You know, she was able to see the crimes against the Amara. But it's really, it's, it's Abby's war and the crimes are going to be worse. Yeah, closer to ground zero, which is the province of Tigray. Yeah. So we're not done with the crimes either. It's pretty damn clear. I mean, we're going to have a lot more of this. But any of what a great guest. I mean, it was so pleasant. It was so nice talking to her. I can't tell you. I mean, I have to know. I know. It's like, you know, going from the working class Chicago, you, you've read reporter, right? His memoir. It's a great memoir, by the way, not because he mentions me, but no, but going from that to this really just pleasant, intelligent and just very personal, nice, not intimidating, but smart and intelligent and not after like trying to rip my throat out. One in eight, yay, man in eight. I'm like, I'm all from that in eights now. Anyway, thank you, Anne. For being nice. Thanks, Anne. We appreciate it. Anyway, John, you said you had one quick story you wanted to tell too. It's just too good to pass up. So I'll do it quickly. Yeah. An F-22, shot down at great expense. Yes. A threatening balloon over the Yukon with a cooperation of the supine Canadian government and the Trudeau regime as we had. And after this, a group called the Northern Illinois bottle cap balloon brigade, phoned in to say, that might have been one of ours because we last tracked it over Western Alaska and it was heading east with the wind. And we have one of these apps that allows us to plot where it would have ended at that point that the F-22 fired and, yeah, it kind of looks like ours. This thing costs about $12. It's a bunch of coated plastic with it. And I was shot down at the expense of probably a couple of million dollars at the very least by an F-22. So I guess the big scare is over, not that it ever made any sense. Nobody's going to apologize. Nobody's even embarrassed, but they'll shut up about it. People so badly wanted to believe, first that it was trying to, the maggot people really wanted to believe like there was a whole China threat there. But then everybody else really wanted to believe aliens had to have something to do with it. And they just thought it was so cool. It's like, no, it's just so much more depressing and grim than that. It's just spending a ton of money and working out your just like decadent, fricking imperial pathologies on some poor balloons. It's pathetic. I mean, there's nothing else. It's actually, it should be fricking really embarrassing, but as you said, no one's embarrassed at all. And I think it's considered treason to be embarrassed. It plays in to Russian's hands if you're embarrassed about it. Yeah. Yeah. So that's where we are. What a joke. I remember I had a friend, Alan, yeah, Alan Colson Wall Street Journal, I remember him telling me he was really getting into some years ago into weather balloons. He's like, you can make them go so high up and it's really cool. And I never really thought much about it. And then here we have that club in Illinois. I mean, that's the greatest thing that'll ever happen to me. Like you get the hat. A balloon brigade. I feel Illinois. You can't top that. America's new enemy. A bottle cap balloon brigade. There's got to be some Kremlin link there. Or Beijing. There's got to be. We got to find that. Yeah. Well, I remember a movie called The Red Balloon. Hey. Yes. Yes. Think about it. Yeah. All right. Anyway, thanks again to our guest Ann Newman. And thank you, everybody. And I'll talk to you again soon. OK. Thanks, everybody. Bye.",
