    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. Today is January 9th, 2023. I'm the coast of Mark Ames here in Snowless Rochester, New York, formerly known as the Snowyest City in America. Not even a dusting of snow here. I'm in line with Warner, Gary Betray, John Dolan in Trieste, Italy. John, how you doing? How was your new year? It was nice. But right now we're hosting Jenny Brown and Michael Pollock, Friends of the Show and prominent Radio Warner citizens. There is enthusiastic about Trieste as we are, which is why it's sad right now because we're going to have to leave in a week or so. Oh yeah, that's a bum. Do you know where you're going next? Tunisia for a little while and then maybe we'll go to the UK because it's out of the EU. We have to get out of the EU. Our official six month visa has never showed but our time is up and we've got to get out. I guess now would be not the worst time because the dollar I think is like in one of its rare stronger moments. It is. Yeah. And so the UK might not be totally prohibitive at the moment. No, and we don't want to go to London this time. We want to go somewhere more interesting and somewhere with an indoor pool because my knee has been kind of a mess. Yeah, I'd like to swim. So you know, find a cheap hotel near Glasgow or something. Right. So you might go up to Scotland. Yeah, I've never been to Scotland. Yeah. It could be chilly up there. Yeah, well, I don't think so. It hasn't even been chilly and dressed and it used to be famous for its winters. I mean, it's kind of sad. The world is well, the world that I knew is dying, just physically dying. And no doubt there will be other worlds. But you get kind of attached to the world that you thought was eternal. Yeah. Well, anyway, out of happier notes. Let's get to our guest. We do have a great guest and a great talk today with Jack Murphy, previous radio-warnerd guest, to talk about this absolute bombshell of an article that we'll get into about CIA running some funny stuff in our nuclear-powered rival Russia. It's an amazing article. Maybe the most astonishing thing about it is that so few other news sources have picked up on it. Yeah. They're shying away from it, as they say. And so we'll talk about all of that. So let's get right to our talk with Jack Murphy. Okay. We're really excited and honored to have back with us. Jack Murphy, Jack was a guest, Eons ago, radio-warnerd episode 61 on Syria, Jihadis, and Chicken Hawks. That was back in 2016, which seems like freaking Eons ago now. Anyway, Jack is a Special Forces vet and journalist and author of numerous books, including his memoir, Murphy's Law, fiction books, nonfiction books. I mean, it makes me feel bad about myself. If I name all the books, I'm just not going to name. Anyway, we'll post a lot of links up here. He's also the author of a lot of really great investigative journalism pieces. I mean, I remember seeing on Yahoo News, the CIA, I mean, I was reading the headline, the CIA-centered team of four operators on a spy mission targeting China and none came back. Pretty big deal. And other big pieces for Yahoo News. And Jack is the author of a real bombshell story that just came out. We'll talk about also the story about the story, but the headline that he has here is the CIA is using a European NATO allies spy service to conduct a covert sabotage campaign inside Russia under the agency's direction. The agency's the lead, which the CIA is using. Anyway, about the CIA running a European NATO allies spy service to run sabotage ops inside of Russia to disrupt Russia's war in Ukraine. So first of all, just welcome back to the show and thanks for coming on, Jack. Yeah, man. Thanks for having me. You were just saying just before we started rolling that there's a big story going down right now at Fort Bragg. And I saw a little bit of Seth Harp, who was also on the show earlier last year, talking about this, but you actually have a piece coming out, which should be out certainly by the time we post the show. Can you tell us what's going on there? Yeah, yes, that's actually writing a book about this stuff. And I mean, he's got, he's going to have plenty to write about. I'm glad he's working on it because that's a full time job in of itself. Right. But so, yeah, I mean, it's difficult to know like where this story begins and certainly we don't know where it ends. But long story short, last week, some special forces member, Dan at Fort Bragg, was picked up. He moonlights as a bouncer at a special forces bar in southern Pines, North Carolina. And as I've been told, he was also pimping underage girls. A lot of these girls, you'd say they're like 19, they're really like 15. And he was also with another guy, you know, a guy who was heavy in a drug trafficking. Both of these dudes were in first battalion, third special forces group. And they, I mean, basically I've been hearing stories about these drug fueled sex parties around southern Pines with a lot of special forces guys. And, you know, at these parties, it's, you know, who knows who walks through the door. I've heard that there are some, you know, fairly high ranking people who have been involved at various times. So, they picked those two guys up over the week. The, it's unclear if they sang like songbirds or if they just ripped the cell phones or maybe both. But what that led to was them questioning a whole bunch of people across various special operations commands on Fort Bragg guys in special operations, army special operations command in the special warfare training group at third special forces group in Delta Force. And they did like a drag net at the gates and they stopped these guys as they came through, started questioning them. I'm told they even questioned the third group physicians assistant. Because some of the drugs going around are like fentanyl and fentanyl alley pops like controlled substances that probably came out of the, the medic cabinet on at the unit. So they questioned all those guys. And meanwhile, I mean, there's all kinds of just rumors and fear and panic ripping through the special forces community over the weekend. Guys are flushing their drugstash down the toilet. I, you know, due to all Russian to hide their nefarious activities, there's rumors that this is going to get tied to a number of murders and suspicious deaths around the Fort Bragg area over the last couple of years. Yeah. I mean, is it related to that? Because it seems like special forces had a kind of something like immunity for a while. And then so many scandals started popping up around Fort Bragg. But that was, yeah, there's definitely, you know, you know, Billy Levine killed his best friend, Mark Leshakar. You know, Billy was in Delta at the time. Leshakar was in SF. And then Levine and Dumas are found dead on a training site at Fort Bragg. I had a law enforcement source confirmed to me that Dumas was in fact connected to international drug trafficking. That he was partnered up with a former police officer and they were smuggling drugs from Mexico to the United States. And there's a whole interesting story there about how the cop, he got fired over some bullshit. It was like, it was kind of petty stuff he got fired for. And he started a legitimate import export business running, washing washer, washer, dryers down to Mexico. And then like any entrepreneur starts thinking, well, I'm making the trip down here but then I'm coming home empty. So because he was a cop and I believe he was a canine cop also like he knew the procedures very well. He had a whole like almost religious ritual he went through where he'd wiped down the satchels of cocaine with ammonia. And then when he drove across the border, he'd have like open containers of ammonia in his vehicle to throw off the drug dogs. And he could try it on it on his own dog like, Brandy, you smell anything? Yeah. And it all started coming out because him and Dumaas did, they pretended to be police officers and they've rated like a rivals trap house down in that North Carolina, Fayetteville area went in and like federal agents hands in the air, bitches. And the old lady and the old woman in the house had a heart attack. They cut the flex cuffs off and they were like, they legitimately were like, we're not here to like actually hurt anyone. And they let the family call EMS. And the EMS, the ambulance arrived as those two jabronies were peeling off target. And like so the EMTs run into these two guys pretending to be cops and they have a brief conversation and then the two guys take off and the EMS is like something doesn't feel right about those dudes. Yeah, sure enough the police. We need to see. Yeah, yeah, the police figure out that these guys were posers. And then the next thing, Dumaas, I believe Dumaas and Billy both had pending court dates. But then they both turn up dead and the former police officer, he's in prison on the drug charges. And who obviously there's still a murderer on the loose, somebody killed Dumaas and Billy. And we don't know who, but FBI got involved in that investigation, which one could speculate that that would imply that there is either definitely across state lines, but perhaps an international connection to the case. So I only bring all that up because I think the notion that a Pimp and a drug dealer were arrested last week and that led to them, you know, this massive bust over the weekend kind of defies like the bureaucracy simply does not move that quickly. So I think there's probably a much larger investigation. And then on Sunday, they did a 100% recall of first battalion, third special forces group where this stuff is all centered around and you know, had everyone show up in uniform and they piss tested the entire battalion. So all kinds of guys are going to piss hot because of that. And this scandal is expected to kind of like spread outwards, like sprawl outwards to the other battalions, you know, as the week goes on. That's crazy, man. How does that get so out of control? Is it because they're given a lot of leeway and expected to be sort of renegades in a sense, or like how does that get that out of control? Man, there's a lot that goes into that. I mean, there's a lot of cultural things and also like lack of accountability, you know, with the command. I'll just say for example, like when I was in Ranger battalion, we got piss tested all the time, sometimes multiple times in one week. Like they would like do a piss test and then there's those, you know, supposedly those people are going to go smoke a joint the next day figuring we won't get it again for a month. Right. So they'll just piss test you the next day. Like, I got you like they, they, they piss tested us religiously. When I got to special forces, I was never piss tested once. I don't recall a single, a single piss test that we did while we were there over the course of like however long I was there. I think they just don't want to, they don't want to know. I mean, it's a classic case with this and so many other things. No dad and no problem, right? Right. Right. Okay. And they want guys to be not totally necessarily straight laced in the mindset anyway. Am I right? I mean, so or or it's a strange culture because it's a special force. This is unconventional warfare. Exactly. Yeah. You're expected to bend the rules. Right. So like if you have to grow a beard while you're overseas or you know, maybe the partner for sure with is like, hey, we're going to take a shot of vodka because we're celebrating like that that's strictly against like army, you know, UC MJ, but as an SF guy, you're expected to like, hey, we, we operate in a gray environment. We're going to break the rules sometimes, you know, but it's a question of doing what rules to break. We're like, we're going to break like the like facial hair rules. We're not going to break like the work crimes rules, right? Right. So it's there's like a, there's a scale of what's sort of acceptable behavior. And you know, if you end up in a unit with a certain culture, with a certain leadership, with with leaders that want to turn a blind eye to things, it gets worse and worse and worse. And you know, so I think this is something that's been percolating really for decades. I mean, this stuff has always been in special forces. But I think you have certain clusters where it's allowed to fester and it just gets worse and worse until it boils over like this. So Seth Harbs going to have a lot as you said. Oh, yeah. He's going to be busy. He's going to be busy. Okay. So we'll also look for your, where's your piece coming out? It should be on connecting vets. And I mean, actually, it should be, it should be published today. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, then we'll be able to link to it. Connecting vets. Yeah. All right. But let's get to your, your big mom, shall I go the reason that we wrote to you? We, I mean, we posted this on the radio, Warner, Facebook page and, you know, had, and had some just like a lot of discussion about it. And one thing I noticed though, and first of all, it's just, it's, there's a lot we want to talk about here. The story itself, first of all, and then also the story about getting the story out. But it's, it's a, it's a big story. And it has not gotten, or I mean, I was looking for some, and maybe I'm wrong. I was looking for other reactions from other blue check types, who are covering sort of that area and the war and so on. The only one I really saw who had something to say about it was the economist defense correspondent, what's his name? Shoshank Joshi. Yeah. Who was kind of like, you know, cautious about, you know, saying, hmm, this is interesting. I'm not sure maybe. But then when people, other blue checks kind of moved into his, his mentions and tried to shoot it down. He, he defended it. So it wasn't like he shot it down. But so I guess first of all, why don't we talk about the story? Can you just describe the story, first of all? Long story short is that a NATO ally had been operating cells within Russia for a long period of time, probably going back 10 to 15 years. And after the 2014 invasion of Ukraine, the United States partnered with that, with that country's intelligence service and essentially turned up the dial. They ratcheted it up and began contributing to that effort. And the first teams, the first sleeper cells that were sponsored by the United States, by the Central Intelligence Agency, you know, that had, that was overseeing it. They went into Russia in 2016. And since that time, these, this allied intelligence service and that units or that, that country's kind of terrorism service has trained these cells. These are civilian groups. Absolutely. They are non-American, no-American citizens involved, running them through mission rehearsals. And then they have been inserting into Russia, sometimes smuggling in the equipment they need. Sometimes they are working out of cash site locations that have been in the ground for 10 to 15 years. And the cells were laid dormant until the invasion, Russia's invasion of Ukraine back in February. And two days before the invasion, the cells were activated. They went and they dug up the equipment out of the cash locations and prepared and they stood by. They had, you know, done target reconnaissance. They knew what they were doing and they were ready to go. And they began receiving the green light to begin striking targets. And this is what you've seen pretty much since day one of the invasion. Just about it began where you saw rail lines being hit, you saw fuel depots being hit, ammo depots being hit. And then as the war went on, you started to see warehouses, power stations, things like this burning to the ground. There is a building belonging to the Russian aerospace ministry or something like this that also burned down pretty early on in the conflict. And so a lot of these mysterious fires that you're seeing in Russia are, yes, they are what you think they are, that there is an intelligence behind them. When you look at them and it looks like, hey, there is a target engagement criteria being used to engage these targets. It's happening so quickly. It's like they were preselected like there's a target reconnaissance that was done ahead of time. There was. And that's what you're seeing at play. I guess one question we kind of had was, are there other examples you can think of where the CIA kind of managed or took sort of overall responsibility or top level responsibility for an allies operation in a third country, a hostile or targeted country. Has this happened much before? I mean, I'm trying to, I feel like we've done this with Israel in some third place before. But maybe Israel wouldn't subordinate themselves as the CIA and that I'm not sure. This is I think in Russia is pretty unprecedented, but this type of operation is hardly anything new. This is something that US Special Forces has been doing to various extents since the 1950s. The CIA has been working on stuff like this for the last 75 years. We work by with and through partner forces. And that's what you're seeing here. Working through a partner force to put yet another force into a third country. We've done this in there were sabotage operations launched from South Vietnam into North Vietnam with American signals intelligence supporting it. It's a very very similar template as to what we've seen in Russia. We did sabotage operations in Nicaragua in the 1980s. mentioned in the article is in 2003 we we being in America the the CIA sent paramilitary guys into North Iraq and trained up curds a bunch of Kurdish cells as saboteurs and they went behind enemy lines in the Saddam Hussein's Iraq and they sabotaged a rail line in terms of like a 90 car train on its side. They blew up the office of Iraqi intelligence official. So they were out there behind enemy lines just kind of wreaking havoc. They were also launching propaganda operations inserting like radio transmitters that would override local radio stations and transmit coalition propaganda. So yeah this sort of thing is hardly unprecedented. The use of a second government's intelligence agencies as a kind of shell company let's say subvert the third country. That seems like something that you would do only in this case because among other reasons those other countries didn't have a large and ready nuclear arsenal. You have to be a little more careful. Yeah well I mean as as my source is described to me I mean this was part of President Biden's condition on green lighting this at all is that it had to go through a third country that you know the CIA could not be directly involved like directly have their hands on these cells and be putting them into Russia. You know our relationship with this country I mean it's very much a partnership. We have run intelligence operations with them in the past to the point that we will train their operatives and they will run the operation for us. You know in a manner that's mutually beneficial I mean it's a relationship that goes back many decades. Yeah you made a point of saying they're not a proxy as in they choose what they're going to go in. Right it's a long-standing partnership that goes back a long ways and you know when we look at Russia and you know a lot of people say like it's or some people would express skepticism which I understand is you know the agency could never do this they couldn't do this because of this reason and that reason and the capability and capacity etc etc and I mean yes Russia is denied territory to the United States. The CIA's personnel working out of the embassy in Moscow or under heavy heavy surveillance I mean they're under harassing surveillance all the time. However who is Russia denied to it's denied to America is it denied to our liaison and the various partners that we liaison with and they may be in a very different situation. Can you talk about what sort of you know assistance the the CIA gives is it in planning is it in training is it in intelligence is it equipment. They're not again not directly hands on doing the training but they're doing the overseeing and the managing the oversight and target selection intelligence distribution and then the United States also with our capabilities and like signals intelligence are providing that sort of like reach back element. Yeah you mentioned that this was has been using cells that had been set up 15 years ago which would be high in. Yeah which would put it before the the Crimean annexation so some agencies have clearly been working on setting up sleeper cells inside Russia for a long time. Yeah I mean there are other countries in Europe that have national security interests and good reasons to be wary of Russia based on history and you know they're my article is really concerning a particular country that the agency that the CIA has partnered with to run these operations but there are other players in the game there are a number of other operations that activated there you know what I came to find out were long standing Cold War era resistance networks that they activated when Russia invaded Ukraine and those networks play a part also in running surrogates into Russia and those have a pretty dicey history I mean there's the obvious gladi and we did a I don't know three part series a while back on on gladio although our Italian guest on that would say that gladio was not the real part of the story it was really the Italian it was all pretty much like an mostly an intra-Italian thing but yeah I think I think that is probably right and you know I I have certainly read whatever is publicly available out there you know gladio being the term we've given to the Italian stay behind networks during the Cold War I know there's certainly conspiracy theories out there about that the CIA killed all the more and all these sorts of things and I mean I'm I'm open to the evidence if it exists but I haven't seen any well I think the idea is that gladio and other stay behind networks as they as they became sort of frozen because they weren't needed in the you know the Soviet Union didn't invade in the 50s and so but those the networks that were set up and the kind of off books money and weapons and then the networks within the intelligence you know set like units within intelligence agencies like created opportunities for you know actors to turn that to political ends like domestic political ends and that makes sense yeah I think that's probably how that happened right and um that may or may not play into some of the things I've been told about these networks that under existing laws the CIA cannot work through a proxy force and just sort of wash their hands clean of it you know based on like a lot of that stuff that happened in Central America we can't just say oh well the countries are you know they went rogue and they did what they did the wrong thing and they wiped out this village you know it's not our fault right that there are some legal stipulations um that mean the CIA has to have some command and control over these elements um they can't just leave it to a third party and wash their hands of it really and that's interesting because they do that or at least did that all the time I don't know maybe they don't need more but aren't they kind of famous for doing stuff like that or no it certainly has happened in the past and I think there's some caution about it I say yeah you mentioned the difference between uh CIA paramilitary and the kind of armed forces special forces that that you were discussing in in Fort Bragg is is there a rivalry or attention between those groups US special forces you know as being active duty military component really isn't a part of the article that I wrote although Gisok does play a supporting role um but is there a tension there between CIA and special forces so there's actually you know back to the agencies inception there is a nexus uh where special operations uh overlaps with CIA and you know maybe the best example to encompass this is the omega teams that were active in Afghanistan interact um in in which you had active duty uh rangers and uh seal team six operators in a sense seconded to the CIA and working under title 50 authorities in those countries uh so it kind of fuses the capabilities the direct action strike capabilities of the military with the intelligence gathering abilities of the CIA which in a sense I mean you can look back at McVeaseog and Vietnam is almost being like the prototype of this sort of uh the template um for this formula that has been repeated many times so what's back to the saga uh military assistance command Vietnam studies and observations group these were the teams that would go behind the lines and Laos and Cambodia and North Vietnam during the war okay and um you know the so that it's these relationships continue um you know special forces has worked you know with you know agency programs uh through the X shops in their units you know uh you know J3X or J2X or whatever they're calling it now and in in these special forces units um and guys will be either seconded to the agency for certain programs or um or directly you know an ODA will work uh uh a tasking but um at the same time on some level I would say it's it's more on like a gentlemanly level there there are um policy debates of like where should covert action authorities reside should it reside with CIA or should it reside with special forces um and you know that debate goes back and forth um I think you could probably make some valid arguments back and forth right um you know Jsock Jsock has this sort of unprecedented man hunting um you know quick or no notice hunter killer capability that they can launch anywhere in the world on very short notice and conduct a hostage rescue or a raid against the terrorist organization or any any number of you know they even have like a counter proliferation um capability um they can be tasked to do all sorts of different things now if you went to the CIA special activities division or now the special activity center and said hey can you quickly deploy you know uh uh 30 ground branch guys to go do this secret mission in this part of the world the agency doesn't necessarily have that kind of capability um but they do have you know what they I think they do better at is you know whereas the US military wants to deploy like 150 operators for a job that takes three guys and they bring in like all these like trucks and deploy half of the air force and all of this stuff the CIA they have more of a culture that is accepting of like hey we're just going to deploy like two guys um and they're just going to go into this area and they're going to be low key and they're going to assess the situation and you know come back and write up some reports and you know what we'll take a sort of like deliberate um small scale action that doesn't involve you know like two thirds of the black budget to get it done yeah okay excellent I got to ask good sort of dumb dumb guy questions because so when you say the when the military wants to do some kind of special operation and then they would overdo it or something the CIA would go light but you were also sort of contrasting somewhat J J sock with CIA and maybe you just meant sort of in terms of what they're off what you know how how quickly they can authorize or how secret they can be but is when you say the military you don't mean J sock you're talking something a separate thing or not I mean I guess I'm talking about the military you know special operations community and then we could drill we could drill deeper into like J sock and then special forces which is not you know necessarily J sock unless it's a certain um they're part of a task force um and I don't know how deep you want to get into the weeds on that but you know CIA can move very quickly um it in congress has quite a bit of authority to release funds uh to them and you know the chain of command is also on a very short fuse I mean from the president to the director of the CIA um down to you know maybe the the director of the special activity center um so it can go pretty quickly um but what I'm saying is that the CIA doesn't have that sort of like um strike capability that the military has that the the military has this really amazing ability to um you know they they have like I think the they call it the bullet package where we can deploy you know Delta Force operators a full complement of of helicopters from the 160th um we can deploy Rangers uh as needed it and just shoot them out literally anywhere in the world in you know hours and and they can be prepared to conduct a whole myriad of uh special operations missions and the CIA just they they could not do that on their own right I guess one thing I uh that seems different this time is that I remember when we talked to you about Syria there's maybe I'm getting this wrong so tell me but there seemed to be a really deep disagreement about policy where the CIA was going more for the I don't care if they're jihadis just give them whatever they want we're trying to bring down Assad and uh the special forces who were tasked with this said no we don't like these guys we don't want to and it seems like this at the moment in Ukraine there's there's more general consensus right I agree with that and you know I'm actually writing more about Syria um me and uh me and Sean Nail are working on various stories and and kind of revisiting some of these topics because there's a lot that hasn't been covered yet um but yeah I agree with that there was a lot of tension in the Obama administration itself um in a lot of tension between the Department of Defense and the Obama administration that uh Obama and president Obama himself had no reluctance about using lethal force on America's enemies um but he had advisors around him who are much more cautious uh uh and wanted to keep the military on a tight leash and it wasn't until ISIS blew across the border into a Goverma soul and then and then damn near overran or bill that suddenly they started taking ISIS seriously and um that that also opened up the door for us to hit other targets like the Korasan group which you know they were al-Qaeda uh organization that was plotting external operations looking at aviation I mean all all the triggers that would freak out the CIA and the intelligence community like like red alert um so that that's uh ultimately it took catastrophe to get the administration to take action and then by the time they did it was really too late I mean there were really no effective moderate rebels left in Syria they'd all been consumed by jihadist organizations and that left precious little for the CIA and special forces to work with when it came uh to finding a viable partner force so I think contrasting this with Ukraine is is especially important um because in Ukraine yeah as you mentioned it's like we were finally not just us but NATO um in our allies I mean we're all fighting in one direction for the first time in a really long time and uh there there does seem to be a general consensus that we found a viable partner force with the Ukrainians um these guys aren't like the Iraqis where we had to provide them you know constant 24 hour air strikes to get them to move a hundred meters forward and um in the fight against ISIS you know the the the Ukrainians certainly need our support but like these guys are I mean they're pretty wild I mean they're they're willing to fight and they're willing to fight for their country you know again another um comparing contrast is gony disappearing from Afghanistan dead at night you know like a week or two after he said I will I will stay here and fight and die from my country and then he packs his suitcases and disappears in the middle of the night you know by comparison Solinsky you know he admirable he decided to go down with a ship um yeah and um you know there's a whole there are you we're covering like some really broad stuff and there are many many stories within that that haven't been written yet I mean we did uh we did a lot of things to make sure Solinsky stayed safe um we sent in advisors uh to advise the Ukrainians on unconventional warfare um there there's a lot of stuff that took place you know in those opening weeks of the war um in Ukraine itself and again that that's like completely aside from from the article I wrote I mean these are other stories Seth Harper told us he had information that um yeah early on before people were talking about I guess that Jsock was operating inside of Ukraine and uh and he got like swarmed on Twitter and you know you have to like know that you don't respond in Twitter to anything but uh he was kind of he was kind of like a little rattled by it and then he was really annoyed that he let himself get rattled by it but he did get that he's right uh there is uh there's a there's a CIA station in Ukraine uh when Russia invaded we evacuated everybody like there was legitimate thoughts that the country would collapse and when that didn't happen everyone came back in like maybe 48 hours later we sent guys back in uh and um that station has a cap on it there's only like I don't I don't know exactly what the number is it's probably like 200 300 people that are allowed you know just like you heard about you know in Syria we had a cap and it started at like a hundred and then it went up to 500 and then it went up to like 1500 and etc etc there's something like that I'm going on in Ukraine and uh yeah Jsock guys will filter in uh they will train the Ukrainians to do this or that and then they will leave uh leave the station and be back filled by somebody else working a different mission um so yeah I've heard stories about like Jsock guys going in there and training the Ukrainians to use non attributable uh radio jamming equipment that they're deploying against Russian forces um things like this I want to get back to your article again but I just got to ask since we're still on this and I I mean it's you know it's great to talk about even the just the war with you and what you know um but so so our intelligence really thought not that I knew at all because I didn't even think Russia was gonna invade into the last minute um but uh our intelligence really thought that Russia was gonna fight or invade much more effectively and actually sweep through and take and more that wasn't just I mean they genuinely believe that at first is that right I mean it's what they say anyway but I mean there there was definitely thought that the country was gonna go down um yeah and I uh again their volumes will be written about this I suppose in retrospect but um yeah I think they did believe that the country was gonna collapse and I I mean this this is gonna be a really interesting assessment and I'll be fascinated as anyone to read about it like did the Ukrainians overperform beyond what we thought they could or did the Russians underperform right way below what we thought they were capable of or maybe both of those things happen at the same time yeah yeah especially the underperforming Russians like yes okay I I should just confess I'm an old guy I grew up during the Cold War and my impression was that uh infiltrating the USSR was pretty much impossible for the CIA another Western forces maybe maybe the British did a little better sometimes but they also were more penetrated themselves but now you have this amazing passage that I want to quote um the overlapping nature this is from Jack's article um the overlapping nature of the various covert action campaigns behind Russian lines has created problems for the Western spy services running these missions over the summer it became clear to CIA officers that there was increasingly a need for deconfliction among their own surrogate forces in Russia according to two former military officials numerous incidents took place in which rail lines or power lines were cut that unintentionally interfered with other missions one of them said that's that's like a life of Brian when the two groups were giving each other into the palace like there's that many uh um you know uh subterge team working in Russia like stumbling over each other yeah so I mean also understand like they're they're probably I mean they're like I said there are different countries running different cells in there and um but they're probably all operating on um on a somewhat standard target engagement criteria and the targets they can hit or limited by you know the targets that they can hit like these teams probably don't have the capability or the capacity to like what say military bases like if they could hit a military target that's exactly what they would do that that would be the highest priority targets right is military um but those targets are are difficult because of the security around those types of installations uh I've been told like another thing they were targeting was bridges um but the bridges increasingly became under guard as well so you start to look then for softer targets um you know like uh I don't think I wrote about this in the article but because the bridges were being watched they started looking at actually destroying roads and they were looking at smuggling cratering charges into Russian destroying the roads um and that's that's just an example of how like you you're having to you know like a gorilla you know swims amongst the population like a fish in the water blah blah leave in the wind all that nonsense right um that they're they're they're looking for softer targets and in at least one instance yeah the two two cells ended up stepping on one another um they were they were you know casing the same target and it led to them compromising one another and in other cases I was told that yeah that cells yeah they blew up stuff that ended up interfering with other covert operations um there there is some you know method to the madness even though the cells are operating in like a very decentralized manner um in that the strikes carry um you know you could argue that these are all tactical targets that they're not really strategic targets and that they um they're more like harassing harassing psychological effects basically yeah exactly that they they carry a psychological component to say hey look we're here and um it's quite intentional that we you know you know whether it's a NATO partner or or the United States intelligence community haven't established a um a front group right like for propaganda purposes you might establish like some sort of make believe terrorist organization and like we're the you know Russia rising or the Russia front group or whatever right and our communist yeah yeah you do you do some uh you do some like uh jihad john videos where you run a bala klawv and brandish an knife and you say Russia you have 36 hours to vacate you create you know that kind of it's intentional that they have not done that that no group is claimed claimed credit um because they're trying to send the security services just scrambling to find these people and by them doing that it bogs them down it keeps them busy and and it spreads them thin which opens up the door potentially for other operations yeah that makes perfect sense i mean almost payment for james jesus angleton and it is it is mold tracking that almost just yeah you know i don't think you're wrong though when you say that the ability for like you know a CIA officer to go undercover in Russia and like blend in and disappear and establish networks is like basically impossible i mean i don't think that's wrong you've seen i mean even during the cold war and i think it's true today the the action as far as recruiting russians is not in Moscow it's not in Russia it's never been in russia i mean even burlin was like too hot um so that the action became africa and and we were you know the reason why cia was so active in africa was simply because we're trying to recruit russians working out of embassies there um you know there there were um we're recruiting guys like uh there's one famous spy i mean we recruited a guy out of the russia station in bogata um so it becomes this sort of game uh where you know the the rest of the world becomes the playground um but russia itself is denied territory for us one of the obvious questions that comes up from this is um i mean isn't this isn't this dangerous like if the well first of all i mean publishing this story if you know about it then you have to assume that the fs bed uh you know the russian intelligence has already known yeah they have been yeah right so they know obviously because there have been explosions that are and you know rail cars that have gone on and they know the difference between like an angry teenager throwing a bottle of cocktail into a recruiting station and you know a tactical strategic target being hit with precision right so they so it's not like your article is going to precipitate world war three but i mean some some people would argue that but no i i think i think that's pure you know science fiction yeah i mean that would be you know quite a feat if you can launch through your through your personal website but yeah uh but i guess the question is though it is is it isn't it dangerous nevertheless for the us to have um well i guess okay that let me put the pull this back russia knows that there have been that there's some kind of sleeper cell you know sabotage activity going on inside of its territory did it know that this CIA was kind of patronizing this uh i've been told that yes they they they know who they know who they're being hit by okay okay you're right it is dangerous i mean we're basically staring down the barrel of a gun like we did during the Cuban missile crisis or other points in history it's a fate the compility uh you're saying yeah we're doing this what are you going to do about it exactly you know from a uh from the perspective of uh you know the american government from the CIA i mean the way they look at it i'm sure i i would think is that um you know the Russians were fucking around in our backyard too uh that you know they tried to assassinate that dude with uh radio you know a novel radioactive substance in the uk um that there's been gr gr you guys screwing around in europe um that they tried to screw around with our election in 2016 so i mean they they probably you know i i would agree that this is an escalation um but i i think it's also very interesting to see you know some of the comments i spoke to um michael koffman who's a russia analyst when i was a particle yeah yeah and you know he he points out he's like there's this real fear when it comes to um competition or conflict between superpowers or great powers whatever we call them um that we would stumble into war right that we would take an action that's misinterpreted or we would we would step across a red line that we don't necessarily know is there and that will lead to this larger conflagration um potentially sparking world world three but what he points out is that this is not really how the apparatus of the state thinks that they they look at these things and a case by case basis and they determine the ROI uh and russia has they obviously know these sabotage acts are happening in their country but they have pretty much chosen to turn a blind eye to it uh they've written a lot of it off as you know just random occurrences um they haven't made a big stink about it and then when you look at the um Nord Stream pipeline yes i was going to get to that but yeah and uh you know i i can't tell you factually i know what happened there i don't um and publicly um you know they're saying there really isn't any evidence um and i think my sources don't have any evidence either and they but they told me their working theory is that it was the Russians um they they certainly said it wasn't us they're like we we would not touch a target like that at this time you know if open war broke out maybe it would be different but um you know needless to say that that happened and what if we had to say about that like what is our response then and i would argue that we've largely chose to ignore that right the Swedes conducted their own investigation it was apparently very thorough and then they said we're we're not going to be telling anybody what we found out right well and they leaked a politico or you know unnamed European officials leaks a politico that they don't have any evidence it was the Russians and it's hard to how do you interpret that i mean because it seems to me whoever did it this is the weird thing about it like i personally i i regret now even saying heavily qualifying and saying if i had to say who did it and i have no freaking idea and i don't want to predict blah blah blah but it would seem because there's so many downsides for either side doing it right that the Russians have already proven that they've done some dumb things that they might have been a little dumber because if it was us or one of our allies i mean it's Russian owned but it's really German critical energy infrastructure so it's really an attack on our ally and start of winter and it happened it happened just as Ukraine was on the offensive right exactly and just as Putin was doing the new mobilization and putting in sort of weekend and like changing everything so it's it seems crazy but like it's even crazy for either side kind of to do it but slightly less crazy for Russia to have done it but i guess you know i guess we'll find out so you so you think it's you would put your money if you had to more on Russia having done it than Poland or the Baltics or i would yes i don't think that the USS Jimmy Carter went in there and destroyed a NATO allies pipeline like i don't i don't i have a really different it would be really stupid right it would be very stupid yes um and um so that that's where i would place my money but i mean i the the jury is still out on that i could factually tell you that's how it went down because i got to say reading your article i started you know first when the plit when political came out and the whole weirdness about not attributing it well i guess what you're saying is one wave interpreting the not attributing you know directly saying okay Russia did this and leaving it kind of open is a way of acknowledging that okay Russia kind of struck back at us or did some sabotage that's sort of at us but sort of not and we're just not gonna acknowledge it either um but another thing i was i thought reading your piece was that sounds like the kind of thing these guys could do and does that mean the CIA would have even known and is that why ratoxakorski tweeted out thank you Biden or whatever you know with the with a bubbling sea um i don't know if you saw that uh no no it is sikorski who is the big you know an apple bombs husband and the big polish to former foreign minister when the Nord Stream uh pipeline first blew up he tweeted out a photo of like the bubbling you know from where the explosion was and said thank you america or thank you Biden or something like that and then deleted it after when jumped on it but uh but anyway so i guess you know it's a great mystery but again it's it's another story that that will have to be followed up and written about and researched in in years to come right i i wish i knew if i if i had something if i had some tea to spill i don't i don't even know but i just don't know right uh let's talk about the publication of the article i think that's one of the most interesting stories here in it i know it starts i guess with with this note that jack you put at the end of this article um mark do you want to read this yeah i gotta say this was a this note alone was um really remarkable and like just really made me uh a lot of respect to you for this and also triggered a lot of bad memories myself and problems i've had every now and then publishing something but i just want to read from this it's a great note okay note on the publication of this article basically why it was on his website uh many will ask why an article of this importance is appearing on my personal website rather than in a prestigious publication i want that detail the entire journey this article took at this time but we'll say that while working with editors at mainstream publications i was asked to do things that were illegal and unethical in one instance and in another instance i felt that a senior cia official was able to edit my article by making off the record statements before he leaked a story to the new york times to undermine this piece i don't regret the intelligence community for doing their job that's their job however i do blame the press for not fulfilling the most basic premise of their job um and then you know you you go into some other stuff some of it which we've covered here um can you uh i mean you know so first of all respect for that but it must be incredibly frustrating having gone through that uh can you talk a little bit more about that about the problems you went through yeah it was um you know the first outlet i took this uh story to they um they had gone through some editorial changes and they told me like hey this is too heavy a lift for us right now and i i think they were being truthful about that the the second one i went to uh i was working with them and this is a pretty sizable outlet right um and they said um they asked me you know could you get a proof and uh you know there's there's about i think six anonymous sources in my story and then a few that are um maybe four or five that are on the record adding context um and they but they asked me if i could get proof and i said well okay what constitutes proof in your mind and they're like well can you get like one of your sources to like take a picture on their cell phone of like an PowerPoint slide or like get a whole of some documents and um well okay i'm not going to do that because it's illegal and unethical as a as a journalist you can't task sources to steal um classified documents but i decided to be a bit of a smartass to tell you the truth and instead of telling them no and and asking them why they're dumb uh i uh instead of that i i said okay sure i'll do that um but i need you to put it in writing in a contract with me uh i need it i need to know i have i have legal protection right and um they're like okay okay sure and uh can you just like put into an email you know for us like what you want us to write in the i'd be i'd be happy to and so i wrote i wrote exactly that i was like i want a contract where you specify that you want me to task sources to break the law and steal classified documents and man you should have seen how fast they backpedaled uh wow that was the funniest damn thing i'd ever seen and i told the guy i was like look man like as i if you had told a younger drummer journalist to do this they might have done it totally yeah they might have done it and then you have uh you know like a reality winter type situation where the government's gonna figure out who that person is and two fucking seconds and they're going to jail um you know maybe maybe the journalist is getting indicted you know uh and what is that what does that do for your your news outlet right yeah so i parted ways with them at that point and uh went over to another outlet and um spent a long time with them working on this article and reworking it and reworking it and it went through a very vigorous fact checking process um i was promised that it would be a proctology exam and that was not a lie um but i i mean i i also understood i understand all of that i mean they're they want to do credible journalism and that's perfectly respectable um that you want to make sure your sourcing is together um and then we came up with a publication plan the plan was that we would go to the CIA for official comment which you have to do is is the right thing we do and we would give them 48 hours to reply right and then 48 hours after that we were gonna publish um okay sounds like a plan got it so uh it hours is a lot actually if you ask me i'd do more to i guess it's the CIA and this is a big story but yeah i mean they were trying to give the agency a fair amount of time to reply while also not giving them enough time to start trying to maneuver around us exactly which is what ultimately happened right um so we go to the agency uh have a kind of a odd exchange with their public affairs people um tell the like we in tell them like hey we need an on the record statement from you guys and they give it which is in the article that's right it's just a flat denial that there's there's no truth to this at all that that this whole story is fair and as you point out by law they are allowed to or yeah required or something to lie about covert activities yeah they have to i i mean they only have to tell the gang of eight that's right yeah um it's and i'll talk a little bit more about that about the ethics of espionage i guess but they i mean yes they're they're certainly within their rights to deny covert activities right and um so then the deputy director of the CIA wants to have a call with us and um wow i uh i told my editor i said that i can talk any time today except you know this time like 150 or whatever it was because i have to go pick up my kid from school right any other time okay so when did that call take place the one time i was not available yeah probably because the the the CIA guy figured you given your background would be let a little less impressed or easily bold over than an editor i don't know i'm just thinking yeah i could only one can only speculate yeah i uh the um he done had a conversation with david koehn the deputy director um they had an off the record conversation uh there was no off the record agreement ever reached between me and david koehn so what he told my editor was that it's the Ukrainians they're rogue Ukrainian operations they're off the rails they're doing their own thing it's not us we have nothing to do with it all right this this makes no goddamn sense whatsoever right um for a whole variety of reasons but i i understand why he would say that it's a great cover story because what what are the Russians gonna do in retaliation they go to the Ukraine they're gonna they're gonna you Kiev uh so okay i got it but now that now the editor's point of view is we need to square the circle to make my story jive with the CIA's off the record statements um and he's going in there and he's editing out essentially any reference in my article to the CIA and making it out to look like it's these are like you create Ukrainian cells um that are just doing their own thing wow and i'm like well why why is this guy allowed to make off the record statements you know maybe it would be somewhat different if he was on the record and we could publish those statements but off the record like i what what um do we do my reporting was uh fact checked and verified and deemed newsworthy you know 15 minutes ago and now we're off on a totally different track you mentioned that he released a story to uh basically preclude or ruin your story that's a classic move yeah basically we we ended up sitting on our hands trying to square the circle and in the meantime like maybe five or six days after that that call happened a story pops up in the new york times and it is a story about this topic um blaming these acts of sabotage on ukraine and saying there's all this tension between CIA and Ukraine uh between america and ukraine because they're off the rails doing these unauthorized ups and we just can't get control over them interesting way that article had a lot of information in it about you uh dukeena in the dukeena assassination and basically like trying to distance the united states from that which again i found interesting because none of my questions to cia once mentioned dukeena yeah yeah that's not your emphasis at all it's more classic military sabotage they they went down that road on their own and um much like the Nord Stream pipeline i mean i i've heard whispers of things about dukeena but nothing that i would really be comfortable saying as if i know or as if it's a fact i think there's more to follow on that but i did find it interesting that you know clearly this story was was leaked um if you would even call it a leak it was handed to the new york times by david koehn what does that say about the new york times man you know that it says yeah you can draw your own conclusions from that um that they're that they're wandering these stories for the cia yeah i was just going to read a paragraph from your uh note at the end of the article that i think is really important uh because when and you try to do a story like this you get accused of disloyalty or something but as but but it's a farce in that way as you say here the russian government knows perfectly well who is sponsoring these sabotage strikes moreover the intelligence community wants them to know the only party left in the dark is the public at large left unaware of the shadow war taking place behind the scenes and that's absolutely true i mean if you think about it for a few seconds you got to realize that of course they know they both know they yeah they just don't want anybody interfering while the proverbial sausage is being made they're choosing to turn a blind eye i mean both sides are in a sense um so yeah it is a game of brinksmanship and um no it's it's been interesting i mean there is a really good a really strong like i think public interest and public response in the article um you know i think that the intelligence community even the people who are pretty loud and and not hesitant to do any shit talking at all were death definitely silent on this one i the um you know the only kind of like pushback i heard was just sort of like you know people saying if this was real you wouldn't know about it and you know since you do know about it it can't be real and even if it was real you shouldn't have reported it and it's like well okay this is circular logic um yeah i'm just i'll just like leave you to it then um and i don't i don't mind the skepticism i invite the skepticism when i first heard about this story i was shocked um i did not but i mean i wouldn't say i was in i didn't believe it i guess i i wasn't sort of a state of disbelief i um but i well started to have um well because it's balsy it's balsy and uh it it it is provocative and i didn't think that um i didn't think we were there yet right like maybe if uh maybe if russia invaded a NATO ally like we would get there right right i was i was i was surprised that we went ugly early uh yeah which uh could be could be good or bad right it could be construed it's good or bad uh raise up an interesting sort of cheap thriller question like does russia have sleeper cells like yeah yeah and i i think that's a that's an interesting conversation too um because i mean we heard the same thing about uh like aran and hezbollah like oh we can't mess with aran because like these hezbollah sleeper cells will wreak havoc across america and i mean we we uh we uh we smoked cheque solomani in bagdad and nothing happened right um and i admit i did i did believe in hezbollah's uh capacity for chaos much more than i did say they do have they do have a history of uh of you know effective uh terrorist plotting and you know maybe maybe part of the reason why it hasn't happened is because solomani was such a singular uh in effective um member of that of cut's force and that the that organization that without him it became more difficult for them to run off right uh which is another conversation but just um yeah i mean if russia had sleeper cells i mean don't you think they would activate them right i mean we know they they did have some sleepers here during the cold war and you know after the wall came down we found out who a lot of them were and um you know mil buren's book talks about um you know like confronting you know like some like guy some check guy living in the middle of america and like he's the soccer dad now and he's like he's like okay well you know you got you got me like can i can i can i stay here though now that i'm here come on my knees i mean yeah you want me to kneel down on a railroad track and put a charge in there now i mean there's also anachatman i mean there were those right there was that's the unofficial yeah yeah um so i mean what is going on here has our counter intelligence gotten so effective all of a sudden um and i'll be the first to admit that there's a level of um of competency being displayed that i that's a little shocking too it's like you know there's that meme about you know it's cia the last 20 years and then they're like we're 9-11 man at and then it's like you know cia in 2022 and they're like yeah we know russia what russia's military is going to do three days before they do yeah um and it like how did this happen and i think there's a i think there's going to be a great story and an interesting story there um you know a counter intelligence story and an intelligence story and um a whole series of things that happen behind the scenes um that haven't been written about yet do you think both western intelligence and then putting themselves sort of over estimated russia's capabilities for the you know initial cocking and invasion plan because of syria but i mean do you think because they they were pretty effective in syria when they weren't i mean russia hadn't really operated beyond its borders like that wasn't supposed to be able to either for that matter and that kind of I mean i remember there's a lot of sort of rage or some some you know out of dc and out of NATO that that they did it and that they did it effectively reasonably effectively i think right in syria i mean they helped you know save Assad's regime and then maybe that led to people overestimating their capabilities is do you think that's bad i mean i think that you have to go back and look at 70 years of russia analysis and you know nothing be overly accusatory but i mean we have to take like a sober look at how we perceive and how we have judged russian capabilities for 70 years you know like i interviewed uh milt one time and he was saying he was like the the cable traffic i sent back um this was during the eighties when he was running the program um in in afghanistan the covert action program from pakistan into afghanistan and he's like the the cables i sent back to langley that i got the most pushback from were assessments about the russian army in afghanistan and he was like you should have seen the venom that they came out with attacking me because i was saying like yeah the russian military isn't performing well like they're not really what you think they are and um i remember interviewing a russian military analyst um pretty early on in the war in ukraine like maybe actually that the first month and she was like this isn't the russian military i've been studying for about five years and um you know i again i mean i don't mean to be overly critical of her or anyone else but i mean the reality is actually yes this is the russian military that we've been looking at for 70 years and the reality is we got it wrong um that we that we overestimated their capabilities and and maybe some of the more sober analysts out there understood like hey they got one aircraft carrier it catches on fire wherever it's go wherever it goes like is this really a global power they really able to project force across the world um and it rather than you know flying sorties and and dumping barrel bombs on civilian populations in olepo is totally different than running complex modern air operations the way the us air force does the initial invasion was i i'm i seem to remember you know watching you on twitter as well just being sort of like what shocks like you get it but it really was that sort of appalling by from everything you could gather i mean me and my friends were all scratching our heads like why have they not gained air superiority right like what what like what are they waiting for like what what's going on here uh that should have been like day one yeah um so yeah it was all very like what i'm talking to people on the ground that the like hap hazard you know way that they were uh assaulting forward and they'd send a you know a few guys one day to attack and then a few guys the next day it's like where is the where is the Russian like human wave that we hear about and stalling grad and like you know they're they're gonna wheel up artillery like they didn't tchets and just in just level grozny like when is that gonna happen and um i mean i'm not i don't i don't mean to sell short the amount of carnage that's taken place in in Ukraine but yeah this isn't the rusho that that many of us including myself thought it was i mean we so we did after the the in the full scale invasion in February last year you know we did a series on the chitchen wars looking back like this invasion made a lot more sense again after that because yeah in a lot of levels the the brutality the economy chitchny was small enough that essentially the Russian armed forces could you know pull back and try again lessons learned and stuff right you really can't do that uh against you but they made very similar mistakes over and over and over like a pauling mistakes but yeah it was small enough they could do it uh yeah i mean it may be kind of um pedantic or or maybe naive of me even to say but i can't help when uh if you you watch that um that television show Chernobyl and you know you as you're watching that and it's kind of telling the story about the the meltdown and you see that like there there were a good people in the Soviet system but they were fundamentally locked into a system that just didn't work mm-hmm yeah i wanted to say one other thing about your note here and you also had this the last part of your note about publishing uh ultimately i felt i was being asked to compromise my work and put careers ahead of my own integrity that's why the piece appears here and that's just great i mean that's inspiring and it should be inspired inspiring for other uh aspiring reporters i mean you should do that and it's um i i was going to say you know in a sense you might have also dodged a career bullet from my experience here because what could have also happened is that um i mean some of my experience like i you know i wound up getting a scoop with a guy right with uh Yashalavine early in 2009 that this at the time small tea party thing was back by these mysterious oil all the guards called the Koch brothers and my scoop got destroyed right and because i didn't have editors abacked me when the heat got turned on and that fucked me out of a great scoop and um your piece might have got published so i did it for playboy and for a whole bunch of reasons they then they took it down then everyone said oh you're the guy that had that taken down it was a real peeing in the ass yeah and then it was really till Jane mayors big piece in New Yorker came out that it was but by then it was just it was ruined and it also like really messed with my head and introduced me to the um just just how many different ways you get you can get screwed in this business and um so you might have dodged a bullet by having full control over it because if you published it in a major publication and then they very quickly caved and they do sometimes especially with something important like this they caved then they retracted they find any god damn little reason possible some words something and they retracted they don't back you and then you're known as the guy anytime you do anything else controversial after that as a guy who had a piece retracted by ex publication yeah yeah so it was smart to pull it out i honestly didn't really think about that um the fact checking in the integrity and all those things are really paramount but there is a component of this job like you got to have some balls yeah like people people are gonna come after you yes you know you have to be confident in your story and in what you do um yeah and you have to really believe your editor and make sure your editor believes in you yeah it's it all depends on the editor in that sense i'll tell you right now a great great editor in this field is Sharon Weinberger who i worked with at Yahoo News she works at Wall Street Journal now i wish i still working with her she's she's really terrific that's good yeah i mean um Paul Carr who we had at NSW it was great uh stood by us on every and we did a lot of controversy stuff and stood by us all the way with that is really important um but uh anyways i i i want to post all this stuff uh links to everything here and i just again want to congratulate you on a great article i mean one one other thing i wanted to say more journalism stuff but i know that one of the uh uh one of the other sort of objections to your story by some of some blue checks or some people who don't want to i don't know except it was oh but the the key sources were anonymous officials and look and non i mean see more hersha's probably as big a scoop ever in the 70s was about the illegal CIA programs spying on americans and that's what spark the church committee hearings and the pi committee hearings and the Rockefeller commission and that was all based on uh anonymous source it was it might have been colby for all we know it was some people very high up in the CIA but um but uh it was anonymous right so it's not that anonymous sources are always there you know people need to like not be stupid about that it's it's about trusting that the not the sources staying anonymous are um i mean this is all just about credibility and trust really right from the journalists and the editors there's certainly an aspect of that i feel like the second you asked people to trust you you're probably not all that trustworthy trust the verify or whatever but yeah exactly i mean i i i i would ask you know read what i wrote seriously and think about that and keep that in mind as we go forward and you know um i think you know 24 months from now the New York Times will publish a story that slowly inches towards this truth and pretend like they came up with it all in the room you'll never be mad at you yeah of course of course yeah i'm just i'm i'm trash and you know but you know the thing with anonymous sources is uh you know if the department of justice would like to stop prosecuting sources then they can be on the record but um so you can take it up with them if you got a problem with it i you know when you're reporting on covert action programs and real time uh it is what it is like sources are going to be anonymous in that case a lot of times you know bad actors use that anonymity to plant bullshit stories and that's why yeah that's what strikes me like uh for these people to suddenly develop an allergy to anonymous sources yes bizarre it's because it's not their anonymous or exactly yeah yeah it's funny to see some of those reactions from people i'd like to push it out as much as we can but have you had a hard time getting either like again we saw the economist guy reacting to him and you know giving it some respect have you had a hard time getting it out to other uh i don't know how many you know people you're friends with in the sort of blue check media world but um not like very few i mean i know i know journalist like i know most of the journalists who cover the same kind of stuff i do you know um so like yeah i i know Seth Harp i know Sean Naylor i know you know these are good guys but i'm not like really networked with the journalism community overall right it's a good thing yeah usually yeah um all right well we'll let you go we've kept you for a long time this been a great discussion and and once again really congratulations on that piece and look for to reading more of your of your journalism in your books and so we'll post links to all that yeah i appreciate it guys uh there's you know much more to follow so thanks for reading sure yeah thanks again thanks okay that was our uh talk with jack murphy great talk by the way really good and um and uh great article and we're gonna post links to it and i have a feeling that that even as we were as we were talking i think that that other piece that he just put out about the police raids and all that stuff yeah for brag i think it already came out so we'll be able to post that as well um anyway i think we could wrap it up that the article on the discussions let the interview stand on because it was fantastic that was great um thanks again everyone thanks to jack and uh talk to you again soon john thanks everybody bye bye until thank you",
