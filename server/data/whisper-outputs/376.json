    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. Today today is April 26, 2023 and this is episode 376. I am the co-host, Mark Ames, here in Rochester, Western New York, and I'm on the line with John Dolen, aka Gary Berture, aka the Warner in Bari, I think still, right? Bari in Italy, right? Oh no, no, we were in Bari for days so we had to move along. We're now in Leccia, much further south and we're looking to buy a house near here if we can. But I want to warn our listeners and apologize in advance because when you move all the time you have to pick a hotel and it's hard to do and you can never quite figure out what it's going to be like. So I picked the hotel that had the highest Wi-Fi rating in Leccia and the Wi-Fi has been great indeed but it's a place with marble floors and thin interior walls so there may be some noises. I'm just looking so Leccia, now I remember you mentioned this last time. I mean, Leccia is at the bottom of the hill of Italy. Yeah, okay, cool. What's it like there right now? It's not hot yet which is kind of a relief. It's actually really beautiful. But I assume there's a lot of pollen in the air because my sinuses are just swollen and my balance is affected and it's kind of a mess especially because this whole region is famous for white stone which I guess is a kind of marble and I don't really want to fall onto white stone. I've done that. Wasn't that fun? For those of us who might be new, John shattered his ona. Your radius and ona or which bones were? It was mainly the ona. Yeah, right through the elbow. Yeah, I don't like that story. Let's not talk about that. I didn't like it much much. Yeah, that was in another part of Italy. Hopefully, I have more of that. So like all the grant, like the payments have all the same sort of white granite or white marble everywhere. Yeah, the sidewalks. Sidewalks, okay. Yeah. So it does teach you useful habits like watch where you put your feet. Yeah. A lot of first worlders don't do that and it amazes me. Like after Saudi, after Kuwait, after Italy, I just automatically look where I put my feet now. I mean, I would I wonder if there's like a particular kind of shoe. I bet you like a sandal, a type of a sandal might be good. I don't know. Something like really low to the ground that might be useful. Well, what I've been thinking of and it's kind of a sad story, but you know, I'm kind of a sad case. Apparently, they've finally invented something that any kid would invent for the problem of motorcycle crashes, which is these giant airbags that fit around you. So that when you have an accident, the thing explodes and turns you into some Michelin man that just rolls and rolls along the pavement. And if you don't actually get run over by a car, you're apparently fine. That would be quite a pop. I mean, yeah. But that sounds like those sort of big inflatable bodysuits that kids have it. And then you run up against each other like at parties or something. But you could just go like that. Yeah, exactly. So you could just say you're on your way to a party, but just always wear it. Yeah. Oh, man. So yeah, well, good luck. I mean, finding a place. Nice. Yeah, there are there are great houses here. I mean, Southern Italy has sort of the feel of rural Ireland in some ways in that you can tell there used to be much bigger population here. And in this case, they mostly emigrated rather than just died, but a lot of them died too. And there's a lot of housing here because there's no jobs. Right. I mean, Brandon and I were talking about how if remote working becomes the norm, it's interesting to think what might happen. Like, you know, people will decide to live by a waterfall in northern Ontario. Right. And that the cities might get, if not deserted, then very much discounted. It's really strange. So what's going on at least in New York City, like you see that I think in San Francisco, pretty big like San Francisco is starting to lose a lot of people. It's San Francisco really sucks these days. So it's good that that's happening. But a place like New York City, weirdly enough, so the offices, the whole office, like commercial real estate, it's all suffering still big time. And they still don't really know what to do about it. And it's a potential like kind of financial time bomb when you think about how much office commercial space is financialized. But at the same time, residential is insane still insane. I mean, if you try to get, you know, just rent an apartment in Brooklyn, New York City, Queens, it's the prices are still going up. They're still getting bit up. It's just and it gets worse and worse than it's which is weird. But I guess, you know, maybe a lot of those people still work at home, you know, room up with roommates in a tight space and yet still remotely work because they just want to be around people and where things are happening. Yeah, I did have that feeling in New York City. And we lived in several parts of it that a lot of people who by the way have a lot of tattoos just want to be around each other. Yes, strange how hominids are like that. Yeah, strange species. Anyway, so today we were going to talk about a couple of things. I think we were going to go back as originally problems. We were going to go back and finish up talking a bit about solombo. And then I wanted to say a couple of words about the infamous nerd leaker of the big Pentagon leaks recently. His name is, well, he was the Air Force military intelligence guy. And I want to say his name is Tijera or Tijera. I'm not exactly sure Tijera. John, what's your name? Yeah, I bought all I know is like 40 years ago. I saw a Brazilian movie called Shika da Silva. And Shika was X-I-K-A. So I'm going with X-S pronounced sure, but then yeah, I mean, which is dumb of me, because Brazilian Portuguese doesn't sound like metropolitan Portuguese. As I mentioned many, many shows ago, when we were in Portugal, everything sounded like Russian except it wasn't Russian, because everything is strong. So who knows, but I'd go with sure. Yeah, I think to show tech Jack Tishir. It's a Portuguese name. Anyway, I wanted to have a say a few words about that story. I don't know, put the leaks or whatever you want to call them in some context. But I don't know, we want to start first with with solombo. Yeah, I'm excited to be able to talk about solombo, because we were going to talk about the Punic Wars after Catherine and I visited the side of Carthage, which is pretty damn amazing over the winter. And we were going to talk about the first Punic War, in fact, the series of Punic Wars, and then move on to the novel that Gustav Flobar produced about the mercenary war that followed the first Punic War, solombo. Episode 368, solombo and the part one, which was when we talked more about the first Punic War. Yeah, yeah, I did a ton of research for that episode, and I was really worried about it, that I might get some date wrong, because there's a hell of a lot of stuff going on. And major parts of it don't make sense. There's only one source, the historian Polybius, and the fact that a gimmick, the Corvus, the boarding platform, supposedly changed the entire course of war when it was tried out in its first use by the notoriously unseeworthy Romans. It just didn't make a lot of sense. And I was very worried that I'd get a lot of talk back, and that I might be wrong about something, but instead it was like, I don't know, I don't think anyone knows very much about these wars. So we delayed a bit on the second part of this, but I think the second part will be more fun, because the first Punic War was sprawling, strange, and largely erased, the Romans erased Carthage. Like they didn't salt the fields, apparently a legend, but they might as well have, because they destroyed the memory of it completely. And there's not a lot you can say about it. So I thought we could just go back over very briefly what we said about the first Punic War, Punic meaning the language of Carthage, Punic related to Phoenician, because the settlers who founded Carthage were colonists from what's now Lebanon. And the war leads to the mercenary revolt, the mercenary revolt is a subject of Salembo, one of the great novels ever written. So just to sum up the first Punic War, also called the First Carthaginian War, it's a long war, 264 to 241 BCE, and a strange war, as I said, most of the fighting is about the big Mediterranean islands, Sicily, Corsica. It starts with a dispute between the two empires, Carthaginian and Roman, as they're both expanding in different directions in Sicily, the Romans from the Calabria, from the Italian mainland, and the Carthaginians from the Mediterranean, Eastward across Sicily. And what finally becomes clear is that the Romans are quite bad sailors at first. In fact, the Romans were a laughing stock in the Mediterranean for their initial naval exploits. They didn't know when the storms were coming, and therefore they lost entire fleets. But unlike the Carthaginians who were always betraying each other, and always worrying about the money, the Romans were dedicated to military expansion. In fact, that was the purpose of the state. The Carthaginians were annoyed by military necessity. They didn't really want to bother with it. The business of Carthage was business, and the expenditures for more ships, more mercenaries were always a political issue in the oligarchy of Carthage, and it was very much an oligarchy. And they betrayed victorious generals, crucified, defeated generals, and in general, so to speak, didn't make a military career very attractive, especially because the military career of their best general, Hamilkar Barkha, father of Hannibal, was mixed up with clan fighting, the Barkha's versus the Hanoh family and other clans. So basically, there's a long draining struggle in which the outcome really isn't in doubt because you can't phase the Romans. It must have been terrifying for many of the Romans' opponents. Like, we just destroyed their army. Yay! Well, okay. Next spring, there's another Roman army in the same uniforms. Maybe the faces are a little different, but it doesn't matter. It's the same army, same uniforms, same moves only they learn as they go. So after more than 20 years, Carthage is defeated. They lose their final great naval battle off Sicily, and they lose pretty much their hopes of becoming the dominant empire in the Western Mediterranean. They hand over the rest of Sicily, give up the rest of the islands, release all their Roman prisoners and pay an incredible, incredible penalty, war debt, 82,000 kilograms of silver from the silver mines of Spain. So that's when the mercenary war begins in Carthage, and the subject of Salambo is the mercenary war. It's extraordinary that this novel came to be in the first place. I mean, we're talking, it's said in 239 BC in a place Carthage which had just been erased by the histories written by the victors by the Romans, but in this wondrous leaf of imagination, Flobar, who's just written Madame Bovery and been tried for indecency. Now goes back to ancient Carthage, which has exactly one historical source, Polybius, and he used Polybius heavily in writing Salambo. And he doesn't even pick the most people pick with the Carthaginian story. He picks this much less known mercenary war after the first Punic War, not the war with Rome, but the war against their own angry mercenaries. And it's a beautiful novel, but among other things, it's extraordinary for the range that it displays. Mark, I think you told me once that Limonov said that he admired Flobar most of any writer for doing Madame Bovery, perfect, painful novel about middle-class Moores, and following it up with Salambo. I think we were having one of those rare discussions, the Limonov in general hated literature and hated talking about it. We're having one of those rare discussions about literature and somehow the subject came up of any whatever any great 19th century novels where I think it was by way of putting down Dostoevsky, who he thought was vastly overrated, except for the first hundred pages of crime and punishment, I think is what he said. And then I said, well, an example of what was great. And he said, well, Salambo is the most perfect novel, just muscular, as he called it, muscular, nothing extraneous at all in there. I mean, even those lists, and there are a lot of catalog lists, but they're so tight, they're not it's not like, sometimes you read writers who do who kind of start listing or cataloging things and you just think, oh, they're just trying to show off, but they're not really showing off much at all, or they're trying maybe they're getting paid by the word or something, but it's definitely not the case with Flobar. No, I mean, Bullsack will spend pages describing a room, and it gets a little tedious like, okay, it's expensive furniture. What happened? But yeah, I thought I'd mentioned that one of the critical insights that's really worth remembering about Salambo, and I don't know who said it first. It's been said many times by now, is that Salambo is a catalog of horrors and particularly a catalog of waste. Everything goes to waste. Lives, cities, every artifact created by humankind is destroyed, and to no purpose. You meet all these people, and they're eventually, in many cases, literally torn apart. And one of the great characters of the novel is sort of the ancestor of the Baron Harconan, I swear. I mean, Frank Herbert must have read Salambo when he was young, because when he invented the Baron Harconan, he was thinking of Hano, who is the great opponent of Hannibal's father, Hamulkar, Barca. And Hano is one of the most nightmarish creatures ever invented. So I think I'll just read the initial description of Hano, who is a monster in human form. Hano, supported by two slaves, put his tottering feet to the ground. He wore boots of black felt strewn with silver moons. His legs were swathed in bands like those wrapped about a mummy, and the flesh crept through the crossings of the linen. His stomach came out beyond the scarlet jacket which covered his thighs. The folds of his neck fell down to his breast, like the doolaps of an ox. His tunic, which was painted with flowers, was bursting at the armpits. He wore a scarf, a girdle, and an ample black cloak with lace double sleeves. But the abundance of his garments, his great necklace of blue stones, his golden clasps, and heavy earrings only rendered his deformity still more hideous. He might have been taken for some big idol roughhune in a block of stone, for a pale leprosy which was spread over his whole body, gave him the appearance of something inert. His nose, however, which was hooked like a vultra's beak, was violently dilated to breathe in the air. And his little eyes with their gumed lashes, shone with a hard and metallic luster. He held a spatula of alloy wood in his hand, wherewith to scratch his skin. I mean, okay, so there, as I said, we have all these details, but they're not like furniture details that you're likely to forget there, there are nightmare details. He has to, he's so fat and he's so diseased that he has to lean back to look through his eyes, which are almost gummed shut with pus and other effluvia. And he's holding this spatula of alloy wood because he itches constantly, and he has to scratch his vial skin. And this is just the first of the descriptions of Hano's nightmarishness. He ends up being crucified. And as he's being crucified, his spongy bones won't hold him up when they're nailed through. So pieces of him like gobbets of flesh fall from the cross. And even as he's dying, he's discovering new physical horrors. As I mentioned, Flobar had a medical background at Rann in the family. And even in Madame Bovery, there's all that. He's going to say, Charles screws up somebody. The evil pharmacist sort of forces him to do this experimental operation that kills. I think it does the guy die and kills the hunchback. Yeah, yeah, that's right. That's, it's been so long since I read it. But I mean, that's the other thing though. I think you were talking about this regarding Le Mans of the range. I mean, Salambo is not a funny book. Madame Bovery is a really, darkly, very funny book. I mean, it's brutal and funny. And the people are just so absurd. And this is Salambo. I guess in a way, that's what makes it, it was a huge success when it came out. Yeah. And it's not, and it's not such a success anymore. People don't talk about it much anymore. And I don't think it's just because of the kind of vulgar Edward Saidian, Orientalism. I just think the book, it's very grim. I mean, it's very, it's not, well, I don't know how to explain it. It just kind of exists in its own world. The style and the feel of it. It's very hard. Yeah. And that way, I don't know, I'm, let's not discount the Saidian wimping of these hour times in which we live in as Paul McCartney would say. I you know, by the way, I went through 20 years of hating that song every time it came on because uh, he says in three times, but in this ever changing world in which we live in. And I've always been like a lyrics pattern. And I was willing to be patient with the man and give him two in's. But you can't say three in's and get away with it. And yet he did. This is a great point. You know, I like that song as a kid, but it was only because it was such like apocalyptic epic sort of when most of the songs at that time were this kind of acoustic love. Chee Chee Chee Chee. And this was don't, don't live and let die. But yeah, you're right. You know, in which it's very living in. Yes. Yeah. Very operatic like Bohemian Rhapsody. And there was a shortage of that, you know, at the time, as you say. Yeah, that's funny. That must have really wrinkled your ear when you were here. Yeah. Well, yeah, I, I had a lot of verbal allergies. But I so I do think we live in a pretty wimpy age and that's not going to make salambo anymore popular. But I think, yeah, that it also requires the belief that Carthage existed, that there was such a thing as a punic culture. And this is not, oh, those kids don't learn anything these days. It's more like a lot of people went to a lot of work to get rid of punic culture to destroy it all. So it's kind of hard to summon up. But this, this raises another several questions actually. Salambo, yeah, is extremely grim. It's mainly an account of battles and massacres. There's some great battle scenes, by the way. I know. I'd like to read a little bit of some too. Yeah, but you're right. Yeah. Yeah. But the first question is, why didn't it cause flobera as much trouble as Madame Bovery did? Because to my surprise, I went back and looked at the reaction. It didn't. Yeah. There there are horrors in this novel. But people had no trouble with them. I, because it's a, it's a foreign culture, I guess. And I, I suppose. And it was, I don't know, if France had anything like a Victorian phase at that time, I don't think they did. I don't know. But, but they seem to see this novel, which I find strange reading it today and strange knowing what I thought they were supposed to be like. They, they saw it as a very sexy novel, I think, from what I had, it's like really sexy. I mean, Salambo is a great character. She is, but very otherworldly. I don't see how it's particularly sexy, you know, I don't know. Well, because she, she is in love with Motho, the leader of the mercenaries. And he's in love with her. And he's in love with her. But that can never be. And that too is very operatic. But there's also something, well, kind of niche in, if you want in, in the novel, in that you really have to enjoy suffering. You really have to want to do a close-up of Hano's, Puss-filled sores like, like the Baron's doctor, you know, your disease is Baron. Love to me. And if you can't, I wouldn't say if you can't do that because I think 90% of the world can do that. If you can't admit that and a lot of people can't admit that, then you're going to have a problem with this novel. Yeah, there's an enormous amount of suffering. I mean, whether it's the waste, you talk of the enormous amount of waste, the suffering of Mato and his love, the physical sufferings and all that just grew some killings. But without pity, there's no pity in the novel at all. And so that's what I think is so striking, especially for like high 19th century. Not for Flebert because yeah, he is Nietzschean for lack of a better word in that way. But it's strange, I think there was an audience for pityless and less suffering, I don't know. Yeah, well, to me, there's, there are actually many lessons about this. But I can't help comparing the, this is this novel came out like 1862, the American Civil War era, comparing the high Victorian age in Britain and France and America and Russia, all these literary cultures at the time. And when you, when you think of the caution of and the respectability in the virtue of the British novel, during this period when the British state was doing horrific things all around the world, I mean, I actually tried looking at the most popular British novels at the time of the Great Famine. And first the Irish one, then the Indian one. And there is not a hint of unverchew or vice. In fact, there was one novel, I can't remember the name right now in around 1851 that involved a divorce or something and people were outraged by that. They were not outraged by these horrors that were going on in the real world, but they were outraged by these slight manifestations of non-virtue in their novels. And that to me is one of the most extraordinary things. I actually wrote a newsletter about this saying, you shouldn't be worried about people saying bad things, you should be worried about the silences because they, there weren't any novels about those famines. It just didn't come up. I mean, Terry Eagleton has to go far, far field to say, well, Heathcliff, you know, came out of nowhere as an orphan, maybe he represents the famine casualties. Well, that'd be nice if people were nice, but no, there was no conscience, but there was tremendous virtue. There's something about text. I mean, I don't know, we've seen it very up close ourselves that a lot of people really reacted more violently to offensive satire than to the reality of the things that are eyes. Yeah. I mean, you know, we were in the way of all that, like really deep profoundly offended. And that is something about reading it that really upsets people more than the thing actually happening. How dare you write about it or mock it or whatever, I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, I just wanted to read a passage, a battle passage, and the way to show the way, the Fleurbeard describes a battle, first the armies or, you know, the two sides and then actual battle itself. It's really cool. I think this is the one, this is the battle that happens sort of outside of Urika. Camp followers with slings were spaced out on the flanks. The guards of the Legion and their gold scale, the armor formed the first line with their great horses without mains or hair or ears, and with a silver horn in the middle of their foreheads to make them look like rhinoceros. Between their squadrons, young men wearing small helmets weighed an ashwood spear in each hand. I love that weight. You can see them like kind of bouncing it on their hand when he says that, you know, the long pikes of the heavy infantry brought up the rear. All these merchants that collected on their persons as many weapons as possible. Some of them could be seen carrying simultaneously a lance and axe, a club, two swords, others like porcupines bristled with darts and their arms stuck out of their breastplates in sheets of horn or iron plates. So cool. Last appeared the structures of the tall machines. Now I'm not sure how to pronounce this actually. Carobaleeste, Carobaleeste, Molinegers, catapults and scorpions, swaying about on wagons drawn by mules and ox teams. And as the army deployed, the captains ran, panting from right and left to pass on orders, close up ranks and keep intervals. Those of the elders who were in command had come with purple helmets whose magnificent fringes caught in the straps of their boots. Their faces dogged with vermilion shown beneath huge helmets top by gods. And as their shields had ivory rims covered in precious stones, they looked like sons passing above bronze walls. That's some amazing writing with action. It is pretty good at describing the way battles can turn. Someone seems to be winning. Yes. It turns out they've made a mistake, they've over committed and they lose. Can I read a little battle scene here? Okay. So picking up mid-battle, the barbarians had leaped outside defenses. They were face to face at Javelin range. A belleric slinger took a step forward, put one of his clay shot in his sling, swung his arm, an ivory shield shattered and the two armies clashed. The Greeks pricking the horses' mussels with the points of their lances made them fall over on their masters. So you can see the Greeks there were I mean, pricking the horses' mussels with the points of their pain. Yes, pain as a battle tactic. Yes. The slaves who were meant to throw stones had chosen excessively large ones which fell down near them. The Punic infantrymen laying about them with their swords uncovered their right flank. The barbarians broke through their lines, slaughtered them with their swords. They tripped over the dying in the dead, blinded by the blood spurting from their faces. This heap of pikes, helmets, breastplate swords and confused limbs turned on itself, expanding and contracting elastically. This is so beautiful. More and more gaps grew in the Carthaginian cohorts. Their machines became stuck in the sand. Finally, the Sufets litter, his great litter with its crystal pendants, which have been visible from the start rocking among the soldiers like a ship at sea suddenly sank from sight. No doubt he was dead. The barbarians were suddenly alone. It's so, it's just like, it's probably even, I don't know, I hope it sounds as sort of awe-inspiring as it reads when you read it. There are so many species of human and soldier in this thing. Yet it all is piled up into a sort of funeral pyre and then burned because Carthage in the plot of the novel wins the war against the mercenaries in that they die. Thousands of them die trapped in a box canyon into which the Carthaginians let all the lions they can find. And so a lot of these guys are against those who aren't eaten, die of thirst. There's incredible suffering. But Carthage itself is weakened by this war. And in the background is Rome, which has none of this dissension and none of this grotesque re as far as we can tell in the novel and is undoubtedly going to win. And the final act of the novel and it's told really, really quickly is the death of Salambo, spoiler alert, I guess. She's finally married off to Nair Havas, the Numidian king who allies with Carthage in return for a promise that he can marry her. And she's poisoned for the loss of the Zymph of sacred garment of the goddess, Tonit. Oddly enough, I found a lot of critical studies that say she dies of shock. Although it seems pretty clear to me that Carthage has poisoned her in this final act of betrayal. She drinks from a cup, then she dies. Yeah, colombol. They did it. So everything at the end is erased, all this suffering. But there's a kind of sadomasochistic magnificence about it that can make people very uncomfortable. But it's going to stick in your memory if you read this thing forever. And another thing I was wondering about is like, why did Flowbear write this? And I mean, I think you brought up something that might reflect part of it. Like, okay, I'm not allowed to talk bad about middle-class France because he was put on trial for immorality. He got off, but it wasn't a pleasant experience. Yeah. So all right. Yeah, it sounds very romantic and cool, you know, much later. But it was probably, I don't think he was like a model of health. No. It would be having to deal with lawyers and convictions and trials. I mean, it would have an effect on you. Yeah. So I mean, I've always wondered when I read this novel. I mean, and it's a problem for all 19th century French novels. What do you do with France? France had the world in its hand and lost it. France own most of the world that mattered at the beginning of the 19th century. It's now 60 years later, and France is a very distant second and is very much aware of itself as being a very distant second to Britain. And you got to wonder if, you know, there's something French about Carthage because there's something implacable about the Romans. There's very much like the French image of Britain as something cruel and united always in lockstep and unbeatable, really. I mean, he says at one point, Carthage was wanting in political genius. Her eternal anxiety for gain prevented her from having the prudence which results from loftier ambitions. A galley anchored on the Libyan sands like Carthage is a galley anchored on the Libyan sands. It was with toil that she maintained her position. The nation's roared like billows around her and the slightest storm shook this formidable machine. And, you know, there's a price to pay for being realistic. I mean, when I went to Russia, I was struck by this. Like, Russians have a much more realistic picture of the world or had one in the Yeltsin era than Americans did during the Clinton era. But there's a price for that. No, I think that's a great point. I think you made it last time maybe as well that the whole picture of decadence was something felt pretty deeply in France at the time. And so Carthage for them was a story of for for for a bear. I guess. And maybe for the audience, perhaps that's why they did take to it. Yeah. If that's what you're saying, because it was, I don't know, it was a way they could sort of look at decadence without directly addressing it about themselves, and it doesn't seem to have hurt them as much as Emma Bovery having sex in a moving carriage. Because they're loser husbands running running behind them. That was like the moment where France lost its mind. I sometimes wonder if it's if what hurt more was I mean, they they went after it over this the sexy and I guess in the adultery. But it's the picture of Charles who is every French man. It is not a flattering picture of every French man. And he's like Jerry Lundergaard of although at least Jerry got something done. But I mean, he was a boy. It's really he's a painful person to follow. But they couldn't say that. So they went after the lack of Emma's virtue, I guess. But I think maybe there's also a writer's desire to also sort of if you I don't know how I know that he was a kind of famously slow writer and he went over. He made sure every word counted. And I think Madam Bovery being his first book. I think he went through several drafts. In fact, if I remember right from Michael Bernstein's lectures, you know, how many decades ago. The early versions when he was working on it were almost the sort of cliched sentimental novel that he winds up completely parroting it as he goes through more and more drafts. Yeah. That it was it was sort of the bad, you know, fallen woman romantic sentimental novel that he winds up savaging by the final draft. And I wonder if after all that, he just sort of like, fuck these people. I want to write about something far away. Totally different. Because like the last thing you would say about these people is that their lives are I'm saying the characters in solemn, but you wouldn't say that they led these meaningless petty lives, you know, that are totally uninteresting and dull and drab and familiar. I mean, they're insane. They're alien and, you know, epic as the kids say. Yeah. And I could understand that. And I one thing I read somewhere that Flobar's first draft that he had spent a year working on before he visited Tunisia Tunis, you know, Carthage and I think some other parts of North Africa. He had a draft version that he was working on. He's really into it. And then he went and visited and saw and smelled and sort of reinterpreted, I guess, Polybius and other stuff that he was reading after actually seeing it, seeing what the light was like, seeing things for real. And he wrote to somebody and he said, I've got it all wrong. And he completely rewrote the whole novel, which is really interesting. Very good point because that's essentially what Nietzsche and the new German classical scholars were doing. Like, wow, we've been reading this, these classical texts as if there were sources of quotes on the good life. And in fact, there this psycho tribe from the Aegean with its very strange village superstitions and rites. And it has to be totally reconsidered. But yeah, there's a feeling in this that you, as Nietzsche kept saying, you have to accept suffering. And I think the weirdest slow bear effect I ever had with that was reading sentimental education, like yes, I thought sentimental education was going to be a great novel because I'd heard it described as the corrosive lives of these pulp journalists. And then you read the first few chapters and it's a very operatic love story about love on a boat. This dumb kid sees this woman on a boat going down a river and is like, oh, I'm all infatuated now. Then the rest of the novel is like, yeah, and he could have been somebody and he threw it all away. But nothing to do with her. It's just like a different story that comes in. So there's something about those operatic dreams and magnificent staging in solombo linked to a feeling of decay and waste. Well, anyway, just sum it all up. We highly recommend reading it. And it's not a it's not a fun novel to read because it because it's not it doesn't have any of that grim humor. And it's just very pitiless. But it is, I mean, I really think Lamon was right. In fact, I had that opinion. I was so surprised when I asked him. I didn't expect him to say that about solombo because I it's I wouldn't even say solombo is my favorite novel even by a stretch. But it just if you had to kind of put your finger on something the closest to a perfect novel. It's I think that's it. At least that was definitely what I thought way back when when I was you know, really going through all the great novels and stuff. This is as close to kind of a perfectly nothing extraneous novel as I've read. It's funny because it it seemed to excite a lot of Mussolotsky a lot of people in other arts. He can pose an opera for this every single artist of the 19th century went to town on solombo to the point that there's there's an embarrassment of riches when they have to come up with a new cover for it. It's like, yeah, there's a million of what do we got in this that's not copyright. And then the French late 20th century artist Duyet came up with a whole novel of it which is not bad in a Geiger kind of version of solombo. But yeah, maybe because the graphic arts aren't as moralized as literature. All right. So if any of you all have read solombo as well, I mean, be curious what other people think about it and compare to other flowbeir novels. I mean, it's funny. I remember it's funny that you mentioned sentimental education because I have to admit I don't remember hardly a thing from it except that except how totally bleak it was almost like the whole novel was kind of a joke at the end. The joke was nothing happens and their lives go nowhere. As sort of how I remember it. But I didn't even I really didn't remember any of the scenes at all whereas solombo made a strong impression. Yeah. Again, even though I wouldn't say it's anywhere near my favorite novel. But it's just great. I don't know. I can't think of another novel that made an impression like that on me. Well, I mean, for me, I nearly flunked out of high school and I was in bad shape. And I heard a lot of talk about wasted potential. And then I read sentimental education and it's like, oh god. This is the eternal pattern. It's nothing but wasted potential. And in a sense, you know, solombo as we said is about waste. But it's it's it's such a beautiful waste. I again, just one last point about because we keep asking why did he write it, you know, and I have I do have this theory and I've seen there are some artists who kind of do this where you go from where you need to get away from what you just did. So you go into something that is kind of seems like almost the opposite. So, so, you know, you go from contemporary small town middle class France to, you know, ancient Carthage and this grand brutal love story. And then I think the next not yeah, the next novel sentimental education, which is more of a Madame Bovary-esque, I guess, you know, in terms of being contemporary and cr\u00e8me. And then I think the next one after that, which I don't remember as it was the temptation of St. Anthony. Yeah, too many animals get killed. I couldn't handle it. Isn't it sort of written like a screenplay a bit? You know, like, I mean, obviously there were screenplays, but like a play. And then the one after that, which I think was published maybe even postumously is Bouvard Becouche, which is actually genuinely quite funny. It's just sort of, I wouldn't call it, it's like it's just a comedy. These two guys who are having fun being idiots, you know. Yeah, it was very interesting and stupidity. Yeah. I think that made it hard to read. Yeah. I mean, there's a dog that they're going to dissect in Bouvard Becouche, that's where I quit. Yeah, I see where this is going. I remember what happened to the hunchback. Adam Boveray. Yeah. Okay. Bye-bye. Good. Yeah. Right. Anyway, so I think we take a quick break and come back and just don't want to say a few words about the Jack Tishetta story. So I said I wanted to just say a couple words about Jack Tishetta. I'm never going to get his name pronounced exactly right, even if he yelled it in front of my face, that's how it is. Only because everybody, and I mean everybody seems to basically, in one way or never seems to think he deserves it. Maybe he does. I'm not saying he doesn't, but I want to put it into a little context like there was a lot of, even with people maybe who thought the leaks were not themselves such a bad thing, they thought he was a, I mean, he is a dumb shit. There's no doubt. But because he's a dumb shit, because he did it for what seemed to be such petty reasons, which is to boost his like social capital, you know, his online social capital, social media capital with his discord friends. That's why he leaked these secrets to basically just come off as cool to kids. That therefore he deserved, you know, this pretty serious like manhunt and the New York Times and Bellingcat outing him or at least trying to claim that they found him just before the FBI did. And then you have this, you know, clearly leaked to the press, okay, we're going to stage this big traumatic raid. So the press was up there and the helicopter basically like black helicopters land. And you know, all these armed FBI photos of troops and full armor, putting them in an armor truck. Yeah. For doing basic, you know, roughly similar crime to what Patreus did. Remember, Patreus brought home illegally a bunch of classified documents that gave him to this pretty graduate student that he wanted to bed and he did. He had a big affair with her, right? And he was impressing her. He was giving her classified documents to impress her. And, you know, they didn't go after him like that. They didn't have Bellingcat, you know, hunting down Patreus, right? Because they were probably taking leaks from him at the same time. But, and he didn't get as far as I know, they maybe were considering charging Patreus with the espionage act. But it went nowhere beyond like, should we or shouldn't wait now, obviously we shouldn't. So they charge him, I think instead with a lesser crime, I think it's a misdemeanor. It was a misdemeanor until Trump stiffened the penalties. It's like section 1924 of mishandling or removing classified documents. But it just kind of got me as I was kind of going again, I used to write about a decade ago. I was writing a lot about, I don't know, the secrecy. It was a big topic back then, 10 years ago. Secrecy, censorship, you know, a lot of people were very critical of Obama who famously sort of launched a war on leakers and charged more people with for leaking than any president. And even though he was sort of voted in saying that we're going to have all sorts of protections for whistleblowers and then he went after them. And of course, this is the time of Assange and Chelsea Manning and Snowden, most famously. So I kind of went back through some of my old articles again and looked at this. And then I just start thinking again, okay, you know, are his leaks illegal and why are they illegal? Why do we think it's illegal? You know, there was no crime about, there was no crime about leaking to the American press or to Americans. I mean, you know, the press now, of course, is also a more fluid definition because the press used to be institutions. Now the press can be social media, which could be a discord chat room. I mean, I guess you wouldn't call that the press, but it's media. It is a forum in which, you know, people exchange information. But is that is leaking to a discord chat room, some dorks there, a greater danger than leaking something to the New York Times? I mean, I mean, obviously, no, but of course, there's the danger that it gets out. And then there's the other question out like, why do people leak? Why do government officials leak as a general rule? So we say, okay, well, this guy deserves it because he had such stupid reasons for leaking. So why do people usually leak? I mean, we have this idea of the noble leaker, although it always gets a little weird, you know, the noble leaker who sees something wrong, the government doing something wrong, goes to the press because we're in a democracy to try to call attention to it is not out to hurt, you know, to help enemies and hurt the government, but actually to improve the system. But actually, most leakers, most leakers, John, what do you think, I don't know, what do you think they leak for? I have an idea. I don't know. Well, revenge. Yeah. Revenge or to help their careers, you cultivate journalists by leaking to them, they get stories, then they give you good press, then you move up in the world. Revenge definitely is a big one. Also controlled leaks. Yeah, I mean, when you're talking about the New York Times, just taking them as an example of mainstream media, these are long, long relationships that they have with all the government agencies. And presumably, for a long time, it was a roughly symbiotic relationship for those groups, maybe not for the polity in the larger sense, but for them. So you have an administration that looks weak, you leak something that makes them seem warlike, you have an administration that's too cruel, you leak something about some secret active charity somebody did. I mean, it's exactly. So, you know, there was a study in the 1980s. So, the whole kind of modern secrecy and censorship regime, which includes forcing millions of government employees to sign NDAs, non-disclosure agreements under penalty of criminal penalties, statues, espionage act, and removing or mishandling classified, basically a couple of laws that usually people get charged with. So, that all started under Reagan. Like, very few people, I think only a few people in the CIA up until the 80s, certainly the 70s, and definitely by the 80s, only a handful, every even signed, you know, non-disclosure agreements. And no one was even sure until the 70s if a non-disclosure agreement in the US would hold up because it was a question of sort of contract law versus first amendment law. The whole idea of government information or secrets, who owns them? Like, how can you be charged, for example, of stealing a government secret? I mean, this is kind of more abstract, but this would have been an issue if it had been, this might have been an issue if it had been litigated, but it was litigated differently in the 70s, so precedent was set. But government information, so who owns government information, one, or republic, or government secrets, let's say, and a republic who owns the government, the people. So, how can the people steal secrets from the people? I mean, it sounds like, you know, just a wanky exercise, but it is actually, it's a constitutional sort of question. Whereas, for example, in Britain, they don't really have that, they have the official Secrecy's Act, which was passed in the beginning of the 1900s, and the idea is all information, everything in the government is owned by the Crown. And so Charles, Charles, the, you know, the man who dreamed of being a tampon, owns all secrets. So, if you steal, Charles the Third, I can't get used to that. Like, Charles the Second was plenty to stop there. I know they haven't had too much luck with the Charles, but so the idea there, it's kind of cut and dry. You're stealing Charles's secrets. It's a theft. It's a crime. They can get you for it. But here, that, that precedent wasn't really set until the 70s. And in fact, I'll get into this in a second, but the, the whole modern national security classification system was just created, it was created by a Truman executive order, 10290 in 1951. And it says, you know, spells out what should be classified, what it means to be classified, what top secret is, what secret is. It kind of, it's, it's the framework for the whole thing. So the whole idea that they're classified, at least in the modern sense, classified documents, begins only in 1951. And the SBN Aj Act, which is used to prosecute leakers, including Teixeira. You know, it's, it's been, I think they've charged Snowden with it. You know, they tried charging Ellsberg with it. Basically, all the, I think though there've been only something like 11 or 12 convictions or charges or convictions of government officials who've leaked to the press under the SBN Aj Act. And about half of those were under Obama. It's very rare, actually. And this is what Teixeira is being charged with. The SBN Aj Act was passed in 1917 by Wilson when he went, you know, full wartime. He was a bad president, I think, as we've talked about, especially his second term. He was among the very worst. It went along with this edition act, which was used to charge, you know, actual press with sedition as a crime if you were publishing the wrong, you know, wrong story that was undermining the war effort. That got repealed pretty quickly after his presidency, the sedition act part of it. But the SBN Aj Act stayed. And then later wound up being used to prosecute leakers. And according to most people, the first, and in most sort of accounts, the first person to have ever been charged with under the SBN Aj Act, with leaking to the press, was a Reagan era, Department of Defense, a Naval Intelligence Analyst named Samuel Morrison. He was the grandson. His grandfather was also Samuel Elliott Morrison. He was apparently very famous in his day. He was a Navy rear admiral, but he was much more famous as a historian. I mean, I think he's got like, you know, official monuments to him. And the son didn't, didn't quite live up to the granddad. And apparently, but he was, you know, schooled in all these top schools. And he was bitter and felt, you know, underappreciated. And it's the usual kind of story. And yes, yes, revenge on the world. Here we go. And, and here's where the Warner part comes in. In the early 80s, he started also moon lighting and his boss knew for James Defense, which they had a they had a, I think they don't have like specialized magazines, right? So they had one that is fighting ships. I don't know if you remember. James defense fighting ships. So he just magazines, but gigantic reference. Exactly. That's what he was. Yeah. And then James launched James Defense Weekly, you know, which is one of the Warner Bibles in 1984. That specific magazine was launched in 1984. And Morrison was tapped to be the American editor of it. And he was getting increasingly bitter. He was known to be arrogant and eccentric was one of the words is defensive. He decided to take some classified photos that he got. There's these classified photos taken by K-11 spy satellite, which is pretty cutting into the time of this massive new Soviet carrier that was in a harbor. It was like a thousand foot long aircraft carrier. And it was basically just a cool photos. I mean, it's really hard to understand what Morrison's, well, maybe it's not so hard. What is motive is here. But so he takes some of these photos and he cuts out the secret part because everything was like in printed out or form cuts out secret. Doesn't use gloves puts it into an envelope and mails it to his editor. And you got to assume that he somehow said, Hey, somebody told me that, you know, like there's no way he didn't try to get. Take some credit for it because James is like, wow, this is amazing. He didn't, and Morrison didn't say this is him. They put it on the cover photo. I mean, they like the first several issues of James defense weekly featured various photos that he had anonymously mailed to them. And then the New York Times and Washington Post got wind of it and they started running these photos. And then Morrison's boss and the DOD and Navy Intelligence sought and thought, this is one of the 15 guys that worked for me because this is the only people that would see this. And so yeah, and so then they brought in the FBI. And this was right after Reagan, well, it was really Bill Casey. I mean, Reagan is sort of the metonym here, but Bill Casey, the CIA chief, who was a lawyer by training who really set up this apparatus. And he had an underling helping to kind of create this new secrecy apparatus to go after leakers. And they had a sort of new, they had a national directive to that they wanted to test. And they thought this is a perfect test for a new war on leakers because all of these Reagan people were just like eternally spooked for decades by the experience of the late 60s and the 70s when there were hippies in the campuses and everybody leaking. And you know, they just they were fighting those demons for decades after that, right? And so they decided to make an example of this guy. They charge him with the espionage act. And it's the first it's known as the first successful conviction of a government leaker to the press under the espionage act. And he's convicted in 1985. He's kind of abandoned by most people because he's not a very pleasant guy. And they can't really see it's not like, you know, Ellsberg again has kind of created the template for the the good leaker. Yes, Ellsberg is the template. When you when you said people have this idea of the idealized leaker, yeah, he was the one I thought of. And he still is. And you know, but even he has, I mean, he's a really interesting guy. But it's a it's a it's a strange story too. I don't I don't like there are people who see the strangeness and start thinking maybe the whole story is the opposite and get overly conspiratorial. I don't see it that way. But it is strange that he was he was a marines intelligence guy. And he was Edward Lansdale's who we've talked about. Edward Lansdale, the C.A. guy who famously like, you know, hung up rebels in the Philippines and polls in their next to make it look like a guy. Yeah, he's a very dark guy. He was Lansdale's favorite most and he adored Lansdale. Lansdale was his mentor. And you know, it's and he killed a lot of people. I mean, he was known as a killer in Vietnam. But he also people change, you know, they do change and cultures change. And so but anyway, so he's kind of held up everyone since them has been kind of Jesus like the way Ellsberg was because Ellsberg when he leaked the Pentagon papers, he said, I knew I was going to jail for life. And he expected to, but he thought it was so important to get it out there that the government knew all along that they were lying about the Vietnam war. And he was charged with espionage act. But the it was thrown out because Nixon was such a loon, you know, hired all these loon balls, Howard Hunt and G. Gordon, and then stuff to go like breaking into his psychiatrist and Ellsberg said, you know, and they were like so sloppy about it. And so the whole case was tainted. And so that he got off, he got lucky in a sense. So this guy winds up being the first person successfully convicted. And you know, it's interesting is but but he's not, you know, they kept asking at the time. It's like they were trying the press, I mean, the establishment in 1984 and 85, they were, they were sort of trying to decide how to mentally handle this case. Because on the one hand, it's like, well, here's a guy who leaked to the press. Do we really want to support the Reagan government's war on leakers to the press? And that felt wrong. But on the other hand, he was not a likable guy. There was no noble motive that anybody could see. He was, right? So back just looking at some quotes from him, he was a classic 1980s right wing warner. He probably listened to us. He was in the news. It's like a link these photos supposedly because the public should be aware of what was going on on the other side, meaning the Russians. Yeah. Because if they did, they would increase the defense budget. I mean, I remember the black hundreds in the late Tsarist era exhorting the Tsar to be more Tsarry. Yes. Come on. Get more bloodthirsty. What's wrong with you? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and I think even in that case, he was probably constructing the closest version that in his little mind, he could think of to a noble cause. Because I just think he did it just to be like, look, I have access to this cool photos. And I work for this really cool war magazine. And I wish I could take credit for it somehow, but I got to get it to them. And maybe later, I'll say, yeah, that was me. Well, that brings a very close to Tsar about that. Exactly. That's right. Yeah. Because it's hard. Yeah, it's really hard to understand it. But nevertheless, after he was convicted, then the press and the establishment got kind of weirded out by it. Like, wow, now government leakers to the press can be convicted. And there were times when Casey was threatening different newspapers, editors, and journalists, including Seymour Hirsch, with prison for going public with different stories. And it was all woofing in a sense, but it wasn't empty woofing because now you've shown you can get a leaker in jail under the espionage act. Maybe now you can get the other side in jail too. And one of one of the sort of the sleazy deals that that the media kind of cut with the national security state and it kind of started in the 70s when George Bush senior was briefly C.I. Chief was when they were kind of starting to hash out, like, look, all these leaks are starting to happen. And the press has its job and the national security state has its needs. So let's kind of just generally agree that, okay, the leakers, yeah, they can go to jail, but the press, you can't touch the press. The press is, and they kind of started, and that's sort of been the template ever since, even though there have been half-art attempts every now and then to cross that barrier, which they have crossed with Assange. They've crossed that where Assange, well, he's not the established, he's not an institutional press. He's not American. And he's not American, which is so weird to charge a non-American with the espionage act. And it's bad, it's really bad. Anyway, what's interesting is in 2001, Bill Clinton issued a pardon for Morrison, pardon's it. Why? Why would he care? And then I think it's Anthony Lewis, who one of those funny-duty New York Times columnists comes out and praises Clinton to the skies and said this up to that time, he was still the only government leaker convicted of the espionage act of a crime. And it was really important for the press. And this is early 2001. And for democracy, this is how it was sort of taken at the time that he be pardoned so that we can sort of restore something taken away from us by Reagan, which was convicting government officials of leaking classified documents to the press. So you see, like, I think people now just, it's very deeply ingrained in people, oh, you leak, you go to jail if they decide. We know there's not, it's not fair, but we kind of assume that certainly at the elite level, everybody assumes, no, we're going after you. But it wasn't, it wasn't a precedent until really, it wasn't a precedent really set in stone precedent until Obama pretty much. I mean, Bush started ramping up leak convictions, but it was really under Obama that it went to a new level. Well, there was so much sympathy for Obama as if I know he was up against this unstoppable right wing machine. And therefore he had to do a few regrettable right wings things. Yes. But we don't want to add to his troubles by giving him a hard time about it. Yeah. So Morrison, you know, he was convicted, he played guilty eventually as force to plead guilty. He got, oh, no, he didn't plead guilty. I'm sorry. In that case, he fought it in 1985 case. He fought it all the way up to the Supreme Court and it was upheld. And I think that's what kind of freaked people out. So it was like said in precedent in stone, and the pardoning maybe, maybe was going to hopefully reset things and then, you know, then war and terror. And that's all out the window. And another strange thing about Morrison in 2014, in his old, old age, he was caught and convicted of stealing government property again. He went into the old records of the Navy because he wanted memorabilia or documents or whatever on his famous grandfather and just stole it. Brought it home to me. He was, he was caught convicted, pled guilty, two years probation and died. So yeah, and it turns out when I was looking at this, that there was actually a case before of a government official who leaked to the press, who was caught and charged, but convicted of a lesser crime. It's a weird story. So this is 1957 and it's totally forgotten. Like whenever you see anybody doing the history of government leakers who've leaked classified information and here's, you know, the Reuters story or the New York, here's the timeline. It always starts with Samuel Morrison in 1985, but actually it's a very forgotten story that I found. It was in 1957. It was an army colonel named John Nickerson and what happened was he was supervising an earlier version of the Jupiter missile program out in Alabama. And there was a kind of one of those services wars as they constantly have over budgets and weapon systems and so on. And the army wanted to have control. But the army basically said that the Jupiter should be ours. We consider missiles a long range artillery. And so we need to develop this Jupiter ICBM. And the Navy said no, missiles are pilotless planes. They should be ours and we're developing the Thor and the Thor is going to be the missile system. And so in 1956, Eisenhower's defense secretary sort of issued, you know, came in as a referee and made a decision like who gets what? And he said the army can develop short range missiles and kind of count it essentially under the theory that that's sort of like artillery. And the Navy gets the mid and long range missiles. And so Nickerson, who had been developing, he was sort of the head of this where they were testing and working out the Jupiter in Alabama. He was absolutely furious. He went and complained to the DOD and that went nowhere. The decision was made. So he decided to he types up a 12-page anonymous screen attacking the decision. He says it's you know, it's going to put army troops in danger that you know, if it's there's corruption involved, something to do with general motors. You know, that the army must have this. Whoever's anybody who's in favor of what this defense secretary decided is basically helping the Soviet Union and helping communism. And then in this 12-page document, he also revealed that the Jupiter actually can go much further than it was then it was initially believed because it was developing so well. It can go 3,000 miles while the Thor that the Navy had could only go three feet or the Thor wasn't working. And anyway, so one of the people he leaked this to was Drew Pearson. If you remember, it was Mary Gooround column. It's where Jack Anderson wound up taking it over. It was like the leading column syndicated all over America that people leaked stories to. So but Pearson always was out to protect himself. He was a pro. So he goes to his contact in the Department of Defense and says, I'm going to run something about this. But I just want to make sure I'm not, you know, it's okay. This is what six years after Truman issued this directive about, you know, setting up this whole idea of classified documents. Anyway, the DOD took it from and said, no, you absolutely can't run it. We'll be angry. And then they took it for themselves and were able to pretty quickly figure out that it was Nick or Senu wrote it. And they did a raid on his home kind of to share like and charged him with under the espionage act and mishandling classified documents and so on. And anyway, he has there's a whole trial and people like Von Braun appears witnesses and everybody basically says as they did even in Morrison's trial, like when Morrison had a trial, everybody had to admit, well, he didn't reveal anything because the New York Times and Washington Post had already written all kinds of articles about this K-11 spy satellite. Like all that was already out there, but that wasn't the point. The point was if you if you leak classified documents unauthorized, you must be punished. And this is kind of the case with Nickerson. So Nickerson had revealed a secret that they thought was pretty important that should not have been leaked, which is that the Jupiter can go 3,000 miles. The Thor can't go anywhere. And that was not something they wanted out there. But Von Braun and some of these other people said everybody already knows all this stuff. And definitely the Russians too. In any event, Nickerson wound up, so they wound up getting the espionage act charges thrown out. Most of the charges thrown out. And in the end, he was just fine $1,500. He was given an official reprimand. He was forbidden from exercising command for a year. And so it was almost like an acquittal. But for Nickerson, it was absolutely devastating. He wanted to like he wanted to give a big defense of his actions and say, did it for patriotic reasons? His attorney said, don't do it because that'll just destroy you. Actually, a lot of that's that was the same with Morrison. Morrison's attorneys, they asked him, why didn't you put him on the stand and let him speak for himself? He said, if you ever heard this guy talk, he played him. He was his own attorney from the ACLU. So anyway, and so Nickerson, he was a guy who was going to it was like on the verge of being promoted to Brigadier General instead. He was exiled to an army base in Panama, where he became an inspector of local construction work. And a couple years later, he died in a car crash in New Mexico. So yeah, it didn't didn't work out well. 10 years later, 1967, Ram Parts magazine, Warren Hinkel's magazine, the famous magazine. It did these two sensational expos\u00e9s on secret CIA programs, where the CIA was running the National Students Association, which back then in the Cold War era was this millions strong kind of international student association. And they'd kind of have student offs, you know, like with the Europeans and with communists and try and show how great Americans were. And this is where I think Gloria Steinem kind of infiltrated the NSA for the CIA. That's I think was one of her things for the CIA. And when Ram Parts exposed it, it was a huge deal. And they also exposed some Michigan state program where under the guise of some academic economics program, they were actually running like police and torture training. And the guys who leaked those programs, they didn't they hadn't signed any secrecy agreements. They had like they were able to to leak these programs without fear of being charged under the espionage act. And those, you know, those were major stories. And the leakers didn't have that fear of going to jail. So, you know, that stuff came later. Yeah. Just one last couple of last ones here. They're just because they're interesting. Right. In 1970, Christopher Pyle, who I interviewed, he was a US Army military intelligence officer, but and also like a Columbia law school grad. I think it was Columbia law school. He, as he got, I mean, you know, he had to serve. So he served in military intelligence in Georgia. And as he kind of rose up the ranks during his term of service, he started finding out about all these domestic spying programs that the US Army was conducting in the US that should have been illegal. And so he went public with it in 1970. And started publishing articles and then gave more material to other press. And so it went up getting, you know, published a lot of places. And he went to work for Sam Irvin, the senator who later led the Watergate hearings to expose this. And it turned out that between 1967 and 1970, every single protest demonstration in America that had 20 or more people had at least one plain clothes undercover US Army infiltrator. Isn't that insane? Yeah. It's so insane. And they were so shocked. And they were so shocked by this. And so they tried to pass some laws. Irvin, who was able to get a president out could not get a law passed. It just they got blocked every which way, whether by other senators, whether by courts, they couldn't get a law passed out law. It is really incredible. I know. That's that's that's a lot of labor. Why isn't it? Isn't it? A lot of salaries. It is. I mean, you know, I guess they had the draft back then so they could just put any dumbass to work. And you know, who knows if it was like hair or where half of them wound up smoking pot and going off at the hippies. I should do another protest, sir. I really want to. You know, is that the plot of hair? Because I know you saw that when you were a kid. Yeah. Well, there's the movie. I saw the play as a kid, which was a probably, you know, I don't know. My parents took me to one of those like six. And I just remember a bunch of hit, really hairy hippies going under a big parachute. And then when they lifted the parachute up, they were all butt naked and hairy. And I was just like, oh, this is a bit strange. Something else. Yeah. Oh, Lordy. And then there was a movie and the movie was sort of, yeah, about a, a Vietnam, somebody who was either sent off to Vietnam and came back or he was supposed to go off to Vietnam. He winds up falling in with a bunch of hippies and they kind of try and rescue and save him. And I can't remember it. It was a long, long time ago. And he winds up like really liking the hippies and the hippies really like him. And, oh, yeah, which would be more fun. Go off with the hippies. Exactly. Two military intelligence for panic Georgia. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, just one more leak story here because I just wanted to talk about leaks. You know, you had the Pentagon papers and at the same time, Jack Anderson, this is how one time famous Jack Anderson got his Pulitzer. He was publishing these, this series one after another. These incredibly sensational stories that were like right out from under Nixon and Kissinger's nose, right out from their National Security Council about plans for the Vietnam war, other plans. And in particular, their plans for, well, what Nixon and Kissinger were doing with regards to the Bangladesh War and India and while the India Pakistan War over Bangladesh, which we did a great series on earlier and Radio Warner about the genocide there. And what Kissinger and Nixon were up to was was absolutely malevolent. You know, as malevolent as can be including almost risking nuclear war to protect a genocide. Just one of the most pointless extreme examples of malevolence we've ever studied. So somebody was leaking direct, you know, classified files to Jack Anderson. And that's, I think that was the main reason why Nixon initially set up the plumbers who went up doing the whole Watergate thing was to find out who was doing this. And in fact, when the Pentagon papers came out roughly around the same time, Nixon wasn't even, or Nixon was sort of at first like, yeah, who cares about that? That's something LBJ did. I need to find who's stealing from us right now. And so he wasn't even that outrage for a while until later by the Pentagon papers. And it was really because of what he found out about this that he decided to account. I'm going to go after Elspurgan, the Pentagon papers. What he found out was, well, first they were like, how do we stop Jack Anderson? So he gets the plumbers and Howard Hunt decides to meet with these like weird CIA you know, doctors like like evil doctors. And they're trying to come up, concoct like different poisons or psychedelics they could do some with that would drive them crazy and discredit him. They talked about like arranging a car accident. Howard Hunt was like bragging that they arranged car accidents in Africa. And that successfully killed people without having anybody's fingerprints on it. But eventually then they were also at the same time trying to find out the leaker. And they found out that the leaker was this young navy yeoman, who's a Mormon as was Jack Anderson, who accompanied Henry Kissinger everywhere he went. And literally like in the airplane or wherever he was, he just pop open the briefcase, pull out the classified documents. So they brought him into brow beat him when they realized it was him. And you know, made him give up who was running him because obviously this kid wasn't running the operation. And it turned out the people running him, it was the head of Nixon's joint chiefs of staff Admiral Thomas Moore. Because some of the people on in the joint chiefs of staff were so horrified, both by kind of the moves to get out of Vietnam and by moves to maybe get us into a war against India and the Soviet Union to protect Pakistan's genocide. They thought like this is not, I mean, they made the navy move up there, right, in order to try to scare the Soviets from staying away. They were pissed, they hated Nixon and they really hated Kissinger. So they tasked this yeoman who had access to Kissinger secrets to leak and try to undermine Nixon's policies. And when Nixon found out, I mean, there's a whole bunch of quotes, but there's a couple quotes here I just wanted to say because he was so shocked and so he concluded, I mean, talk about leaks, right? Nixon concluded the entire fair was quote, a federal offense of the highest order, nothing less than a Pentagon espionage system with the military shutting up their own Gestapo and spying on the president. And John Mitchell, the attorney general thought it raised the specter of a military takeover. And Nixon said, if it was a movie, you wouldn't believe it. And they go on, yeah, and then Holderman says it's almost as if they meant to do something. And Nixon said, that's what I fear. And Holderman says the joint chiefs think of that story. So basically, they realize who it is, they freak out and get scared and say, we can't prosecute them for leaking. And so they don't. And you know, what did the what did the military want? They didn't want Nixon to necessarily to pull out of Vietnam. They didn't want Nixon and Kissinger to make some kind of peace deal with China. They thought Kissinger was a communist. A lot of these guys. These guys, I mean, they thought he was like a homosexual Jewish communist who was looking, you know, trying to do detente and do these other things. And then they also didn't want Nixon to suck them into that war in India. Like they just, I don't know, you know, people at that level, I guess everybody thinks they should run the show. Yeah. So, you know, bringing it back from that to to Shara. Like the idea of, I mean, what what have his secrets revealed? The more we're learning about the secrets, the more that we're learning what's been published anyway, I haven't heard anybody make a case that like, this has damaged the US that it has made us more insecure, that it's damaged Ukraine, that it has helped enemies discover methods and means. I mean, think about all the leaks in the beginning of the Ukraine war. Authorize leaks, I'm sure, about how US intelligence has been guiding Ukraine, that we know more about Russia and every move Russia makes before it makes it. We know more about them than we know about Ukraine, if you remember, those articles. Like these leaks have been coming out all along. I think, you know, among the stories that came out that maybe weren't as well known is that Ukraine is not doing as well as the press generally gives the impression. So, okay. So, so basically it's debunking some disinformation that officials have been spreading to us. So, it's basically about us again, as it usually is. Like it's about protecting the government from the US public knowing too much. Well, I mean, given that the guy is a 21 year old national guard. Yeah, I know. It had better be because it, he was involved in foreign intelligence at a high level. Something's wrong with the whole setup of the hierarchy. It's, I mean, yeah, it's hard to know. I mean, as far as I know, I have not seen anybody make that case. Like at first they seem to be making that case that this was really damaging. And these are the most biggest secrets ever revealed or revealed in decades or something. But as time has gone on, you don't hear that at all anymore. You know, so I just, I don't know, I want to bring it back. Like the idea of that government leakers should be frog marched by like a whole army of people and have and go to jail for decades and have their lives ruined. It's a pretty new concept. And it's really mostly a post war on terror concept. Even though Reagan set up the whole system, Bill Casey really set up that system that wound up being used later. It's a concept that really only came to fruition since the war on terror. So it's fair to say, well, any dumb shit shouldn't be allowed to take secret stuff and leak them to his discord group, you know, because why is that why is that good for me? I don't know. Something should happen. Maybe their career should suffer. Should they should they have their lives destroyed? Should they go to jail for a truck? Is it really that big of a crime in a in what's supposed to be a democracy? And the guy, you know, again, he wasn't actually even leaking to the New York Times or publicly. So it wound up going public as he was a dumb shit. He put it somewhere where it could be. But he's not the one that even leaked it publicly. He's leaked it to 10 friends. So I don't know. I just it's a granted. It's hard to feel sorry for the guy. But in terms of like the precedent or the point of it all, it's pretty nasty all around. It's not like it's nothing to celebrate that they caught him and they're going to jail him. It's not funny. It's not. Ha ha ha. You deserved it. It's fucked up. You know, it's very fucked up because it turns out we should know this stuff as with almost all these leaks. We should know it. Well, I think the subtext in a lot of New York Times, Wapos, CNN stories was he betrayed his real mission, which was essentially PR for the military. Right. And what he's done is a lot of PR harm to the military. Right. So he should have his career hurt. Yeah. For that. Like, you know, it makes sense that then he's ruined his career as a military intelligence guy. But, you know, we all know what jail means. What prison, 15 years of prison means. So it's torture. I mean, I don't know how to put it. So 15 years of grim low grade torture like it's, it seems pretty damn extreme. And you know, the point of some, I mean, the whole point of this apparatus that was set up and making millions of people sign this form 312, which commits you to, you know, under penalty of law to not disseminate government classified documents. And again, classification has gone crazy. I mean, there's tens and tens and tens of millions of documents that are classified now because everybody agrees, but no one will do anything about it. That classification has gone completely bonkers, especially since 2001. But yeah, the idea that, that you go to jail for, I mean, you basically your entire life destroyed for it. It doesn't seem like in a, it doesn't seem like the worst crime out there. And it's treated as a crime. Well, at the moment, the center is lined up pretty directly with yes, the military and liberals. Well, yeah, the center left, let's say. And especially because they've got a war going that they want to promote. And if you make it seem like it's not going as well as it's supposed to be going, that's basically considered treasonous for most people in the center of life. I mean, it has to be said again. So he's charged under the SBN Aj Act. And you know, the SBN Aj Act was not written to prosecute leakers. Yeah, everybody agrees on that. But the prosecutors, you know, the government doesn't want to give up that possibility because when you can hold the SBN Aj Act over people, I mean, what a great weapon. You're going to win. You're going to scare the living shit out of anybody. You're just going to win every, every, you know, conviction one way or another because yeah, you can go to jail for life under the SBN Aj Act. That's what they got manning for. That's what they've charged snowden with what they want to charge, what they have charged to sange with. One other thing I forgot to say and then I'll finish this up, that was kind of so it's set precedent in that Samuel Morrison case, the James Defense Weekly nerd leaker in the 80s was when he went to trial, the judge set the sort of the parameters of, you know, as they do in trials, sort of what you can't argue and what you can't argue. And the parameters that he set, which then became precedent for every case since was his interpretation of being charged under the SBN Aj Act was you can't bring into the trial your reasons for leaking. It doesn't matter if your reason was something totally noble like Ellsberg to, you know, to get the truth out about a war and save lives and get the truth to the people to save democracy or because you're a bitter, you know, thwarted nerd who wants to impress, you know, James, to weekly or, you know, or your discord buddies, teen buddies. It doesn't matter. So that's, I mean, that's pretty awful. So that means if, you know, when manning was, manning couldn't bring that up in manning's trial, Assange would not be able to bring that up. His reasons for, you know, handling and leaking classified information in his trials, no one wouldn't be able to. And so it also means that to share a, his reasons, whether it was noble or lame, it's irrelevant. He's being charged with an act where your reasons for doing it are irrelevant. Yeah, so I just think, I just think it sucks, that's it. I'm gonna get that on that happy note. Yeah. On that happy note, free Jack DeShira. Anyway, until next episode. Thanks again, everyone. Thanks everybody. Bye.",
