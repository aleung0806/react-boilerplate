    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. Today is September 26, 2022. This will be episode 348 and the occasion of this episode is the victory of the neo-fascist party in Italy, birthplace of fascism. Anyway, I'm the Coast Mart Games. I'm in Rochester, New York. We've got the Warner AKA John Dolan, AKA Gary Brecher in the south of Italy and John Hyde. You there? I. Okay, good. And of course we have with us today legendary favorite of the show, friend of the show, Ani Belay, who we first got to know in our years of lead series, the years of lead in Italy and gladio and all that stuff. And you know, here we are now in 2022. It's like literally a hundred years since the original fascist march on Rome. And then a neo-fascist party has just been, there's just one parliamentary elections and the neo-fascist leader of this party or quasi neo-fascist, let's say whatever the hell that even means. Leader of the party, Georgia Maloney, who was recently praised by Hillary Clinton, will be, come, it seems, prime minister. So, you know, first of all, I guess the first question. First of all, thanks for coming back on the show Ani Belay and welcome back. Thanks for asking me to come back. He's always a pleasure to chat with you guys. And for us and for our listeners. I mean, we're doing this snap episode because, you know, one way or another it's pretty darn significant. Italy has been an innovator for better and for worse in Western politics, you know, for well over 100 years now. I mean, Italy introduced fascism. Italy and Italian fascists actually first concocted the whole notion of neoliberalism and coined the term neoliberalism. We did an episode on that. I'll post all this later. That was episode 205. You know, Italy, Italy basically created Trumpism before Trump through Berlusconi. Popularism. I mean, a lot of the sort of the post war, well, basically politics of the last 100 years seem to start first in Italy and sometimes make their way, you know, to other countries. So, how significant do you think Maloney's victory is and, you know, and then we'll get into why and who they are and their roots and so on. George Amelone victory is significant but not in the sense that a lot of the press is making it right now. First thing is that yes, there are neo fascists who are voting for fratelli Italy. But fratelli Italy itself is not a neo fascist party. It is a right wing party that is putting together two souls of the Italian right. One is of course the one that we use to identify with the Movimento Succiar italiano. And we're going to talk about the Movimento Succiar italiano in a moment. That's the fascist part just for listeners. Their brand was we are the hair of the Italian fascist party, the part of the neo fascist before the Republic of Succiar italiana. So yes, there are people who at least consider, let's say the classical people who say yes, Mussolini did some right thing. We did something wrong of course, you know, the alliance with Germany was wrong, but it did right thing say it was okay and so on and so forth. This is one side. The other side is the right wing of the leg, the right wing of the for the Italia and in general, the right wing of what user to be the the moment, the Christiana, the moment, if you have followed my series about the evolution of the Italian politics before fascism came to power. And afterwards the moment, the second, the white whale, it was called the white whale, this huge conglomerate of different idea, linked together by a loose Christian legions, probably more than ideology, who add people in, you know, like moral, like people to the left of moral, who were much more to the left than any left wing, so called a left wing party in Italy right now. Okay, you know, I have to say that based on the breakdown of the election stats, I should say first I grew up in the US with the feeling that Europe was a lot further left than the US. Yes. And the left, the fierce left that I thought existed in Europe hardly seems to exist at all in Italian politics. No, it's completely disappeared right now. The left that we had in this election are more to the right than the the the moderate left 40 years ago completely disappeared on the other end. But let's go back to the Italy, the Italy, the Italy. Okay, if I have to single out one element that was the real surprise of these elections is not the victory of George Ameloni. The victory of George Ameloni was, you know, a given, with everybody thought, yes, of course, it's going to be the first party. The most important thing is the defeat of the leg, and for the Italian more the leg than for the leg was gutted completely was the, you know, they they lost. I don't have the percentage right now, but something like one third, yes, they use it to have in 2018. And for the Italian was disappointing. So you have this right wing coalition with one element that in theory quotes big quotes in theory is the hair of the extreme right wing of the first republic. And leg and for the Italian coming together making a extreme a competent let's say a competent campaign unlike what was done by the Partito Democratic or their center left counterpart and we're going to go to the Partito Democratic in a moment and then low and be old. What happens after the ballots are open is that for the Italian wins against the 26% but everyone else inside the same coalition collapses and the leg. I have the figures here. The league went from 18% to less than 9%. It all completely end and I have a sort of inside view of these what happened inside the leg and probably the result of the leg is the single most important element of this. And I have a close well very good friend with someone who is into the top echelon of the leg a few people probably realize these outside Italy but actually the leg is the mix of two different souls to different movements. One is the original leg and the original leg was a technocratic neoliberal very much linked to the idea that Italy, Northern Italy was part of Europe was part of the civilized quotes civilized word and the idea that Northern Italy was the only part of Italy actually working actually producing anything. While the south and the center and the south and part where they were you know welfare queens just like exploiting the turn out of taxes coming from the north. So this idea was we need to cut taxes to have taxes staying inside Northern regions and having political and fiscal autonomy. This was the original leg and then Salvinis leg the new leg is a bit different is more populist is more Italy is Italy and so everybody is Italian and we the leg is actually representing so people from the south. And far more sympathetic toward the populist right wing party like the AFD in Germany or the national front national in France far more interesting to just you know trying to pose as a as a right wing party as a populist right wing party. And what happened is that this second soul that is to be extremely popular in in the last 10 years and is is is the soul of the leg who as you know turn the leg into a power a government party now has been clearly defeated. And there is now the other soul the original soul it just coming back say we you see you see you were wrong we need to turn back into what you said to be the leg so my my my my understanding speaking with the people who are working inside the leg right now is that the original leg a northern oriented leg a movement is will have a big comeback because they yes we we were too much dependent from these lose right wing populist right wing coalition the idea anybody cool associate us with Putin let me cut you off there real quickly because I think you know when we talk about so what you're saying is the leg is returning to its regionalist route so rather than hating foreign immigrants they're now going to hate Southern migrants and you know and the south and the center back to their sort of regionalist show of anism as opposed to nationalist show of anism is that right or am I being crude but one side of the leg right now they don't want to they're not very eager to turn their their brand into we are the people 18 the south they want to turn the brand is we are the people who are really trying to have fiscal justice for the north and an autonomy for the north they are definitely posing because of course the original Roma La Drona Roma the big faith Rome the big faith motto of the leg is it sounds very old fashion right now right now not not like anyone likes Roma the moment by the way Rome turned out to be well turned out confirm it itself to be one of the next the one of the centerpiece of the right in Italy but Rome is one of the centerpiece of the far the I mean the the fascist right in Italy because traditionally they always had an association with that Rome and part of the neapolitan area part of Z and so on right in fact if you check the demography and the distribution of the vote nothing has changed this is amazing for example one in northern Lombardi and and that was about it you know that's it's all the route it's all the home right yes exactly the the the the the the parts that were they were they were born there cheering of course a voted massively voted left Milan voted to PD but it's interesting because Milan user to be one of the the the original seat of for the Italian and the signal is toward Berlusconi of course I mean Berlusconi is clearly senile and the the world campaign he made was ridiculous nobody was really interesting but this sign is that the professional class the professional upper class technocratic link it to Europe and the Litarian everything else that resides in Milan as decided they they are not interesting in that kind of right wing anymore and so they split themselves between the partito democratic and we're going to talk about the partito democratic right now and the calenda reincy so called third pole which is probably the most interesting interesting things that new element of this election let's go back to the right one moment at the moment the right is clearly under the control of meloni but in fact it's not meloni controlling anything because meloni is a sort of mountain of that area but it's not clear who is really controlling that party was really controlling that movement one of the reason why the partito democratic and the left actually did much better than they were supposed to do because the original expectation was terrifying the original expectation was that the right wing collision would have got two third of the seats into the parliament right a super majority that would allow them to change the constitution right exactly which is a big deal in Italy I don't think they would have because of course the external elements but they could have they didn't because as I said fratelli italia won is the first party in Italy but lega and for cittalia lost actually so the the movement of the vote went not from the left to the right went to the semi far right to the far right one of the weirder parties and I know we've talked about this before but for our listeners one of the weirder parties and one of the bigger parties in this election is the five star party and I for me they're very hard to understand what are they about they split too they went to the government in the worst possible moment where covid arrived a conte was the prime minister did up okay job but not outstanding and became a sort of a lightning road for all the a thread all the disappointment all the you know the protest about particularly when the lockdown became way probably way too long for most of Italy to withstand it and it was very strict by the way yes it was very strict very safe full disclosure I think it was okay it was right to do that we saved a lot of life lives particularly in lombardi were the public health system was broken down by all the way of privatization but still I mean I mean a lot of people didn't like it a lot of people thought okay we we should have done differently and conte at some point he did a competent job but he was not outstanding and this made the presence of conte and particularly presence of Luigi di Mayo in the foreign hour for foreign office was very easy for from the left wing from the democratic party despite being in theory in the ally because the government was together I mean there was a collision the political democratic in the leg it became very easy for the majority of the people voting for the political use it to the test the five star movement to start to say you see you see they they were supposed to be the anti-system and they they messed up the whole thing and so as usual I mean it it's an old tune if you are anti-system once you are into the system you normally fail okay but but but but everybody thought she was the five stars were going to be obliterate in this election they weren't yeah that's interesting no and they were there were really popular with voters 18 to 30 or so which I guess it's sort of a screw you vote exactly in theory the younger people was supposed to vote everybody thinks the younger people they are all university students with you know that kind of liberal social justice warrior outlook but there is a lot of people were you know I'm nothing to do with that and well know that once they stop studying they are going to be stuck into delivering food to houses yes gig economy yeah I see a lot of them in southern Italy and I was just looking at the vote in in this area and the right took the right coalition took about 50% of the vote here yes I think it was done really quietly I didn't see a lot of science around tropea not only they were not a lot of science but this was the campaign where the so called the Santino Santino is a I don't know I mean this is something typical of Catholic countries is the face of a saint as more card with a face of a saint a prayer to a saint say they use it to be very popular in Catholic countries decades ago they were called Santino and now the term change it into small cards with the name of candidate and the indication you need to vote this one the word user to be distributed in houses or end to end like you have to imagine like trading cards you know it's that because they're more discrete you can hide them and you think you're safe exactly and they were more personal something like I'm going to give you the Santino they are they still are very popular for local election okay as you know I mean in local elections the distribution of Santini is mandatory this is the first time in my memory I haven't seen just one Santino coming from any party not just the right not just the left for anybody in my my mailbox the physical mailbox not the mailbox yeah for Google email my physical mailbox you used to be overrun by Santini and leaflets I haven't seen one direct mail is what they used to call it yeah so you know talking about the election today there's what it means within Italy and thank God we have you to tell us and to sort of explain to us the nuances of this election and who you know who Meloni is and who the brothers of Italy are and then there are a lot of sort of meta questions that this raises like I mean this is going on obviously in the background of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and that and the war and you know the legga the legga the new version of the legga which apparently got defeated and parts of the five star movement have been accused for one and and Bill is going to be accused of being you know Russian Stooges Putin Stooges controlled by Russia they've flirted with sort of anti NATO or or let's say independent you know they pretended at least to flirt with sort of independent geostrategic or you know foreign affairs and yet what we have correct me if I'm wrong what we have with the so called neo fascist Meloni the the brothers of Italy is an avowately so unlike legga unlike Berlusconi or more than an avowedly pro NATO pro Ukraine yes anti Russia part absolutely how did that happen why is that more popular among voters or is it or is this just there's this almost like another of italy's like you know I mean Italy is just a series of ops you know like dark ops and is this almost like another op to basically destroy the the not loyal enough right wing parties and install a right wing party that is totally loyal to NATO or you know or is that too conspiratorial let's go back to the origin of this crisis we had the draggy Mario Draggy as the you know the leader the premier of of Italy with a clear mandate to keep Italy in line and with the clear support of NATO you everybody you know everybody making sure draggy will become the most popular politician in Italy ever including some I would say quite ridiculous elements like all of sudden in the the months where draggy was running Italy Italy suddenly started to win everything you know win soccer win the lottery the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the everything everything Italy and started to be right working right and we even have the bands winning the euro contest I mean they have this kind of stuff that maybe was legitimate I'm not saying there wasn't a big conspiracy but you know yeah all of sudden it became a bit at least dubious about the the legitimate the most you all of the well draggy had all the biggest friends you would want right I mean I'm not saying whether he was good or bad and you can give your opinion on that but he was the head of the European Central Bank he was a goldman sex guy if I'm not mistaken I mean he was a made man by sort of the Atlantic you know cartel or whatever yes but on the other hand we all know that draggy is not completely aligns you know few few things for instance it's it's it's clear to anybody will take his time to seriously study the subject that when the Greece crisis happen in 2000 I don't remember 12 or like maybe 9 through 12 or 13 or 4 they yes exactly and Germany wanted the Greece to be roasted alive and you know use it as a sort of symbol of what happens with people who is not physically control at draggy was the one who supported the American position it was against the European Union position while supporting the American position say no no sorry we cannot make the whole thing fail because Germany need to make an example of Greece and at some point draggy is is very close to the American elite is much closer to the American elite than is to with you know the bricks or the north western European elite okay and is I mean the last few years is well let's say he's going back to Keynes to to to to to main art Keynes that kind of things you know state intervention it yeah state intervention everything else so he's not the draggy is not you know a one of the Chicago boys he's not on that sort of the left end of neoliberalism basically yeah sort of at very least at very least is you know he understands that reality is one thing right uh subly side or reganomics economics is another one so but he came when he came to power following Conte and following a self an internal coup organized by uh reyensi from by maternity everybody was hoping now yes it's going to transform Italy actually it didn't do anything it just it just went on keeping the the world show running uh smoothly but without changing anything the only thing that he really changes is that at some point he made the uh the the the world lockdown green pass thing the the world controls on uh covid uh being lose and lose and lose in order to you know have the the Italian economy you know to tell me back because at some point nobody could work anymore particularly people who were not uh uh uh uh uh uh enabled to to smart working they they they i mean they were just like if you had a shop at some point you just were you know you were cut off from your shop you just add out of your uh customers and just like prevented from from entering yeah we saw those people marching in uh trentino I think and there yes there was some pathos to it you you had the feeling that a lot of people were really getting hurt yeah oh they were they were absolutely and uh so the right came up with the system to yeah sort of lose it lose nothing the working but beside that the only thing is the is that he managed to control Italy during the Ukrainian crisis and okay I know this is a minority position uh anything I'm going to say is not the radio warner the opinions is any ballast opinion okay but you're identified right now this is all in here okay yes yes is uh you know mark and john are completely against these you know they don't agree well wait till I hear it it sounds bad enough that we might like it I know uh but because the whole thing is that everybody knows well not everybody but you you know the moment put in uh started invasion uh in that moment europe lost okay because we were supposed to Germany particularly Germany yes we're supposed to avoid this because at some point where there was this transition from uh uh angular a Merkel government and center left or whatever it is new government they say to america in particular oh no no we are going to you know you know we're going to make sure don't worry don't worry putty is not going to do anything because we are we are pressuring him we are giving him an impression that he can win uh avoid well the point we all know the point is uh Ukraine enter in NATO and so yeah it's not going to do it and he did it and the moment he did it Europe uh in particular well Germany yes in part France and in part Italy we lost because we enter up like oh you know you were supposed to control this guy and then NATO need to step in and uh at some point just few days before the invasion came there was this rumor that Poland because you know the Polish uh military was really scared at some point they say okay because they're if they're going to invade uh at some point we will need to try to respond particularly if they're going to cross the Nieper and uh NATO had to step in and U.S. had to step in warning uh putting saying don't do that otherwise it's World War 3 starting don't don't cross the Nieper or don't don't cross the Nieper don't go into it because otherwise it is World War 3 and this was a big defeat for Germany because Germany was the one that was supposed to be in control of the right situation on that side it was like being being transported back to 1950 when everything depended on America versus Russia again yes and at this point it it wasn't I got one victory from some people inside NATO and particularly some people inside the U.S. inside the West Pole it's a UC yeah the Atlantic Council were dancing I mean yeah oh they were zooming down the street in their four by fours just waving flags yeah rolling cold yeah because they were just a more say you need NATO yes okay otherwise you're not going you're not autonomous on this on the other side putting doing the invasion and doing this kind of limited invasion uh just to show you could do it just made uh anyone who was sitting on the fence having to choose whatever to do just starting the invasion was a big victory for putting but was put back putting into the position of being someone you have you need you have to take sides or being against putting or being pro putting you could not be neutral anymore in Europe okay and this was a big problem for the Italian politics because a lot of people like Salvini they could on one side get the money from the Atlantic Council because everybody knows that the Italian right wing are always being on the pocket of you know that people but on the other side they could play the overall putting is as well guy with a part of his voters okay he could not do it anymore right you know it's a big change right is a is a gargantuan change and it was of course it did work for meloni uh at the on the other end it worked for meloni because of course meloni is pro NATO West pro because she's comes from that you know that part that weird part of the Italian far right the post fascist Italian far right who instead of being against uh NATO against America against uh we spoke about we talked about us years of lead on one side the real neo fascist the people of the Republic of Social Italian saying oh but we are against Russia but we are so against NATO and on the other side people like uh Unio Valerio Borgese we discussed the Borgese coup right was clearly on the NATO side okay well and and the the scandal about the US ambassador in Rome following hundreds of thousands of dollars to Unio fascist MP Vito Michelli right or Michelli I think right yeah but not only Vito Michelli that I mean or didn't know of all the that most of these people they were into you know they were just getting money for that so meloni does not belong to that faction or she does air or regions is into the movimentos cicelliano and the movimentos cicelliano was clearly pro NATO okay and then she she comes from she comes from the area of the movimentos cicelliano the post moviment because she was she was was born in 1977 so of course when she came to politics movimentos cicelliano disappear but air origins roots come from the the the the pro west the the people who are more likely to to say Pinotce was a great dude rather than Mussolini was a great dude you know yeah this is a question that I wanted to ask you on ebole because sometimes I think in the ang well in the anglozone what were we calling it the anglo sphere we we make a double standard for what is fascist among non-anglo phones and what is fascist among anglo phones like what is the difference between Liz truss and meloni what is the difference between the republican party in the US and meloni well the first thing is that meloni is definitely not as blatantly pro business than these people you know she's meloni is not supposed to come and I don't think she will to come and say okay we're going to completely destroy social security welfare and whatever because this is a one of the tradition coming from you know the original fascism one of the myth related to the Mussolini's fascism that fascist gave is not true but a lot of people think it is true that Mussolini gave retirement to italian italians he gave public national health to italians as on and it's it's it's impossible it's very difficult on that area to come and say okay we're going to slash social security what you can do is to say we're going to stop giving social security to immigrants yes you can do that well yeah that's clearly one of the the uniting themes for the new right in a lot of countries yeah and italy yeah I don't know how many people know this but italy has had massive immigration in a very dramatic way like by sea yes landing in places like lamp edusa or or Sicily or or calabria on tv again and again and again and I a lot of a lot of the tilt to the right I think involves the sort of paralysis when the more respectable centrist politicians have to attempt to talk about this yes but still and this is one of those strange italian paradoxes I will take an example of churren that you know very well because if you've been living in itchurian for a while John churren is probably the one of the places in italy were particularly in some quarter like the northern part of churren when you have been living the presence of the immigrants are in have increased but still and this is the interesting thing churren was supposed to be one of the odd spot of this and so everybody thought okay there's going to be a big turn to the right it these didn't happen the immigrants get resented I've been an immigrant immigrants get resented I I saw this in Saudi particularly because I could speak a little arabic and I could understand some of the things that were being said about me and yeah they may immigrants stand out and they tend to draw resentment but I haven't really seen a lot of that in italy now that maybe because like okay like oligee used to be able to work on these ox bridge dawns because they lived in completely insulated world but what I saw in his film when he went to america for example is that people were media savvy and they were cautious americans are extremely cautious around someone who might put them on film so maybe people down here are just being very cautious but I don't see any obvious manifestations of what would be called xenophobia except for maloney winning I mean isn't that what her victory is pretty much or no well that's what I'm not sure of I mean how does that compare to truss or trump or someone like that yes trump I know absolutely just from years of reading comments the one immovable platform of the people who support trump is immigration you just have to say that word and they're in a rage and I have heard from people in England that it's the same way there because especially because london tends to attract most of the immigrants so they are on the media all the time and everybody thinks that the uk is being overrun with immigrants when really it's it's quite a small percentage of the population so something like that might be going on in italy but but I don't know I'm asking actually I know a few people voted maloney and they told me I voted maloney because she's telling me that the thing as they are as they perceive them but these are not necessarily anything to do with immigrants is more that the social security in italy is falling is that the the the the the entire system like you know public health and taxation and everything else the left at the possibility to change it to fix it and they didn't and she's speaking the way she's speaking simply okay not necessarily she's quite good on her way with words she's speaking simply but she's not the the kind of communication she makes us nothing to do with the kind of you know uh burish and extreme noisy way trump did communicate with his base is she's she's surprisingly quiet on something on the other hand or wherever this is something I really want people listening to this to understand is that I know people would call me I I could vote for maloney but you could never vote for fratellitealia because they are fascist and the fascist thing is still a stigma here and it's still people saying uh I I you have you have a lot of people saying I voted for meloney and she's not fascist because fascism disappeared she's just like one of us and so on but still there are very few people admitting and remember uh there is nowhere the same stigma on fascism in Italy that it it it is in in France or in Germany nowhere near people will will tell you without any problems oh my I had my great uncle or my great father we used to be into the Deci mamassa or into the republic of such a italiana and then I had another one with the partisans it's it's okay it's normal okay it's part of the normal discourse uh but telling people that you are fascist or you are supporting fascism is still something of a stigma and there is people I mean we're talking about completely anti left completely anti communist completely we will say I will never vote for fratellitealia could vote for anybody else I could vote for meloney as a person but they could never vote for fratellitealia because they are fascists I don't vote for fascism okay yeah fascism is still a big deal here so what is her politics I mean so she tells like she sort of is one of these politicians who who's outside the system right her party was the only one of the bigger parties that was not part of this broad coalition government so it wasn't solied by it well I mean how much of this I think you were alluding to this earlier but like how much of this was a rejection of centristism and center leftism and and and droggy's rule because it sounds very familiar what you said you said when droggy was first uh you know did this sort of internal coup and and became the new premier prime minister and had there was a lot of I guess I'm from when I'm hearing from you there was a lot of talk and hope that droggy was the guy who was actually going to reform the system that badly needed reforms it sounds a lot like Biden and what he wound up doing was falling back on the same inertia and not doing much of anything very familiar situation and that opens up a big space for the far right to walk into this does have a lot of resonance and you know significance for a lot of countries a lot of people I mean that that gets to a story that you put on social media a while ago which was this ridiculous article in the New York Times that tried to link uh Lord of the Rings to the rise of supposed fascism in Italy and it's one of the strangest things I've seen about recent political development is that the liberals have become insufferable like I remember Berkeley and I've said this before like it was the left that seemed insufferable but now a lot of leftists seem like really fun, intelligent, reasonable people but the blue checks around the world have become unbearable and there's there's a lot of voting I think that is just a way of saying the hell with you. Yes it's interesting because well the world thing about talking and the right wing in Italy you know there is it's just an Italian specific situation is that in Italy during the 70s actually uh Lord of the Rings was hijacked by the far right because it was published by a far right publisher Rusconi and for a while it became something oh it's fascist and tradition and blah blah blah and then of course it was completely nonsense uh it was sort of rediscovered by the left but all of sudden in the last few weeks you are seeing people from the last left as you say you know posting insufferable stuff saying no no no if you're watching rings of powers on amazon you are right wing you're supposed to watch out of dragons but why are you supposed to watch out of dragons because there is a woman who is uh having a relationship with the dragon something like that and this is against the traditional family and we all know uh the fascist want to enforce the tradition family which is true by the way because in it it was one of the elements of the campaign uh of course it will have no you know right no real uh counterparts in reality but part of the voting population that meloni tried to attract is the people scared about uh you know gay families gay couples getting uh uh welfare and getting the possibility to adopt to people and so on but we all know that this is something that is done in the uh it's part of the propaganda and then yes those are really never transforming to uh or very rarely it transforming to real legislation because you know that that uh another paradox is the fact that there are quite few gay people voting to the right okay i know quite few of them okay we are absolutely not interested on you know gay marriage and so on they are gay they don't want to be persecuted or discriminated for being gay but they still vote on the right because they are you know they they feel like they they need to go in that direction and one just wonder i mean for all the anti uh homosexual politics of the right why anyone with homosexual could vote on the right but still this is something that happens i'm not judging anything yeah well there's a famous quote from meloni uh where she sort of laid this out and i think it's more than the the tone that and you see this around the world uh of defensive pride that that resonates with with some demographic uh groups like here's what she said i am Georgia i am a woman i am a mother i am Italian i am Christian no one will take that away from me i mean the question with all these things is well who who's taken away in the u.s the answer is like uh the public schools you know i don't know it very nice place to place but there you just have to make the statement really and that's supposed to have a magical effect but in Italy of course it's not the public school or whatever nobody will say that but she made this statement because the idea is there is people on the left and of course there were people on the left they are really people on the left at least in Italy we say that being a mother being Christian being uh is uh is not the let's say is not important as important as it used to be okay and of course in Italy what happens is that when she she was quite smart on doing this because making this kind of statement it means that someone was gullible enough on the other side we go on internet say oh no no you're right you're you're saying you're a mother so you're a father supporting the patriarchy dude exactly exactly these of course is you know is just giving anyone on melody side you know a fantastic excuse to say oh you're anti mothers you're anti christian you're anti and so it's you know is a bait and switch tactics that always works but the point let let's go from you know let's let's move from this and let's go into what is the real program yes how fascist or quasi fascist or whatever is it it's not it is a right wing liberal program but without the let's cut the public uh service let's let's cut let's cut the the welfare policy it's not sterile no it's okay we need to have a be physically responsible but being physically responsible doesn't mean we have to cut uh you know national arts service so we need to increase the patience the retirement money uh because this is something that is very important for a lot of the the demographics uh voting for for meloni we need to uh discuss with Europe the world PNRR I don't know if you know what PNR are it is no it's basically uh I will be you know very loose and it is is basically is uh money coming from Europe if you are you know if you agree to stay in two parameters the europe style and is money that is given to uh companies to business and so on particularly for projects and it is it's like if you're if you're good if you're you know behaving we're going to give you this and it was important because it was something that at some point it became a uh a paramount for oh we need to to to be responsible to show to Europe but that we are doing good because otherwise we're not going to get the PNRRR money and she basically is say we need to rediscuss these uh we need to make sure that this money comes also to for instance to make sure they're going to the whole energy thing and the wall oil thing and the wall you know this this kind of resources we we are well everybody scared here about what is going to happen at this winter and uh we need to on the other hand she say we need to get rid of our uh dependence from russian oil she's very local about that uh these beings uh for instance you know going back to clear and and things like that all the as I say we need to buy oil from different sources we not need to get rid of that and uh we need to um make sure this money coming from europe will be used to avoid the the energy bills of the family to increase too much and this is something that we know that it doesn't sound very good for very well for uh the the the the the european union because they say no this this money you need to use this money to develop business you don't need to know but it doesn't sound very fascist either it's uh rather boring i mean center left yeah no well it's it's it's it's it's a sort of it's right wing because now we arrived to the point is we need to cut taxes you know taxes need to be cut and we need to make sure small business particularly small business will or not be uh cut red tape cut red tape uh cut labor law labor protection more more labor quote unquote flexibility i imagine yes uh oh oh oh of course make sure renting a flat is easier because there's a lot of people remember that in Italy is one of the countries in europe i think one of the countries in the world where there is more people owning uh owning uh real estate okay uh it's most of the people lives and a lot of people lives in in homes they are they own their their their homes and they own other homes at some point there was a a thriving market and it was very easy to buy real estate in Italy so there is a lot of people that really wants to rent those flats but they did taxes is yeah well you know when we come back to fascist it's like there are three countries off hand that I could identify in NATO as being extreme right wing in their politics and that's the united states turkey and the uk and uh the the reason they don't get that label so much is that they were on the other side in 1940 and well more or less and uh that's or or they were neutral like turkey that seems to confer a kind of immunity uh for for no valid reason i mean by by most standards i think those qualities would be more in the way of being proto-fascist than anything in central europe there is nothing for instance you know speaking of fascism there is nothing into the meloni program that says uh uh we need to increase the army and be you know give the possibility to people to buy weapons or things like that it's nothing militant particularly like oh we need to have Italy being more aggressive militarily aggressive against is she's very much like you know we are part part of NATO well yeah but you are getting that kind of rhetoric in all three of the countries I mentioned non stop that we're not very good at fascism we're we're stopping being very good at fascism at this point is uh uh uh at the moment you know we are talking now about what is a completely theoretical program the point is we still don't know what is going to happen to with the government because i people i know with much more involved into the real uh uh uh workings of italian politics tell me look they want by they didn't want enough to make sure they can go and of course i mean the rest of europe whatever meloni tried to do that is not completely aligned with the the the the the making the workings of their european union and NATO uh she will be roasted for that they they they use it to be a joke before the election say that probably the the single person that really wants meloni really wants more than anyone else meloni to uh lose the election is Georgia meloni herself because the moment she's the reality is that she's going she's into a difficult situation if she will be nominated the head of the government because she will have to deal with Ukraine and we all know that the worst situation there is not getting any simpler or any you know um easier i can tell you a lot of pro-russia people or anti you know sort of anti imperialist or anti-nado people really i've been seeing on the feed it's pretty it's it's i don't know kind of mildly funny to watch but they they some of them deeply want to believe that meloni is somehow gonna shake it up and and um you know break up break up NATO and uh and no no side with pool but i mean there are people who believe that or that or that she's gonna be stupid she's gonna i know it is stupid it is uh or that uh you know she's gonna stick it to uh uh stick it to soros and schwaab and the builder berg group or something you know like um yeah it's stupid no no this this is insane this is insane she will find herself in a situation where she will have to deal with Ukraine and whatever happens in your Ukraine in next few weeks and i'm you know my my feeling my gut feeling is that it's not going to get any easier or any simpler and then deal with rising inflation and then deal with rising energy cost and then deal with uh uh some problem that is likely we're going to have inside the working of European Union with uh the change of government in the UK uh and all this kind of stuff i don't think meloni is ready whatever i mean she she might be ready to do that but in any case she can deal with this situation alone so what is going to happen probably is that someone is going to say okay we're going to give you the possibility to form a new government but you need to allow for someone else like maternity or calenda so the real cent liberal center to you know help you on that right one thing that's looming over this as you're explaining who meloni is and is that the original fascist i mean what you're describing is she's gonna have to put in one of the sort of the establishment neoliberals and this sounds so familiar uh into sort of important particular economic positions and probably foreign policy um and this is what how musulinis like the first you know five six seven years of his rule were i mean he came to power in a cabinet if i remember correctly with several very powerful liberal cabinet members in the musulinis cabinet after the march on Rome the liberals ran if i remember right treasury or economy or finance and musulini ruled as as i mean he he stomped on political liberalism but he ruled as sort of an economic liberal at least the first several years so in a way she's kind of being consistent is is that right or absolutely yes yes yes because the the the the element i i think i have been discussing these i've been mentioning these in the uh episode we did a few years ago on the march or rom but the element is that definitely definitely uh musulinis switched to power uh switched from revolutionary uh the the wall uh you know violent coup part of the march of rom to actually setting up a government was a moment where he made that an actual deal with the liberal uh the the the anti-left liberals okay and we're about being responsible be but the point is it really depended from the fact that there is this great book that i have been uh i managed to to read the to read some some some some bit of it in advance that is going to be released in in October by Giovanni Fasanela who is one of the greatest expert on this subject called Nerodilonda black of London that is basically the subtitle is from caporeto to the march on rom out the Italian out the british military intelligence created the fascist party we say that he has interesting yeah he has a lot of evidence taken from uh archa is archival evidence saying that there was a lot of money and a lot of intelligence and a lot of information who did allow musulini to basically to uh do the the wall violent revolution i part at the beginning but in particular to create this network of dealings of uh uh you know of uh mutual comprehension between himself and the liberal center uh well of course was supported by by the brits by by London because the whole idea was one to uh of course avoid the uh uh uh the the the the the socialist and the communist party to prevail in Italy and this was very important from for uh London but on the other hand to make sure that Italy will be uh on the leash uh into what was the mediterranian and the southern uh european politics okay and in fact what musulini did in the first few then in the first decade of his power in the 20s and the beginning of the 30s was to do whatever was good for for England western creditors the creditor class right in London exactly and then the is problem started is is problem started when he became to get into uh uh uh direct uh collision with these people over uh the colonies but until 1933 let's say they were best friends and part of the deals what's the lot okay you need to be physically responsible help uh uh business uh reduce uh any power of the unions and so on and this was the you know the stick the car road part was okay it's okay if you give people uh retirement money uh national system and so on and so forth in order to keep the world thing balanced and to keep Italy and and this is not too far away from what meloni wants to do I think that's part of what I was trying to get at with the idea that fascism uh the the motor of fascism if you want to call it that lives elsewhere I mean there was a feeling I used to get in in New Zealand that on the one hand in New Zealand politics and I don't mean to offend anybody here was was a lot nicer than the politics where I come from but at the same time it was because it's jurisdiction was so much less it was a very tiny part of of the great Anglo grinder and the the grim decisions that really mattered were being made elsewhere and I think I sent some of that in Italy too to be honest I'm not completely convinced that you know what is my I mean one of my mantras is that what happens is Italy is 90% made in Italy is not made elsewhere the the thing I've been mentioning the the obvious sponsorship muslinic got from from the UK because he got that this is not something no we know that yeah he was a my five agent in World War One we know he's on their payroll uh and like I have articles by Churchill praising him and this is clear but at the same time seeing that fascism was just a British op or uh meloni is just uh god knows what op I'm not convinced about that I convinced that the meloni like muslinie is a local phenomenon and but I'm sure what I want to say is that you know confusing collating meloni with muslinie or meloni with footing or anyone close to footing is wrong she's a product or or of something that I don't like to be honest I'm not saying I have any kind of sympathy toward their politics personally but the she's the product of something that is something that stay in this kind of quagmire of very confused very dark spot the stay between the so-called liberal center and the so-called far right there is this space in the middle that seems to work for both sides and seems to work for whatever sides that in the end is pro is basically is pro business because this idea the well idea is that in the end you need to achieve something for the people give that gives you money and the people that give you money normally is some part of the the business universe okay well maybe I'm wrong here and I I don't claim to understand this but I think you've said and several times that meloni represents more a sort of uh right wing paternalism like not the brutal austerity politics of someone like Liz Trust the politics in the center of the decision-making areas are much more cruel there's none of that paternalism and this is the reason why she was voted there is some why she was voted is that one part of the uh Italian voters decided they had enough for that but remember again this is something we have not mentioned so far but this is very important she was voted by the 26% of the 63% of the voters so the the number the real actual absolute numbers of people who voted er is rather tiny is yeah I wanted to say something about that if I may uh one thing I do know about Italian election rules is that uh all of my teachers at this Italian school who are mostly young women had to go home to their hometowns to vote yes they could not vote online they could not vote by male no no no no you don't need to go in your own yeah some of them lived too far away and they couldn't do it so I imagine a lot of young people are in that situation and that would partly account for absolutely yes this is something that is is one of the problems with uh well we have a lot of problems with the foreign vote people who are living abroad that need they need to get in touch with the consulate or embassy to vote but in Italy itself you need to go in your place of residence if if your residence if your place of residence is on the other side of Italy you need to go there you cannot vote in the place where you're living okay and uh yes this is always been a problem like it is uh it is very often a problem the fact that the vote uh happens well not not always but in this case Sunday this was the case on a rather limited frame of time so if you have two days to vote you may find a a moment where you you may go and you may decide in general of course people say oh it's Sunday but there's a lot of people who is working yeah on Sundays okay and a lot of people working far from home it's a big peninsula and then there's a lot of young people working in Berlin they're all over London they're all over okay but I don't think this was the main reason for the law to run out then the problem is that a lot of people say and oh quite few of them they say I don't know what I need to vote for because the point is they look all surprisingly the same people except for few tyrant things like you know the oh you are fascist oh no this is important they say it's important it is a stigma a lot of people would never vote for you if you identify as a fascist but a lot of people say I don't care I mean I want to understand it's particularly people on the left because the big problem of this election is fact that there were two groups uh uh you know we're into a election one was part of the center left coalition and the other one was the so called partito popoare who run alone who could be really identified as left everybody else is a variation of center center left uh what that is well left left why oh yes because we support gay rights okay that is good but physically what are you going to do? no no no as I said that was a shock to me to find that you know central europe which I thought of as postwar stronghold of leftism there's no left party with any power in italy no absolutely they they all but disappear okay and it's very difficult sometimes to to talk with people inside the partito democratic and inside the pd title in them are you sure you're left and say yeah yeah we're we're left why you're left oh because we support the woman rights we support uh gay rights with support minority okay but beside that what what are you your left wing and in particular I mean one obvious thing is that no one question this is interesting no body and whatever part of the political spectrum uh in this election ever dared to question the idea that italy should support Ukraine nobody ever said well maybe we should be discussing I'm not saying we should support putting I mean nobody nobody but it makes a big difference no but there's no range yeah exactly nobody say but maybe maybe we should discuss this and I nobody say that well maybe we should really have a discussion with europe about the rules they're used to be this part we should discuss with europe about the rules right now weren't the five stars was with yeah they used to question the whole sort of monetary structure and the lack of sovereignty by basically handing over your sovereignty to the european union and particularly the european central bank which you know which is massively constrained Italian sovereignty and that's just like not in the cards anymore is it no all right well I think at this point um I mean we could go on and on there's a really interesting discussion and um but we've kept it it's late where you guys are you uh john and uh and and ebule are so let's wrap it up here um uh you know it just it sounds sort of like I mean we're just hitting newer newer phases of this kind of I don't know post 2008 world where politics are failing but we're sort of like in zombie politics land where it just kind of keeps going on and on repeating itself because there's nothing else out there and that's how we get somebody like Maloney or Trump yeah right I mean that's kind of that's my takeaway from talking with you about this yeah yeah she's a good think away we're in zombie land all right and on these cheerful note cheerful zombie note yeah I think thank you so much again I'm sorry I know I forgot all right all right thanks again everyone okay thanks bye bye bye bye bye wow",
