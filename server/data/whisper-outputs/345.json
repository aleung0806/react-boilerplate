    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. The day today is September 13th, 2022, and this is episode 345. On the Ghost Mark games, I am back in Rochester, New York, and I'm on the line with the Warner himself, Gary Brecher, aka John Dolan, Dylan Tropea, right? Yep. You were right on all of those. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, still in Tropea, but back in the hotel, still trying to resolve our Wi-Fi issues, which just can't be done in any timely way. So every time we do a show, we have to book a room. You'll be long gone before they resolve that issue as my big prediction. Yeah, while they sort of kicked it down the road, that's the thing. We're in this Southern Police District part of Calabria for two months, and we lined up to go to the local cop shop, as they say in the Commonwealth, to get our six months visas, which would make us legal residents, which would allow us to have real Wi-Fi. And they never got them. I mean, we filled out these forms at Post Italia for 40 minutes. And somewhere on the 14-mile trip from place we filled them out to the place they were supposed to go, they vanished. And once the people at the Questura, the police said to us, and they said it in a very polite way, speaking very slow Italians, so we could kind of grasp that way you do when you have no a language like, OK, I know that verb. OK, I can grab that. Yeah. That they suggested they just kick it down the road to Trieste, where we're going to be for four months starting in October. So in the meantime, no Wi-Fi. All kinds of, you know, the sort of the stereotype jokes, sort of write themselves here. I'm not the Indian. But the NIRs have all kinds of stereotype jokes. I know, and I don't want to do that. I'm not saying that's what happened. No, I don't. But it's something that is everywhere, want to kick the kid. Yeah, because life's a little better in the south than in the north. The north they're all serious and work all the time. Yeah. I don't know if that's the case there. I mean, I've lost packages from the grimace northern cities you could possibly want to see. Who knows what it means. It just means that we're keeping the hotels of Tropea in business after the season has ended. And that's the one good part of being in a tourist town. Because in Italy, there is a, all capitals way of life. And that means that, you know, August is sacred. You do the vacation in August. But when August is over, places like this just empty out. And at the same time, they get a lot cooler. So it's literally cooler, you know. So it seems like a good deal. Right. Yeah, because now you're past that incredibly hot, humid season right now, right? So it's actually kind of pleasant there. Yeah. No, Wi-Fi, notwithstanding. Yeah, no Wi-Fi. I mean, you thought to watch your feet because the streets are quaintly paved with these big old stones. And ever since I fell and did a dislocation fracture of my arm, I'm very careful about where I walk. So most people are tourists here and they're looking up to see all the quaint old stuff. I'm looking down at the paving, you know, like, oh, there's a little quarter inch cliff. That would knock me down. I should just say real quickly, you know, because I've been, today's the 13th, we're almost in the middle of the month and we haven't recorded a show yet. And it's because I've been in Los Angeles trying to help take care of my brother. I've talked about this probably over the last year and a half on the show a little bit. But my brother was dying of cancer and he died on September 5th and then had his funeral on September 7th because of Jews wrapped that stuff up fast. And so I'm back now. So my mind is not totally there. But, you know, I'm going to do my best. I mean, I have been watching this and I was like, you know, the counteroffensive that the Ukrainians sort of announced it. I don't know, pretty much like a month ago. Or at least people have been talking about it for over a month. But that was all supposed to be down in Karson. I mean, a big part of it is in the South and the Karson region. But it just took a total surprise turn in the heart of region up north last week when I was going through all this really wretched, sad, depressing hell. I'm really sorry about that clearly and I'm sure everybody listening is too. I just don't know what we can say. I'm probably. I mean, you know, there is nothing to say. It's very just strange and weird when somebody, you know, the first person you knew in your life really is dead. And I'm really sad for his kids. I don't want to get, you know, I don't want to violate anybody's privacy. But it's got to really great young kids who are with them right up to the end. And, you know, a lot of people are scared of death is not the right way to put it. Scared of, because we're all going to die, but scared of sort of being around death or letting death into your life in some way, even though it's kind of the fundamental thing for all of us. And I don't think a lot of people, I mean, I've dealt with death now a few, I mean, very, very intimate death. I don't have a lot, but certainly very intimate death a few times. In fact, since we started the show, I mean, it'll fall to the show, but my father died. That was in the first year, second year of the show, and then my brother died just now. But, yeah, his, we were there for him at least. I don't know. It seems to be the only thing you can do is not let somebody die alone. Yeah. But that's about it. But anyway, normally I wouldn't talk about it, but this is a podcast about war, and war is death, politics of killing. So I think people should be able to be a bit more open to hearing about death in this show. Well, as we said in the Civil War live show, our culture used to be a lot better at dealing with that. Yeah. We're quite willing to talk about it, but that's changed and probably not for the better. No. No, because people really can't deal with it. And it still happens. I mean, that's not bad news. Yeah, it's sort of like if we don't talk about it, it won't go away. Yeah. I mean, one thing my brother would get so annoyed with, and I kept having to tell, like my mother, for example, this is when he knew he's known it was over and he would say it over and over. And we would kind of try and find silver linings as going back several months. And it was sort of like you realize at some point how just how deeply frustrated it was no, it didn't bring him any like, I don't know, it wasn't any sort of solve to say, oh, but there's this potential silver lining. It actually, it was more like it was kind of selfish actually to try and find some way of hope in all this when there wasn't hope really. I mean, this cancer had it in for him. And that's just, I think that's just all part of generally people not being able to deal with it, particularly in this culture, a winner culture. Never give up, you know. Yeah, he's fought. I mean, how do you fight your own body? Yeah. Never made any sense. No, your body just gets ravaged until it calcs out. I mean, it's unless, you know, unless you have a type of cancer that can be cured or semi cured, he didn't turn out, but yeah, it sucks. But anyway, I don't want to dwell on that right now. I think first, let's talk about a happier death. I'm sorry, but I have the right to say more pleasing death, which was Queen Elizabeth, the second who's the symbol of probably the most murderous empire in human history. Though you wouldn't know it. No. Oh, the outpouring of bathos was just stunning. And especially from places like, you know, NYT, CNN, WAPO, it's as if suddenly the Aselecorder was the Queen's biggest fan. Yeah. They had flags at half-mask at my kids' public school. Wow. That bothered me. Yeah. And where did I stop by like a synagogue nearby here in Rochester and saw that they had their flags, they have these really flags and the American flag at half-mask. Like, why? Yeah, I don't know. I don't get it. Yeah. It seems like a recent phenomenon to me, although it's really hard to judge things that have happened in your own lifetime in a strange way. Like, I don't remember there being this sentimentality about royalty. And I was in Ireland when, when die died. And the bathos in Dublin was revolting enough. But I assume that wasn't happening in the US. I think it was. I think it was. Yeah. And I think die had a lot to do with, I don't know, that love for it. And then there's sort of, you know, like these Netflix shows, I, OK, I haven't watched it, but the crown, you know, I don't know, just them. There is certainly no, at all, no memory of like how, you know, what the Queen represents. I mean, the Brits did an admirable job of slaughtering and then burning all the papers about the slaughters. And so no one remembered. Now it's just mop top beetles and Monty Python. And no, I think there's been, from what I can see, monitoring these, these things, there's a generational divide too. Middle aged or older is, is very willing to be sentimental about the Queen. Younger people of color in the US and in the UK also are not so thrilled about the whole thing, but they're having to decide whether to talk now, whether it's as they say too soon. And I think there's also a gender dimension to this. I mean, frankly, and I shouldn't even say this, frankly, a lot of what happened with die and a lot of what happened with, with the Queen this time. Well, you know, you, you may call Mary Olletry one of the weak points of cultolicism, but it gives you an emotional release for this kind of stuff. And instead Protestant cultures have to get it from die and the Queen. Oh, God, I'm going to be in trouble now. No, no, no, I don't think that's, I mean, it's true. I don't know is, I mean, are you saying at all that sort of women are more, I mean, my own personal life, like most of the people I personally knew were not sad when lady died, died, but, but of the very few who were, they were women. I mean, I'm talking about Americans, at least, I don't know about Russians. Yeah, there is, there is a gender dimension to this. And it's, and a lot of it is kind of permitted recompense for a lot of unacknowledged suffering. And that's really valid and whatever, but there is that dimension to it. Yeah. I love this. I got to say, it did spark a few interesting moments like this guy Ben Judah, who is at the Atlanta Council. And he's, he's like part of a circle of these kind of pseudo scruffy pseudo Christopher Hitchens types with Peter Pomeransov and Michael Weiss and stuff. And he is, he's somebody because his dad is somebody Tim Judah is a pretty big journalist author and Britain. And he writes here, he's one of these guys who's always scolding the left. There's so many of these. Almost everybody was scolding the left for not connecting or what. Almost all of them work in one foundation or think tank or another. But anyway, he tweeted out, the online American leftist tweeting, ha ha, the queen died LM, a, O, unquote, are the same online American leftist asking, why has our movement failed to connect with normal people? Both sides of a toxic online edge Lord culture that has seen them fail in politics and get stuck in this app. So, so remember, you know, not, not mourning the death of an actual monarch, a feudal board billionaire is why the left can't connect with your average Joe. Let's stage a general strike because the queen died. That would be perfect. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's one of those things where, where you can't win. The, the impulse to laugh is irresistible. But you're going to get called on that by a bunch of people who are hired by places like the Daily Mail, the very, very cruel British tablet, right wing, more right wing than Murdock really. It's pretty good tablet, though. I got a really good, like, God of saying, yeah, yeah. Really good, really evil. Yeah. That happens, by the way, you're allowed to say that. And they're going to blast any such tweets all over the place. But there are some that are just so funny and obviously by a sincere queen worshipper that they can't really be mobilized against those who want to laugh at them. And the one I'm thinking of is some ex-athlete. I think he was a soccer slash football player in the UK, tweeted, got a Chinese in. It's understood to be meal. Because at first I didn't get that and I thought, no, it's what's happening. But got a Chinese in and binned it after hearing the queen had died. Just didn't seem right. So I was like, people speculate, what is the appropriate meal that you're allowed to eat rather than bin after the queen has died? You know, and like, how long do you have to wait after your own queen death thing to have a Chinese? Oh my God. Crumpets, I guess you're supposed to, I don't know what a crumpet is, but I assume it's certainly supposed to eat. Yeah, I don't know. Ground corgi. Corgi burger. Sorry, corgi, so I'm sure you're nice dogs. No, they're not. Cattle dogs. They're meant to bark and bite. The only way they can intimidate animals that big is barking and biting. And that's what they're nipping at their ankles and fleeing from the hooves, right? Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. She looked till she was 96. And now it's trial. I mean, what is, okay, what is objectively funny? Maybe she was a really nice woman. I mean, I, you just, I think you have to assume anybody at that level is a freak because you're, I mean, you're born into this totally unreal world and existence and your job is to be the mascot for, for the empire. And, and I mean, they all must be like Michael Jackson in one way or another. Like have all of the pathologies of like child stars, you know, child TV stars or child movie stars or pop stars or whatever, just they must all be deranged. I don't know. That's what I was. Yeah, well, I think that's going to be more obvious with, with Charles. I know. There are too many photos of him with Jimmy Savile. Who loves to be whitewashed away. Yeah. And that's the, I think everybody, we can all agree that is the funny part of this story. Is that Charles III? Any, any follows on an illustrious chain of, I mean, Charles I had a pretty bad end. Charles, you know, Charles II. Well, I guess he didn't get killed, but he lasted through it. He lasted to 1666. But then they gave his brother two years to, and then they got to annoy them. No, the hell with it, the hell with the whole dynasty. We're going to get rid of you. You got damn papers. So, and that was 1688. So yeah, to me, it just feels wrong. They're being a Charles III. Like, I know. You got a nice set up here. I mean, easy to remember with all that, I hate the dynastic stuff in Europe anyway. I've said that many times, you know, those are the worst episodes for me. Central European dynastic stuff. And at least it helps. Okay, Charles I choppy. Choppy choppy choppy choppy. You can remember that. Yeah. And then Charles II restoration, decadent. You know, and was he a secret Catholic or was it his brother who? His brother death was Catholic and wouldn't even hide it, which he was begged to do. Charles, I don't think was a Catholic. I don't think he cared. There was that legend that he finally had the full rights on his deathbed. But as we said, I think we've seen the usual Phil Casey. Yeah, yeah. We say that. Yeah, okay. Right. All right. I think at this point we can talk about what's going on in the Ukraine war because for many, many months it was slow going. Neither side had any had had really much of any offensive capabilities. The Russians had, you know, somewhat more capability, particularly because of their artillery advantage. And we're, well, certainly in Russia had a good sort of April, May, June, capped off with taking severed Donetsk and Lysi Chonsk and sort of sealing up the Luhansk region. And then they were going to focus on taking the rest of the Donetsk region, which were Ukrainian forces really well dug in. And that would mean really going for Slavjansk and Krematorsk and some of the other cities around there. But those are the two main ones. And I mean, I think what we can say is that in July through early August, Russia made no progress, you know, and I mean, they were probably pretty well spent after taking this Chonsk and Sivar Donetsk. Like forever was, you know, are they going to take Solidar? Well, they took Solidar. You had to go down to these, I don't even know if they would count as villages, more like settlements with a couple of ranches or something. And you had to like micro close up. And then, you know, they were forever going to be taking Buckmoot and maybe cutting off the road between Buckmoot or forever, maybe going to take severed. Like all of these slightly larger than settlement towns and they never really went anywhere. What they did take, which should have been or was, you know, fairly important if you're going in this micro, you know, if you're focusing on a micro level, they did take Biskie outside of Donetsk city, which is an important and strategically important sort of town. So that may be up for grabs now, but they did take that. I think it was last month, about a month and a half ago, maybe. They really hadn't taken much. And Ukraine started their counteroffensive. We talked about this before. We haven't recorded now in, I think, over two weeks. For reasons that I think everybody just has to explain it. They started their offensive. I think we talked about it sort of pre-counteroffensive times. They were making constant pushes. Maybe it was probing. It's hard to tell the difference between the counteroffensive and the probing attacks before the counteroffensive. But they were all focused on the south, on Girozon, because that is everybody agrees that's the most strategically important region. And it should have been the most vulnerable region for Russia because it's such a long front. And it's so strategically important because if Ukraine wants to get any part of its economy going again and it's suffering, a major economic collapse, it needs to regain control of Girozon and the river. The stretch between Girozon and Odessa, basically. Yeah. Well, as much of just its southern coast as possible, I don't think at this point they expect to get Maripu. But certainly Girozon in order to get both sides of the river and just really to be able to open up the seas because that's where most of their exports have traditionally gone through, you know, through the Black Sea. And in doing so, they would also convince their backers, supporters, sponsors in the EU and NATO, Washington, London, that they are not throwing good money after bad, good weapons after bad, that they do have a capability. And so, you know, throughout the summer, the Ukrainians have been training up, training in various NATO countries, in Britain, in Poland. I mean, you know, I'm sure there's so much we're not being told. We're training up forces in all the new equipment that they've gotten the high mars, the M777s, the various armored vehicles, tanks. And I mean, to make a long story short, and then you tell me what you think, John, the sort of, I guess sort of the overall, I think I would say is that they committed a lot of forces to Kyrs\u00e1n, Russia rushed a bunch of its forces down there to shore up their defenses. They made a bit of progress in the Kyrs\u00e1n region, but nothing really to write home about, nothing that would make the European say, okay, we're ready to freeze this winter because that is real progress. And then they saw an opportunity in the north in Harcov. And from what I understand, and again, you know, you go, you do your best to interpret what you're hearing. From what I understand, Russia had literally just maybe a couple thousand, three thousand, two, three, four thousand forces covering, I don't know, about 250 kilometer front or more in the Harcov region. These would be, I mean, the most elite units would be Sobor, which were sort of anti-organized crime, paramilitary troops that served in Chichinia and do sort of, you know, muscle dirty work for the state within Russia. But they're not like, they don't, you know, write around in tanks and stuff. And they don't have artillery and tanks there. They're more like SWAT, special forces. With Orozgvardia, which is the National Guard, which are not the best troops. When they get them from Chichinia, they might be better, but as a general rule, they're not sort of the best forces. And then sort of territorial militia forces from the LNR, from the Lohansk, people's republic. But now the attrition on those, those guys must be terrible. Amazing, yeah. Yeah, because they're being used as sort of the front line guys and pretty much every front. They've been taking the, the LNR and DNR militias have been taking enormous losses, proportionally compared to the Russia proper forces. And the Ukrainians appear to be able to move at will, large forces rapidly. I mean, you know, for whatever reason, Russia's like not taking out power stations and infrastructure in Ukraine. Maybe they can't, maybe they'd have not wanted to, it's very bizarre you've talked about this, John, over and over, going back to the beginning. And they were able to move apparently up to five brigades up to Harcov, and they just cut through them like the proverbial hot knife through butter. There was nothing there. The Russians just fled from this massive front. And they, I mean, in a span of three days, they gave up as much territory. I think the size of Cyprus, just in three days worth of advances by the Ukrainians. Yeah, when you've got armored vehicles moving across roughly flat land, you know, and the opposition is worthless or in flight already, then you can grab a lot of ground. Yeah. And in fact, that's what the papers of record and sites of record have been saying in the West, because you could tell they were sweating for a long time. Like, come on, Ukraine, come on, come on, don't let me down. And now it's like they can, they're waiting to exhale and they can finally exhale. And because Ukraine has now claimed 6,000 square kilometers of territory recaptured. That's 2,300 square miles taken back from Russian control just in the month of September. So I guess, yeah, there are a couple of questions here that kind of demand to be answered and you're the person to answer them here. I'll try. Anyway, yeah. Like, first of all, what is the territory that they're taking? I mean, it's north, well, no, it's east and southeast of Carcola for Carcave for the most part. Izuom, Kopionsk. The question is, are they taking 6,000 square kilometers of land that the Russian army didn't particularly care? Or is this a strategic gain? I would say this, it was not thought to be strategic in the same sense, certainly as, like, you know, Donetsk and the Hanzk people's republics or Oblasts regions have been, you know, named as the goals of the war, like kind of the primary goal of Russia's war, is fully taking both of those Oblasts, both of those regions. They've fully taken Luhansk and they've taken a bit more than half of the Donetsk region and that is, like, currently one of the war aims. And then Kyrs\u00e1n and that whole region is strategically important. Well, I've said, I've already talked about why it's so important for Ukraine, which is why it's also important for Russia to hold on to it because it has leverage over Ukraine by holding on to and basically denying them, you know, economic activity through the Black Sea. And then for Russia, it's also important because of water for the Crimea. Harukov is more like, it's so of the three, it's the least important, I would say strategically. That said, what is, what do we mean by strategically important? I mean, this lightning blitz taking this much territory in a World War I style war, which it has been since, you know, late March, where Russia struggles so hard to take, you know, a couple of kilometers here and a couple of kilometers there, has huge implications, like massive. I mean, and the number one implication is that Ukraine has shown its sponsors, the West, that it's a horse worth betting on. And that I think was one of its very, one of its primary goals in this counteroffensive, if not the primary goal. Yeah, I just want to remind people that we were saying a while back that there were interviews in which I think a distinguished British military observer was saying it would be who you claim to retake territory now. And he was saying that at the beginning of August. So as you say, strategic in this era doesn't mean what it meant when, it doesn't mean what it meant in 1914 anyway. This is one thing that keeps striking me like, if they had 1914 style armies on either side, wow, this poor would have been over really quickly. That's an interesting thing that we also should talk about like why aren't there those armies? Now why are the armies of this age so weak, as Jean will say, but in that case, Ukraine has sealed the deal. It's captured 6,000 square miles, square kilometers, 2,300 square miles, that seals the deal. And even in economic terms, the resources of NATO plus the West, the US, the CIA, the whole deal are so great, especially since they don't give a damn about their own people or what they owe to their own people. That it can be a substitute economy for a while. We can pay off what you need, pay it off, as long as you do this for us. And that's what's going to happen. My understanding is that the Ukrainians have taken a lot of losses, but their morale is very high. Again, you know, you clean what you can clean. I'm always open to knowing that I'm wrong about anything. None of us predicted this lightning blitz on the hardcover region. When I say none of us, I mean, neither you nor I, but not even think tankers, Michael Kaufman, Rob Lee, nobody did. What is kind of interesting is nobody in the mainstream media and think tank land, but I have seen some Neocons crowing since then. Fukuyama, Elliott Cohen, you know, big Iraq war boosters who are back now, like saying, told you they could do it, told you so liberal democracy is going to win. Tuckersies on the way out. But nobody predicted this exact move and what's kind of gross. So now that it's so successful, I mean, I got to say the one thing about the US Empire that has always been aces, top notch, like top gun, whatever is the PR machine. So in the New York Times today, basically the article of the headline is, you know, the critical moment behind Ukraine's rapid advance, the plan behind Ukraine's recent rapid gains in the war against Russia began to take shape months ago during conversations between Ukrainian and US officials about the way forward, according to US officials. So basically, it literally says that. Yeah. And they've been crowing also about Ukraine staff used Western intelligence and advice. Yeah. Suddenly everybody's getting photo-opt with them. That was us. Yeah. Compare that to June 9th. I think I talked about this in an older episode around then. The New York Times ran with, and this is when things were looking really grim for Ukraine. And here's the headline. Despite the flow of billions of dollars in weapons to Ukraine, US intelligence agencies have less information than they would like about the country's war strategy and no far more about Russia's military. So it's like they're not even telling us anything that this is all their faults. Yeah. You know, the interesting thing is that story I mentioned from, I think, a day ago in the New York Times where they talked about how well Western, which in effect means US advice, had done for the Ukrainians. They said, why a couple of months ago, American war planners were complaining that they knew more about Russian strategy than Ukrainians. So it sounds like these stories in the way that they do formed a mode of pressuring in Ukraine. Let our guys in, let them tell you what to do. And narrative arc, as they say. But I just don't know how much to believe. I mean, one thing we know about all of our security agencies and the Pentagon and the FBI and CIA, I mean, they just have been really good at massaging narratives going back decades. This is what they do. And they've always been good at it. That's why half of them are admin, you know. But that said, I'm sure that US intelligence has been very important, has been key. I'm not sure how much the US can actually guide, you know, Ukrainian thinking on these things. It's more skeptical on that. But look, if American advice and weapons or NATO advice and weapons were such a giant and the game changer, then how did Afghanistan fall apart so quickly? That's just the Ukrainians give them their due. You know, they're fighting a much bigger richer enemy. And I granted, they're getting back by all the richest countries in the world. But like, that's not an easy fight. And they're doing it. And they're dying and they're keeping up their morale despite having, you know, a fifth of their country and, you know, practically half of their GDP's stolen from them. So yes, this like this should be about Ukrainians and not US intelligence. No, that's true. I mean, what the US intelligence can do, and even this matters less in the drone era than it did in the satellite era, is send them photos saying, you know, there's this big ol' area up here that nobody's paying any attention. The Ukrainians are quite capable of thinking of that for themselves. Yes. Not seeing that. Yes. Yeah, no, I agree. I mean, it's a useful weapon, but it's the Ukrainians who are using that weapon of intelligence. But, and, you know, it's a question. I mean, now they're saying in hindsight, oh, this was always the plan. Maybe it was that you thrust here. I mean, look, there are even maybe, perhaps some people are trying to stay with a whole, the reason why Kerson hasn't really gone anywhere for Ukraine is because that was mostly a faint to draw the Russians away, which is BS. I mean, they've committed massive amounts of forces to the Kerson front. I mean, there's a perfect symmetry there who else said this was just a faint because we failed. Hmm. Who would that be that was that giant faint to take Kiv? Yeah. And, but, you know, unlike the Russians, what the Ukrainians did was take advantage of opportunities that were opened up. And the Russians just had bad, I mean, I think we can say at this point, look, you and I have said this from the beginning of the war that leaving aside the morality of it or the injustice of the war. It's a stupid war. Putin made a stupid move. It was shockingly stupid. We didn't think it was that dumb. We have to rethink what we think about Putin and it's different from the guy who was a pretty, um, candy operator up until this war. Especially in Syria, I mean, I was watching Syria, especially carefully. And the Russian moves in Syria were smart and they stood out because not that many people were making smart moves. Yes, yes, exactly. And, you know, punching above their weight without being showy and arrogant about, I mean, it was impressive in that sense. And we just have seen a completely different Putin in this war and just the whole kind of Russian stuff. I assume, you know, the general command, I mean, all up and down, they're just, they're conducting this so poorly, it's just shocking. And it really, I think it does start at the top. I mean, people are coming up with different excuses or different just, you know, explanations for it. Um, you know, the, the West, which is back to doing what it did, the West and the pro Ukraine crowd. It's because liberty and democracy fights, but they're back to this now, right? I mean, no one's learned anything from the previous several months when Russia was doing well, Russia, of course, learned nothing from its failures. Like, I think we can get over the idea that anyone learns anything like it's just, you know, whatever it does. Yeah, let's just drop that one. Let's drop that one. Yeah. You know, and now the copium memes are being thrown at the other side, whereas before, you know, Pepe Frog, copium gas masks were being thrown at the pro Russian pro Ukraine. But anyway, um, yeah, I'm speaking of copium, John, you sent me something from a pro Russian blogger who was trying to say this was a, this was actually a strategic withdrawal or some, some along those lines. But I have to say, unlike a lot of other sort of twists and turns in this war, at least on this, in this instance, the pro Russian side, and I thought, you know, I try and follow certain number of pro Russian pro Ukrainian and then kind of think tankers and then some others, whatever. The pro Russian crowd has been pretty brutally honest about, at least the ones I follow, been pretty brutally honest about what's been going on, what they've lost, how awful it is for their side, the Russian side, you know, and, and its significance. I mean, like the Russians with attitude guys, one of them called it the worst Russian defeats since 1996, that would be the Chichen war. Wow. So, and that was probably one of the most humiliating defeats in Russian history, you know, in 1996. So they're taking this very seriously as a defeat. And again, I mean, going back to the top of this, you know, Piscov, the, the Kremlin spokesman today came out and said, because this is even making it into Russian television. I mean, Russian state television. But the Mietro Piscov, the, the Kremlin spokesman was asked by a reporter if Russia's going to now do a call up draft, like a serious mobile, like mobilization for war, because officially it's still a special military operation. And if you don't call it that, you go to jail. Um, if you call it a war, you go to jail and he said, no, there are no plans whatsoever. And it might be right. This may answer one of your other questions, John. So I spoke to a good friend of ours that we know who is in, who just got into Russia for the first time, hadn't been there in a little while. You know, it's been going back and forth fairly often. Just got in there recently and said basically, you would not know that anything had changed. Like if you went to a coma in January or December last year and then woke up today, without anybody telling you, you would have no idea there was a war going on or that there was an economic war sanctioning Russia. He said, all the stores are full of goods. Most Western brands are still there. Like we hear about the brands that have pulled out and get big news and they get a lot of PR out of it. Some of them are very significant, you know, McDonald's, IKEA. But as a general rule, most, if you were to actually, I've seen graphs of this and I had not really thought about it until you told me this, like if you saw a graph of brands that have withdrawn and brands that have stayed, it's by far a majority of stayed and are there on display. Inflation is bad. In rubel terms, dollar terms, and that's something that I think is, you know, that's definitely an effect of the economic war. Like things are significantly more expensive in a way that is very different from, what, you know, we in the West are feeling in terms of our inflation. It's much more significant than that. But everything's normal. And like the idea that, you know, like responding to what people are saying, you know, the consequences of this huge military loss for Russia could lead to Putin being overthrown. This range is laughed and said, like, you've got to be kidding me. That's not even anywhere within a billion miles in the cards. Like it's just from within, it certainly doesn't feel like anything is different. Anything's changed. Well, you know, I'm wondering if that's related to the weakness of, well, really of both sides, but particularly the Russian side in this war. I mean, it's not like the children of the elite are fighting in Ukraine, right? And it's not like the ladies of the upper class are making bandages or whatever. I don't get the sense that this impacts the people in matter in Russia very much. And I mean, whether it's true or not that they're drawing troops from the most poor and remote districts or not, it certainly doesn't feel like it's the elite that's leading the fight there. Yeah, I think it's, I mean, it's, they're drawing their troops from, you know, outside of the five major urban areas as a general rule. And that's how it's always been. At least that's how it's been since, you know, the 70s or something, certainly, been that way. And so, you know, a consequence of that is Russia has a manpower shortage, which is just incredible when you think about Ukraine. So, you know, Ukraine has suffered, you know, perhaps the most catastrophic economic, I'm sorry, population collapse. I can't think of another country in the last 30 years that suffered an economic. I'm sorry. Yeah, we were looking at this together with Izum as the example. Izum is now down to 45,000 people. And some of that can be attributed to being near the front lines for a long time and people moving out to avoid danger of getting killed. But Izum had almost 70,000 people in 1975. And it's been, it was down to 50,000 before the war even started. So, these are half-depopulated areas, a lot. I mean, in 1991 when Ukraine, I'm just going to speak off the top of my head here and I shouldn't do that, but I'm going to do it anyway. When Ukraine went independent for independent, it's population I believe was 52 million. By the time of the Maidan revolution in 2014, I believe the population was about 42 million. So, it lost, you know, that many millions of people to immigration, death to birth, I mean, Ukraine never had really that economic recovery that Russia had under Putin. It kept slogging along. It had more freedom and more democracy, but it kept slogging along economically, pretty much in the same framework as the 1990s. Well, what it exported was people to Moscow. Yes. And people to Russia. Guester by 30 millions to Russia. And then after the Maidan revolution, the EU's big favor to Ukraine for that was to change its visa rules so that they could get cheap Ukrainian labor. And so millions went west as well. And I mean, they haven't done a real census since 2001, so these were like think tanks and World Bank, those sort of estimates. But it was estimated to be down to, I don't know, about 35 million by the time the war started. And then, I mean, I've heard population figures as low as 28 million because of all the refugees that the war made, at least at some point, and they go a lot of them returned. So, you know, you're talking about a population collapse of 30 to 40 percent. That's insane. Russia has not, Russia's, actually, there've always been stories about Russia's population decline. It was a big story a few years ago. Russia is going to cease to exist. Yeah. And it's proof that defying Western autocratic, defying Western liberal democratic norms, you get punished by the gods of populations or something. But of course, you know, this is actually afflicted a lot of, a lot of East European countries, especially former Soviet countries. But Russia's population is about 140 something million, 40, 41, 42, 43. It's declined, I think, from maybe about 150 because they've had a lot of net immigration from neighboring countries that's helped keep it up, even when birth rate has dropped. And also, the birth rate started going up again a lot under Putin after a disastrous decline. But still, so you have, you know, a massive, massive population advantage. And yet, you can't field troops. You have no manpower against this declining, disappearing country. And that's because politically Putin has decided he wants everybody to live in fantasy land. And so that they all praise him as somebody who's great. And there's just a lot of arrogance in that. You know, arrogance towards the Ukrainians from the Russians that just still has not been tempered. I think you can see it in the way Putin and some of these guys midviet of the way they talk about Ukrainians. At times, they'll admit, yeah, we're actually fighting NATO and that's why this is so hard. And yet you won't do any kind of draft or, you know, film manpower needs. If I were a, if I were rooting for Russia and I hear this when I, you know, pay attention to what the Russia stands are saying, like they're pulling out their hair at this point. It's driving them absolutely mad. And Kedirov has been complaining about a lot of a lot of I heard Kedirov say, I'm going to take my guys and take Odessa on my own. Yes, if they can't do it. Yeah. It's, it's, it's pretty stunning and it makes you really wonder what's, what's the goal here? I just, I honestly don't know. But look, this has a lot of other consequences. It's not, you know, taking his doom means Russia's attempt to try and take the rest of Donetsk to take Slavionsk and Kyrmitursk and so on. I think it makes it a lot harder, a lot harder because now they're just going to have to go trench to trace going to be World War I style. They're not going to be able to do any kind of enveloping or cauldron or whatever they can do. There's a river valley that has the highway and has, has the easy way between those places and, and it's blocked now. So that's out. What I thought was the most interesting media phenomenon of all this is that the maps have changed in sources like the NYT or the BBC. So that now Crimea is outlined in a sort of neon blue as, you know, annexed. And there have been stories about Ukraine taking Crimea back, which sounds a little fanciful at this point. But the goals have changed now, right? It's like, ah, today is Yom tomorrow. Sebastian Paul. But don't you remember this from the first month or two of the war? It was the same thing. Russia can't fight. They're a joke. There's the corrupt, you know, and so the question is not whether Ukraine is going to defeat this invasion, but how much are they going to take Rostov and Vaternezh? Or do they go all the way to Moscow? This was the exact same stuff that was going on then. Then that all got kind of quieted down. No, you're right. You're right. I didn't remember that. No. But I have been wondering, looking at the map here of the area, uh, northeast of of Karkiv, is the fact that there are Ukraine has now controls right up to the border. Oh yeah. It would be really interesting if Ukrainian units started moving over that border. No, they were, they were taken selfies of themselves at abandoned Russian border posts up there and spreading them around, you know. I mean, you know, some other consequences I think of who's going to want to collaborate with Russia now? Yep. Because collaborators are being hunted down right now in the Harkiv region and being dealt with by like the right sector, Kraken, you know, these, the basically the right wing commissars that that accompany the military, like they're getting killed and tortured whatever, like what happens to collaborators. So who's going to collaborate with that? And there's an economic equivalent in the defense industries. There have been tons of stories growing about, you know, for a while there, especially when Russian weapons were doing well in Syria, there was a flood of stories about, you know, Syrian war, good news for Russian defense industry. But now it's all the other way like, yeah. Everybody wants American weapons now. Yes. Yeah. Everyone wants high Mars. The deluxe version, not the, not the limiting version, but the deluxe version. So you can hit Moscow. I would say on so many levels, it's pretty damn bad. Now this, another thing you're seeing a lot of on social media is just fake news from Blue checks saying here constantly calling out like evidence of a coup that's about to take place. Putin's just about to be overthrown. I saw some blue check guy getting retweeted a billion times saying friend of mine says, you know, the the garden ring road or the or the outer ring road in Moscow has been closed down. This hasn't happened since 1991. We may be witnessing the coup. There's just a lot of that stuff going on. But whatever that that happens in social media times, I think what is real is, you know, what does this lead to? I've been seeing that Ukrainian forces are potentially massing near Pysky, which is also sort of just west of Donetsk, the capital of the Donetsk region. They clearly can move around at will and they're good at it moving around and they're getting good intelligence. You know, I'm sure with American help there. Well, this is this is sorry, I don't mean to interrupt, but this relates to another long term puzzle of the war. Like where's the Russian Air Force exactly? That's supposed to be able there's supposed to be a specialist ground attack Air Force. That was always the truism that people use like, oh, the American Air Force wants to have dog fights. The Russian Air Force is designed to blow the hell out of con boys. And here we have largely flat land. It's not even winter. The days aren't even short. The weather isn't even that bad. Where's the Russian Air Force? Yeah, it's it's a great question. I mean, these I guess we'll find out, you know, some years from now, what's really going on because there's so much osent fog of war bullshit being thrown up at us. It's, you know, all you can do is try and parse it. I don't know. I mean, maybe a lot of it's not flying. Maybe the man pads, the stingers and so on that are really scaring them off. Yeah, why I mean, I've seen some videos of SU-25s in action, but they're not in that much action. And I think they did take a lot of losses. Whatever people say about, you know, the brilliant key fake, head fake. I think that they took a lot of helicopter losses in the initial. I write off attack helicopters. They're a failed weapon. They're a failed idea. Unless you're dealing with masses of infantry without man pads, but attack airplanes are not. Yeah, they should be the perfect predator for convoys moving on roads across flat land. It's a big mystery and why haven't they take out critical infrastructure? It just keeps going. Yeah, why aren't they blocking the internet? Why aren't they doing all this? I've heard Russia stands as you memorably called them saying, oh, well, and you can tell it's like they're in a rage, but they're saying, well, what I really regret now is that, no, I think Russia will finally take their gloves off. Yes, yes, they keep saying that. And they were very excited when they sent some of their caliber, I think, cruise missiles to blow up some power stations. Now the gloves are coming off. Well, then nothing was falling. They didn't fall up with anything. It's just baffling. There's no other way to explain it. But so has this whole war, the whole idea to do a massive invasion of Ukraine. So it isn't keeping with the baffling stupid logic of Putin on down. One thing that I did think was kind of funny and interesting that I remembered from a Russia stand again, Russia with Attitude Guy. His explanation for why the Russians were caught so were surprised so badly in the heart of region massively outnumbered, eight to one, apparently, ten to one. God knows how much. He said, so the Western version is autocracy's corruption. His version is like I can see this and I have seen this in my life. Commander has a senior commander saying, you know, what is the condition of your company or battalion or whatever. And even though it's really at 15% if you add up equipment, men and so on and so on and so forth, he reports back, it's 100%. Because if he says this 15%, A, he'll get in trouble, B, he'll have to do all kinds of work. He'll get screamed at. He might get demoted. He'll have, but the amount of work he'll have to do is, is he doesn't want to deal with it. So he just kind of says it's 100% and then sort of hopes nothing bad will happen. You know, and that's the that's across all all these corrupt overfinanced armies. That was the story of the US effort in Afghanistan. Like everybody reported back, things are fine in my province. We have not only, you know, to be stachano, but about, we have not only fulfilled, but over fulfilled the plan. And we have, you know, 5,000 ultra-friendly former insurgents who are now ready to go into business for themselves. It was it was all that kind of lie that was just getting kicked up the command chain. So the last one or two things I want to say about this, from everything I'm seeing, and it's not just from the Russia side, it's from sort of the center, think tankland, mainstream media articles, and so on. And from Ukrainian accounts, I mean, it seems like the Ukrainians are taking really, I think I've already said this, but I'll repeat it. They have been taking pretty serious losses. Because a lot of the kind of offensive thrusts have been met with a lot of artillery, and the Russians have been prepared in some of these theaters, very well prepared. And in some places, nevertheless, the Ukrainians are still kind of breaking through, not making the big breakthroughs, but they are breaking through some of the Russian defenses. And from what I can tell, their morale is very high. I don't think everyone wants to say again, you're starting to see this again, their morale is low because they're in a talker seat, because they're barbaric Asians and communists or whatever. I don't think I doubt Russian morale is destroyed, like everyone keeps wanting to believe. I would imagine it's probably hurting morale, though, when you hear about this, and there's no way it's not news isn't getting around. But the other thing I would just say is, to caution is that this is Ukraine's turn, and I mean, good for them, I mean, they're doing this, and they're fighting for their territory, but to assume that now this is how everything is going to go from year on out, most likely that's not going to be the case. Most likely, I would say, I don't want to make predictions, because every prediction is bound to die, but most likely, at some point, the Ukrainians are going to exhaust their counteroffensive capabilities. They've actually achieved their primary goal, number one goal, which is to make sure that they've shown the West, their sponsors, that they're worth betting big on, because they're going to get lost. I think we should really stress that a lot of war-nerdery involves 19th century assumptions that don't work anymore. The idea that strategy is strategy, and a strategic goal has to be a strategic goal, a key railroad hub, or a certain airport or something like that. That's just not true anymore. In this case, a strategic goal is impressing your sponsors, and that's been met, as you say. Because the sponsors are going to have to deal with, it's already starting, angry voters and populations in what are essentially democracies. That's the other side of this. The next great Russian hope, I would think, would be, well, friends of ours who live in London and whose gas bill is usually 105 pounds a month, they were notified that it's going to go to 350 pounds per month. And Rensen London being what they are, the margin of living is very slim for all except the very rich. And that's really going to hurt a lot of people. So I would think, if you were a Russian strategic planner, the idea is you take temporary losses, you maintain morale, you resupply, and you wait for winter because people are going to be suffering massively if all Russian gases cut off from Western Europe. But I don't know. I think that is part of the plan, but I don't think losing, you know, 6,000 square kilometers was part of the plan too. No, no real way further. 50 dimensional chess. No, look, we, I absolutely renounce any such notion, whether for Russia or for Ukraine or, you know, for the Monaco, the idea of strategic faints to draw the enemy in, no, no, that's not what's happening. But again, and the last thing I would just say is, if recent history, that is to say 2022 history, is any lesson for us, it would suggest that most likely Russia is going to have its time again, and they're going to be sending the copium peppy memes to the Russian, to the Ukraine fans, and then it's going to go back and forth. But it's going to be in different ways. I mean, you know, war is like by nature very unpredictable. So it doesn't necessarily mean that, I mean, we hadn't really thought about the possibility of thousands of square kilometers falling in days until now. Nobody had nobody had. And I think because nobody had thought that the Russians would leave as massive terror, just leave a, you know, a couple of thousand scrubs to defend this massive territory, which the Ukrainians could take advantage of. I mean, it's, again, it's just boggling how poorly the Russian commanding in this war has been. And you have to assume it's going to go on for a while. Like, this is just that is something that will go on for a while. But there's another thing that's supposed to be happening and doesn't seem to be happening. The Russian army was supposed to have been completely reformed in the last decade. And part of that involve changing the weapons mix. But part of it involved the habit of treating soldiers as someone, some Russian observer said long ago, treating its own soldiers like hated prisoners of war. And that was supposed to draw people into the army and make them more willing to volunteer. Right. Not necessarily as contract guys who are, you know, have a really grim death squad type job. But ordinary soldiers helping with the necessary technology. And behind the command problems, there seems to be a real personnel problem like getting people who know what they're doing and are willing to sign up in large numbers. Yeah. I mean, I would imagine there might be, you know, half moves in that way to retain. I mean, so I've heard that they are, I've read that Russia has been sort of offering early release kind of emptying out their prisons. I think Ukraine did some of that early on in the war too. It's not uncommon. But, you know, offering early release to anybody who would give up prison for the front lines in the war. It's quite an opportunity there. And they are offering huge bones, signing bonuses. They're offering huge signing bonuses to people to sign up. And they're trying to, you know, sign up or re-sign up people who are specialists in areas. But they're just, they're also at the same time trying to pretend everything's normal and it's not a big deal. Right. And you're right. Like, what about this great big reform? I mean, I think it turned out to be half-assed. You know, had made some progress here, fell back there, stepped on the wrong toes, Sir Dukov. I think it was Sir Dukov, who was Defense Minister when it started. You know, the other thing is I think they tried to go light and mobile. This is this is very much a rich country thing. Well, America does it and so people try to copy. The hope is that you can do these things with smaller forces who are, who can do so much more with so much less. They're so specialized and highly trained and with all the perfect equipment. I mean, that was the Iraq War plan. And so at least the invasion part went pretty well, but it was everybody agreed afterwards. Well, we had far too few troops who actually occupies and subdue the place. You can't, you can't do these these no big wars. It's a grotesque idea. Like, I mean, I should say it's been going on for most of a century. The US and what was the Soviet Union mirroring each other's ideas like the Bradley is very much a Russian BMP that's been a reverse engineer. It's a long story, but the big Cold War powers were doing this for a long, long time. But the idea that anybody would say after Iraq, let's do what Rummy did. It's just too grotesque. I know. Yeah, Afghanistan, that'll also worked out well. It's very strange. Yeah, it goes back to the whole Kakaimani idea of doing this big invasion of Ukraine. All right, I think, John, I think we can wrap up this episode, just sort of an emergency Ukraine blitzkrieg in Harkov episode. We needed to do this. It's been a difficult time for you, but we'll do this and we'll finish catching up on our Cyprus story in our next episode. Yeah. Okay. All right, good. Yeah, so next episode we're going to finish up with Cyprus, the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. Anyway, thanks again, everyone. Talk to you everybody. Bye.",
