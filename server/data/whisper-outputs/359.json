    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. Today is December 15th, 2002 and this is episode 359. I'm going to go to Smart Ames. I'm up here in Rochester, New York, getting our snow. Everyone's sick. Everyone's everyone in this house. Pretty much with something that seems like COVID or COVID-ee, but apparently isn't after like eight home tests. I've been sick all week too. You have been kind of thin. I've heard different people in different sort of parts of the Twitter world, whatever, talk about getting something like this where it's like the weirdest flu they've had in a while and other people are saying, yeah, well, immunity systems have been sort of, you know, damaged one way or another from COVID. Either you've caught COVID or you spent time with masks and then you took masks off. And I got to say this thing is freaking weird. You know, it leaves and then comes back with a vengeance and then leaves and comes back. So I'm going to do my best not to hack too much during this interview. Anyway, we're on the line, of course, with the Warner himself, John Dolan, Gary Brecher, and Triesta, John, how you doing? Well, I'm in, I had my own medical scare and I'm okay. I, the doctor literally told me to go out and smell the flowers. Like, you know, you're too tense. That's the problem. And it's like, yeah, I know. It's like one of those medical advice bits where it's like, you know, the way you are, don't be that way. But anyway, basically good news. But I just wanted to say I love Triest. I think this is one of the best cities in the world. This is like four episodes in a row where you said you've loved Triest, which is a record for any city I can think. I know, I know, it's, it's, it's just a great city. Like today, I'm out. I'm trying to force Catherine to buy some clothes. Catherine, oddly enough, has to be just about held at gunpoint to buy clothes. So, and we walk past this plaque that she points out to me. And it's got the name of some Italian army veterans underneath it says Moga Dishu. And this is how I find out about the battle of checkpoint pasta. No kidding. Checkpoints pasta? Yeah. And in July 1993, there was a battle between Italian troops in Moga Dishu and Muhammad ID, the same warlord who eventually was involved in the Black Hawk down. Yeah. Famous name for a brief while. Yeah. Famous bad guy. And this several Italian troops and quite a few more Somali militia guys were killed in this battle at a Berea pasta factory, which by the way hints at the Italian influence in the Horn of Africa from their early 20th century colonial phase. And that's the thing about Italy. You see these extraordinary memories of the very wild, very star-studded 20th century history of the place. How much longer you guys are there for it? Do you know what your next move is? We only have about a month left on our six month visa. And then we've got to get out of the EU for a while. And we don't really feel a lot of enthusiasm about any place. You know, it would be nice to go someplace warm for the winter, but I don't really like the idea of a 25-hour flight to New Zealand or something getting tired of those long flights. Traveling and stuff. Yeah. It's tiring. Well, hopefully, hopefully you guys will be able to plant your warlord flag for good sometimes soon. So let's get right to our interview. We have a great interview with, in fact, you know, John had said, I don't know, we were talking about episodes for December like last month. And John, you had said, you know, what about Smetley Butler? I can't remember why he brought it up. And I was like, oh, yeah. And I thought we were going to wind up reading wars or racquet, you know, the famous book. But actually, it turns out there's a great book, really great book written about Smetley Butler and sort of Smetley Butler as the thread to talk about a lot of things, particularly, you know, American imperialism, imperialism, its imprints and so on. I mean, it's just a really good book. Great guest. Let's get right to the interview. We're going to be speaking with Jonathan Katz, author of Gangsters of Capitalism, and let's get right to it. Okay, we are really excited to have with us our guest today, Jonathan Katz, to talk about somebody, John and I were talking about for a while. We need to do an episode on Smetley Butler. And Jonathan's written a great book. A book that, it's the sort of book that, as a writer, you'd want to have written about, and I'll get into that in any way about Smetley Butler. Jonathan is a journalist and author. His first book was The Big Truck that went by how the world came to save Haiti and left behind a disaster. He served for, for I think eight years as an associated press reporter, many of those years in Haiti. And he also runs a, he writes a newsletter. The racket.news will post links to that. And we're going to talk with them today about his new book that came out earlier this year. Gangsters of Capitalism, Smetley Butler, The Marines, and the making and breaking of America's empire. So first of all, thanks for joining us and welcome to the show, Jonathan. Yes, great to be here. Yeah, I was just saying like one thing I, I mean, it's a great book, really a great book. It's a great sort of, I don't know, entryway into talking about all kinds of things, whether it's Smetley Butler, who is this Marines general, who we're going to be talking about, or about American imperialism, or about the effects of American imperialism back and forth throughout the world and back in American domestic politics. But you have this thread, which is Smetley Butler's life. And you just go sort of, it's a perfect, very grim thread from one spot to another, to all these very obscure, I don't even know, I guess officially we wouldn't even call them wars, but there's a reason why we don't talk about them too. But from one sort of destructive conflict to another. And you mix that in with your own, then personal, I mean, this is what I mean by sort of a writer's book as well. This is the kind of book you would like to write. I mean, you could, you could write a book about Butler, and it could be all almost overly polemical or something, and that would not have been as interesting. But in this, you're able to use Butler as a thread, as a way of visiting places. And then as a way of also, you can go off on any sort of related but tangent to tell all these other stories as well that tie back in. So it really, it worked out great. So I know your first small just congratulations. I really appreciate that. It took me, it was the book that I wanted to write in the way that I wanted to write it. It took a lot of doing and struggle to get there, but I'm glad it worked for you. Yeah, I found the Philippines episode particularly interesting because that was a big and very nasty war fought by the American military and it's almost forgotten now. And you even got in on a movie and there's a photo of you as an extra or something in goi the boy general. It's right. It's called. Yes. Available on Netflix. I just saw their available on Netflix. I haven't watched it yet. Are they, are they good? I mean, I saw the reviews of it are pretty patronizing, which is to me. Maybe it's good. I would say so it's is the sequel to another movie called. Henner Aluna, right about about Antonio Luna, who was who is one of the first commanders in chief of the war the Philippines side of the war against the Americans. I think Henner Aluna was a little bit better. Goi, kind of it doesn't quite land on. It tries to do a lot. I kind of I I identify with it because I also work with I almost died. You know what I'm getting electrocuted exactly exactly. Yeah, so I you know I I it's it's watchable. It's it's it's long and it's mostly in Tagalog. So so you got it's like three hours you got to strap it for a lot of exposition in Tagalog but it's you know it's it's an interesting movie and just as as a as a cultural artifact and as a piece of historical memory it's it's fast it's fascinating to me. I will let me put it this way. I watched the whole thing. I think my wife fell asleep halfway through. So it depends on your interest in that. I hope you woke her up when you came on. Look, this is me. I think she was awake for that part. I think I got it. That's all I need. So the subject's medley butler. I mean before we get into it. I think the best way maybe to go about is the kind of somewhat fall along the the structure of your of your book. But I think if people know who smedley butler is first of all it's like it's almost like a cartoonishly ridiculous first name smedley butler. I mean it does sound like I had a barbarer name or was that I get deadly do right or smedley but I don't know. But if people know the name smedley butler I think it's a role they know his somewhat famous book War is a racket which has been popular I think among people in the sort of you know critical. Of the US Empire critical militarism it's kind of a classic so it was an underground classic at least when I was young I think feral house put out. Wars a racket when I was younger but just even sure it did a forward to one of the additions the can really wow yeah that's where the on right because I and as I was saying before the show. I mean when you heard if you heard about smedley butler you heard that book the name of the book and so it would be it was popular with libertarians sort of libertarians who are mostly there for the anti militarism anti imperialism anti government right because it's another thing that proves government's bad. And then you know also anti imperialist on the left and then you heard his name in the murky which has become sort of less murky over the last few years you know the famous business plot the alleged and well pretty quite possible I think we just don't know the details of it there was clearly something of foot plot to overthrow or at least destabilize FDR early in the new deal after the business community turning. And so the business community turned against him and and basically up you know some of these business people had one of the representatives trying recruit smedley butler to be I don't know the ringleader of a kind of mass veterans led to overthrow FDR and stop the new deal. I really know any more beyond that and I think one one of the problems with getting into this medley butler story was that for a long time it really was kind of I don't know if you found this but at least when I was younger it was kind of owned more or less by like conspiracist on the on the far right I want to say used this moments of that is named that weird bircher guy who thought thinks the fed was a masonic conspiracy or something like that. It was kind of somewhat owned by those people so that scared away I think a lot of other people from looking too much into it but when I used to do a lot of writing about early you know libertarianism the origins the early days I mean when you go back to the liberty league the American liberty league I mean it's basically those same people that set up the American liberty league. You know the DuPonts and Morgan and some of these others they were at the same time involved in this plot with smedley butler but I guess so I guess I don't know the first question is what made you decide to write a book on smedley butler what brought you to that story and you know did any of this stuff I'm in the fact that people kind of knew him that he was already sort of maybe pigeon hold that were you at all how did you approach it. Yeah no those are all really good questions I would say I was somewhat unacculated from that or maybe came in initially a little bit oblivious to that because I came into butler through a you know from an American standpoint an unconventional point of view like I learned about him in Haiti. I talked about this a little in the book it was it was really while I was writing my first book the big truck that went by I was writing a chapter on on the history of Haiti to explain you know how things had gotten so fragile that a magnitude seven earthquake became the deadliest earthquake ever recorded in the western hemisphere and that just required sort of you know going back and excavating a little bit of the history of progresses. I was really a really American imperialism you can't talk about the 20th century in Haiti you can't talk about the way things were in 2010 or even now in 2022 without talking about the US occupation of Haiti which was a thing that I didn't know anything about until I moved to Haiti and I know that you know and I was pretty well read you know I was in American studies American history major in college I you know I actually one of my first in favorite classes in college was like a very you know from from some of the points you would call it like a revisionist history but it was just history of like United States during the cold war it was just a history of like you know the coups that we you know the CIA oversaw against you know most a decadent Iran and our bends and and Guatemala etc but I hadn't heard anything about the the invasion and occupation of Haiti. Yeah I just reminds me of the epigraph to your book. I should proper great problem yeah yeah the one who strikes the blow forget the one who bears the scar remembers. Yeah yeah. I'm sorry but they're not so much a saying in Creole yeah it was so so because I came into it knowing Hitler primarily as a villain really I mean I knew him as the guy who. Who you know carried out the massacre for V.A. which is the battle that that right I got his second medal of honor for. You know as the guy who dissolved parliament in 1917 the guy who as an amazing story by the way that hope. Disolving the parliament and then making sure the records are burned you know what basically they had disappeared yeah. Yeah because of that so I it was in that initial round of basically you know research for the big truck but I just stuck his name in the Google. And that was the first time that I ever heard of wars a racket or the business plot in fact at first I was like this can't be the same guy. How did how did this guy who Haitians literally called the devil like how did he then you know they couldn't it must be a son it must be like some like father son like. Yeah he did have a son named Smedley but it was him and and that and it was that story that really kind of got stuck in in my brain and I realize once I realize the extent to which he was you know in a lot of ways the main character of American Appearance for the first decades of the 20th century and the extent to which his you know sort of. Layton life or gradual you know that they're two ways to look at it turn about was a way to understand sort of the the eternal misgivings that americans and we're not unique in that all imperialist you know you pretty imperial smash imperialist they all they all. There are examples of this in in in every empire. But you know the way in which that could tell a larger story about America and our place in the world in the way the people you know in other countries look at us that was why I wanted to get into it as I was doing research you know this this book took. You know basically five years and in the writing well kind of seven years in the making I definitely encountered a lot of people on a scholars especially. You know one one couple in particular that I remember who were just sort of like you know I you know when I when you when you said smelly butler my normal reaction is like this guy must be crazy like anybody who comes to me talking about smelly butler must be a nut job. But I came you know sort of well enough credentialed from my other work that they were like well I guess I'll hear this guy out right I definitely I definitely encounter that there was a really strong effort. To discredit the whole idea of the business plot for a series of reasons did you find that there's there's still that. Out about the existence of this plot first of all yes definitely I've encountered plenty of people online and especially I mean not necessarily people who really spent any time looking into it. But there is just sort of a there is sort of a a reflex reaction you know as you guys were saying like it has become the doubt it's a conspiracy theory it's a theory of it is a it is a conspiracy and and talking about it you know involves talking about a conspiracy and so it has become the domain of conspiracy theorists. In one of the versions of loose change that was circulating online they did like a they did like a post script about the business plot. Which didn't make any sense like even in context of a film that didn't really make a lot of sense like it was like I think they were just sort of doing that to be like look see there are real conspiracy so the one that we're talking about must be must must be valid. But you know you know in general like I haven't encountered anybody who has really looked into it in any kind of detail. Who is like you know this is this is you know this is crazy it's mostly people who sort of you know glance at the Wikipedia page or you know conspiracy theorists all forth about it. And I think it's only kind of I don't know in the last five to ten years not total fringe people have kind of looked at it again and considered it and because before then I just don't think people were interested in hearing about it. Right. Remember right from my research on it. I think even FDR and his people were sort of like we want to bring this out in the open to know that we can you know to stop it and the names of names but we don't want to get too deeply into it because it's kind of it's destabilizing to make too much hay of it in a sense too. I mean it could also be destabilizing and if I recall right I think you know FDR sort of didn't want to make too much of it either he just sort of he was all right with him getting it out there but I think you advised Dick Dixon. You know don't don't push this too far don't drag more people. That seems to be that seems to be I mean that's certainly my working theory is that essentially you know I think insofar as FDR thought he could get any political benefit out of it being public he had already gotten it from the amount of publicity that Butler had already brought to it and then Butler took the hit Butler but right exactly I mean one of it one of the one of the criticisms of that that I've you know encountered online of of you know from people who you know it sort of you know respectable. So I think that's sort of respectable as scholars right that they're sort of like well this was just Butler trying to get publicity for himself but if that was his goal it yeah first of all wasn't his goal second of all it completely backfire I mean it really discredited him it made you know the because he got just mocked he just was dragged relentlessly by the New York Times by Times magazine you know they they you know Henry Lucin and eight off folks specifically you know they were you know they wanted to do everything possible to make him seem ridiculous so so you know FDR kind of was able to have his cake and eat it too he you know the whistle was blown the plot you know embryonic or well formed as it may have been we have no idea at least I don't know yet maybe there's some more research that I can do to try to answer that question you know but by blowing the whistle it seems to have kind of fallen apart of its own volition and then he didn't have to then you know he didn't have to then you know go out in public and and be like you know a I'm so weak that that you know these you know powerful American forces are trying to overthrow me on and and be you know I'm not I'm not I'm not crazy I'm not I'm not you know alleging that this this conspiracy gets me for which you know maybe there's there's only a little bit of of you know somewhat circumstantial evidence but the I mean I don't know but that that's that's one of the theories but the one thing that I will say is that is interesting as at the moments in in history since the business plot so that Butler reveals it in in 1934 that it has sort of reemerged a lot and you can say the same to a certain extent about about wars a racket and butlers and anti imperialism in general are sort of at moments of yeah you know great questioning and embarrassment of the empire in the United States so in the 1970s in the in the aftermath of Vietnam of our involvement in Vietnam you know you have a jewel's archer writes his book you know the plot disease the White House which was you know one of the only books out there about the the business plot for a long time you've got you know you know people in the military who are starting to circulate you know copies of of wars a racket again and now you know we're we're at the outset of you know the catastrophe in Iraq the depending on how you look at it the fit some things were accomplished not necessarily good things in the war on terror it's it may be giving them too much credit even to say that the whole thing was a failure because a lot of money got made and and a lot of you know the military industrial complex very well well but but you know broadly speaking you know we're at this moment right now where you know the Taliban defeated the United States in Afghanistan we don't like the Americans in the respectable media don't like to talk about it that way we just talk about it sort of just in George Packer wrote his piece in the Atlantic a couple weeks ago where he just sort of referred to it vaguely it's like the fall of Afghanistan like we have been happened yeah it was up but yeah so yeah I mean you know the US is is is is defeated by the Taliban you know we we're sort of in this period of you know somewhat limited not really on a full imperial scale but you know some some limited at least at a two-dinal retrenchment it's in moments like that the people are like hey you know maybe right and I now and of course the January 6th business really blew the whole cortex of mainstream opinion so they might be more willing to consider yeah domestic application and and you know Butler was clear about this that he was talking about bringing those wars home and doing something domestic and and it seems as if even though he didn't say this far as I know but that's where he drew a line like I'm not going to I'm not going to do it to my own country yeah exactly exactly yeah no that's that's very much the case I mean I you know in my newsletter actually I wrote a piece comparing you know what I when I what I called you know riffing on on the title of Jewels Archers book Trump's plot to seize the White House to the business plot I wrote I wrote a piece because I've been watching you know the you know from sort of the whatever was the 2 a.m. you know illegal press conference high-tech the legal pro at Hattac excuse me illegal press conference in the East Wing of the of the White House on on election night through the you know the crack in and like the conspiracy theories about you know the voting machines and things like that I was seeing this sort of you know coup in the offing and I saw so many parallels to the things that you know happened in the business plot and the Butler was talking about in the early 1930s that I wrote a newsletter about you know the headline was something along the lines of like in Trump's plot to seize the White House who will be our smithly butler I put that on on January 4th so and then obviously when two days later you know as as a as a citizen I couldn't have hoped for for a worse outcome as as as a writer I was like well that I'm not I was ready to go on that stuff and watching you know January 6th through the lens of the research that I've been doing so so one of the things that one of the details is that so so butler is approached by Gerald C. McGuire who's a right on salesman member of the American Legion representative of the financial house to recruit him into this coup and McGuire has gone on this junket across basically fascist Europe he's visited Rome he's visited Berlin where Hitler has just taken power and the main thing is that he's visited Paris where six weeks before he got there there was a fascist coup or of an attempted fascist coup of fascist and far right groups veterans groups sort of this you know these motley organizations it was on February 6th 1934 so it's still known in in France as the cease fiefries as February 6th they rushed the seat of the French legislature the Palais Bruban to basically prevent a transfer of power to a center left government on a conspiracy theory first of all an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory which I won't get into but just you know they blame the Jews and then they were also like you know and they were basically like this this this alliance between you know the Jews and and what was known as the radical party but you know from from arts standpoints and center left parties basically the democratic party of France 1934 that basically they were going to usher in a Marxist dictatorship and they it ended up being a you know complete you know cut the scoff like the the the the writers didn't make it to the Palais Bruban they basically ended up clashing with police most of the people who died were the writers some police a couple of bystanders but it did succeed in putting you know French politics into a tailspin and did succeed because it was a parliamentary system in the center left party not coming to power a conservative coming to power instead and then did up inspiring both the popular front of you know leftists and liberals that that ended up you know sort of being able to hold off fascism until the Nazis invaded and then once the Nazis invaded the state of the state of the state and then once the Nazis invaded a lot of people who end up going to the Vichy regime had participated or or came out of the aftermath of of that you know fascist attempted coup and Jerry McGuire when he comes to Butler he says specifically that he is met with the quod of the fiery cross which was one of the veterans the sort of far right quasi fascist veteran's organizations that he carried out this this attempted attempt to do that. And he says the Butler this is the sort of organization we're going to have he's what he's saying is we're going to specifically turn the American Legion which already was very much people don't really remember this today because the American Legion still around but it was very much a street fighting cadre like they they were big union busters and yeah they beat up anybody on the left they were it was one step away from like the black shirts right exactly yeah I mean they you know they were they were you know in the in the escalator. And they were like a lot of the technology of like American far right groups today they were maybe a little bit more like the oath keepers than the proud rise but they were they were really they were on that end especially the street fighting part and big was it was and big I mean they had huge numbers so yeah it was for real. And as I say in the book right they they they they used to at their annual conventions they would present greetings from a wounded veteran of the great wars in your Mussolini they invited Mussolini to speak at their 1930 convention only to have that to be forced to resend that invitation in the face of of a basically labor labor protest. But but anyway all that is to say that what you know what McGuire had in mind in so far as we can envision what McGuire had in mind he was trying to basically do a cease-feverie in Washington and you know they're like January six cease-feverie is even the same day of the month. Yeah it's it's and yeah I mean I think I think that especially you know that there's there's a there's a deep and abiding conviction that many Americans have had for many generations that as a Sinclair Lewis who also crossed paths with with Smelly Butler. You know titled his his books are sarcastically you know it can't happen here. So I'll be a little bit responsive by the way called the hell it can't. But but you know there's that there is that long standing notion that a lot of Americans have that oh you know we can't possibly have fascism because you know we are we are America we are special we are we are we have been vaccinated against. And and and and and and and I think what you know what January six what what the whole Trump experience and the ongoing Trump experiences shown. Not everybody but a large number of Americans is that you know that kind of authoritarianism can happen here that you know fascism can happen here and I think that has you know that that opens up a lot of people's eyes it's certainly something that opened up my eye and also you know my experience overseas and seeing the. The United States actually does do in the world opened up my eyes to the to the possibility that you know when I read about a you know a mooted fascist coup in the United States i'm just like yeah that tracks that sounds like that sounds like a that sounds like a part of America that I know for listeners out there I mean to understand the gravity of this business plot it wasn't me the the the bond trader. Was sort of the flip he was sort of the guy you know bringing in the wads of cash and showing off and talking about the plan but he was directly connected to real heavyweight starting with his boss grace and Murphy who you know a JP Morgan. You know military intelligence of a buddy with bill while bill donovan and the 20s that you know I mean this there were real heavy hitters and I remember reading a book the corporate state and the broker state about DuPont which DuPont and its day well for a long time I mean it was sort of like coke industries plus and extremely powerful extremely influential in in right wing politics. And those guys also were up to their eyeballs in this plot so it was it was real people and you know it might have been an actual fascist coup but it might have been a threat like a much scarier tea party where you bring all these veterans there and force you know knock knock the new deal off its rails or whatever it was to gain some leverage but it was the people behind it were very real and great grace and Murphy is is to me the the key to understanding that. And the reason why I I haven't actually seen anyone go you know anywhere near as much in detail about grace and Murphy's past as I did in in the chapter they wrote about it and I it wasn't you know because of any you know special genius that I had it was because of the direction that I came to the story from like I I came to it from a from I was I was doing research and I've you know lived my life you know sort of in you know at the peripheries of the American Empire. And and you know the the implications of of of you know capital and the military power and and that was the book that I really set out to write so I wasn't it wasn't really until it wasn't really until really January 6. I knew I was going to have the business plot in the book somewhere because how do you write a book you can't write a book about Smirley Butler right without the business plot first of all is too interesting is that kind of all people picking up are going to be very just a point. Yeah but I wasn't sure you know what when I when I set out to write this book so I I pitch this thing in 2016 and at that time that that's what that's when I you know sold sold it off proposal to the publisher and at that time I thought I was going to be writing a book I was going to do the past present thing and I thought that you know the present was going to be you know this long build up to the apotheosis of America's great neoliberal empire under the the sure to be and soon to be president Hillary. Yeah and and so I didn't I mean I first of all I had no idea that I was going to be writing a book you know about the Trump presidency even the morning of that election I didn't know that this is going to turn into and I knew there was a possibility but I didn't I was one of the maybe I was just fooling myself I guess I was but I just I thought I would know but it can't happen. But um but um and so you know and so it was because you know I think that I think that a lot of people who sort of take a lot of people who come to the business plot from a position of American politics you know you got two political parties and you've got you know the history of America you know as told from the Imperial center you know the view from the metropolitan like this seems ridiculous this can happen here but from the beginning of the world and I think that the end of the world is going to be the end of the world. From the from the perspective of all the things that I am you know sort of living in historical memory and and and researching you know you know butler you know in the Marines you're dissolving the Haitian parliament that that was again that was like a cease-feverie a January sex style thing except to work right they actually dissolve the legislature it didn't meet again for 12 years you know but we're helping to overthrow and then protect the public government of of Nicaragua. You know all you know all of these you know Honduras of etc and all like coming to it you know the Panama conspiracy right like it was if you you know and historians of Panama people who who who understand the history of Panama know this but people who don't know Panama and don't know what happened. I mean just very briefly like it was part of Columbia and we severed it from Columbia with the help of Panamanian elites it was a state of of Columbia at the time to build the Panama Canal it was it was 100% a conspiracy there's no other way to to describe it. You know the the the bag man for William Nelson Cromwell of of Sullivan and Cromwell you know again yeah features big in their book but go. Exactly so yeah Roger Farnham who is his go between and ends up basic he's one of these figures like Smelly Butler like there's all these kind of zealog like figures that just show up everywhere and he's one of them and he's on like every board and every bag man it's amazing where he's going to go. It's amazing where he's at and he plays a huge role in the invasion and occupation of Haiti he basically is the one who puts the bug in to William Jennings Brian's here it's like why don't we write the central bank of Haiti and then in his successors like why don't we invade anyway so you know Farnham writes a news he plants a newspaper article ahead of of what happens on November 3rd 1903 that basically says on November 3rd because it's election day in the United States nobody's going to be paying attention. On November 3rd US warships are going to come and and and there's going to be an uprising in in the state of Panama and it's going to declare independence from Columbia and that's what happened I mean it's it's it would be unbelievable except it's what happened and so and and and Grayson Murphy who is is a. Jerry McGuire's boss in the business plot so Grayson Murphy is in military intelligence he is posted to south and central America and comes back to personally brief. Teddy Roosevelt the president of the United States on things that are happening in the state of Panama whatever it was two three weeks it was in October of 1903 before this takes place so when you come to it from that perspective it's it's experience in a lot yeah so to smidly butler and they faith they probably just wrongly figured you know he's one of us he's he's he's overthrown democracy is he's done this he knows how the game works right yeah so it becomes it becomes much easier to like yes look at that resume and be like oh I mean of course like you know again that's you know maybe somewhat circumstantial but it's like it's not a stretch to think that this guy who set up a private intelligence network by it while Bill Donovan as he said the the head of the OSS in Europe after after World War One could think you know and was by the way the treasure of the Liberty League which was found about the DuPonts which is supposed to be the money behind this thing right you know it's it's not for me not a stretch yeah that's okay I think it's a great thing to do so we've because that's also how you still open your book with that kind of spectacular episode then you go back through butler's history and again using him as a threat and it's a it's a great threat I mean it's it's strange like butler is I was talking with John a little bit about this and he's so he's a hero to a lot of people because he took that's it because you know wars a racket and it is a big deal but it's a great thing that he went public with this plot against if you are it's a great thing you know unless you're a DuPont you know or a Morgan but he's a somewhat familiar figure alien to my world but is it like you know suburban California Jew or whatever but I but I come across these types when I read about him this fierce upper middle upper class Quakers there's a lot of them and he's not Quaker yeah so it's the fact is really interesting it is so it tells a little bit about his where he comes from his his background he's a very unlikely future sort of hero of anti imperialism as for sure but yes yes well yeah yeah so yeah the Quaker part especially although as I as I excavate a nasty side to the history of Quakerism and and you know there are also other Quakers in the 20th century like Herbert Hoover and Richard Nixon yes who also came out of that you know perhaps unlikely background right so yeah he butler comes from the main line of Philadelphia just off the the actual main line of public works in Westchester and he is from a just straight up upper class family old Quaker family basically came over with William Penn just just after his fathers of congressmen his grandfather Smetley Darlington which is who he was named for was also a congressman and you know his mother is is basically you know the the air to it's not a fortune but it's a it's a lot of money I mean they're they're very well connected in banking and law on the main line with anybody who's been to filly knows that's still that's still the the place where the rich people live around Philadelphia and he you know goes to a Ponzi you know private school for for Quaker boys on the grounds of a have a for college still there have a for the school I visited it while I was while I was in on the main line and quarterback to one of those guys yeah yep and he he joins up because it's 1898 the main has just been sunk or blown up depending on how you look at it and uh or blew itself up is the most the most likely right it was probably an accident on right well yeah they were storing ammunition and tremendous heat inside metal gun turrets yeah exactly it was it was America's it was one of America's first two steel battleships they didn't really know how to do it right and he's caught up in war fever it is very much you know for people my age I'm in my early 40s you know for for people my age is very reminiscent of 9 or less it was it was it was it was just you know America's been attacked by a dastardly empire and by the way Spain was a dastardly that's that's the tricky part it's not like you know Spain has to be rehabilitated here the Spanish Empire yeah wherever it went was just got awful yeah I mean in the same way like you don't have to rehabilitate al Qaeda and you don't have to rehabilitate so I was saying it's like there's there's many bad people in the world doing things in many different places yeah yeah um and and you know it was it was sort of that you know it was that it was a combination of um sort of the you know it was it was propaganda um but it's propaganda based on real things I mean the Spanish invented concentration camps in Cuba they were they were killing women and children they were torturing you know freedom fighters to death um and uh and Butler was reading about those things uh both in the Quaker and and the regular press um and then you know the main blows up and you know he his his line that he he says um later on in in his you know in his memoirs is you know I I was determined to to shoulder a rifle and help free little Cuba um it's a very paternalistic way of looking at it um I don't think the Cuban Mumbises were actually waiting for a 16 year old from West Jester Petzelvenia to come and free them um but he you know it was it was that that you know and and his parents you know support um that that help him sort of overcome you know the Quaker uh peace testimony um you know I I very fervent obviously famously um anti war stance uh to basically be like look I'm I'm you know I'm fighting on the side of the angels here I'm going to go I'm going to go help help these people um and that's what got him into the Marine Corps because the Marines were happy to have anybody they could get their hands on um and he just loved it so much that he stayed right I got to say there's a great quote here while we were on the subject of Cuba that you found of Jose Marti uh because he spent a couple years in exile in the US before going back you know trying to rally resources and support for the uh Cuban rebellion against the Spanish and he writes after having lived there he says I I lived inside the monster and I know it's guts about living in the US is a great quote yeah yeah by way of saying we better get this revolution won immediately he's that start setting up a government or the Americans are going to move in Castro riffs on on that um when he he when he's giving his uh defense at the at his trial um and I guess 1954 uh he he he describes uh uh Batista as it's something along the lines of um monster guignis de guerra tianan trineless like the the a monster that doesn't even have guts uh that's amazing it's kind of brutal that the CIA's um radio isn't it it was like the CIA's sort of radio free Cuba is called Jose Marti you know you mark radio marti yeah yeah well I mean he's like Mark T is marti is one of those figures who uh he's you know every anybody who believes in sort of a Cuba that should be independent from Spain um but you know is it believes sees themselves as the as the the air to marti so both Castro and and the anti Castro forces both think that they are the true that they're the true heirs to yeah one of the aspects of uh of butlers career by the way that first name it just keeps I don't mean it's like it's a weird thing in america like if somebody has a weird first name like that it means either they're very upper class or they're very uh rural lower class or something yes it's not a middle class thing to call you guys I actually ran this down I think figured out where it came from um it was it was basically and it was there's a name called smedley that is attested in the doomsday book the the register of medieval England places um the the original sort of tax book um and uh the town doesn't exist anymore I think it was in the midlands um but the assumption is that it it was probably a corruption of smithing it was probably like a town where smithing happened where like manufacturing happened um and then it became a last name and then in in high-wast tradition and also low-wast tradition that's used it uh it then it then works this way into um it's actually the diolington family it's actually butlers mothers family um as as a first name so I was gonna say that you know I we've been doing a civil war series and the marine corps has no major role in the civil war it's like they have gone by the end of the 19th century into real prominence and smedley butler is part of that prominence I assume that's part of the kind of wars that the US was fighting like you know when I when a client gives you trouble you send the gun boats but you also send the infantry in the form of the Marines exactly yeah they they grew up together um yeah the Marines you know famously uh if you go to marine ball they like to trace their their origins to the American Revolution really more technically it was John Adams who incorporates it in in the 1790s but as you say like they didn't have a big role because um you know they were basically shipguards like it was it was essentially you know in the 19th century when you know you would send a naval ship somewhere um to do a thing they were infantry on the ship and if you needed somebody to go on shore and and do an extra thing you sent in the Marines um and you know the number of things that the Marines did um uh of note in the 19th century were so few that they basically all made it into the song everybody get every boy plays everybody everybody gets a verse exactly it's the halls of autism that's the Mexican American war and the shores are tripled that's the barbaric that's it like those the only things that the Marines did so in the so in the so in the beginning of the 20th century what the Marines do is they really provide presidents starting with William McKinley this president during um the Spanish-American war but more importantly uh during the the the the invasion to crush the boxer rebellion uh in China in 1900 um what they give is essentially plausible than liability because if you send the marine excuse me if you send the army somewhere like it's very hard to make the case that you're not invading right if if if the army also wasn't particularly good at getting on boats and going other places that was that was that was why the Marines got into the fight in Cuba first um the reason why the Marines are first to shore at Guantanamo Bay which is ends up being Smelly Butler's first posting is because the Marines know how to pick up a gun get on a boat pick up the gun again and get off the boat like that's that's what they knew how to do and the army didn't really know how to do that because throughout the 19th century they had been fighting the civil war and and then the wars you know of ethnic cleansing against the you know the the Native Americans right which were mainly cavalry wars so it was like you know land-based infantry then cavalry and exactly there was there was no need for an amphibious force most of the time but but what the what the Marines give you um you know they they they they they are they are known in some quarters as you know as the state departments army or the state departments infantry what what they give you is the ability to you know project you know using a Navy ship far away and and then like I said you know have kind of plausible deniability it's like look we're not invading we're just sending we're just sending in a couple of Marines they're just you know they're just they're on the ground a few people or help by yeah yeah yeah this was something the European powers particularly Britain had had perfected throughout the course of the century if you if you look at the conquest of Burma for example it's like now we're just going to recover some deaths from a couple of our guys who got cheated and next thing you know they're occupying the capital so yeah exactly or or in Alexandria in Egypt and in in the 1880s which is where I smettlies extraordinarily racist mentor a little tin waller um it's it's that that was where he cut his teeth was that was that was that was again one of the one of the few uh it wasn't really of no it didn't make it into the song but yeah but the but the Marines came ashore in Egypt then and that was the same thing it was it was it was a deck collection mission and so and so that and and that's and that's what these wars that that butler is participating in um small wars you can call them um but from the from the from the it sort of depends on his perspective and the perspective of the people who are getting invaded it's just the war um uh you know when you see these guys coming over the hill it doesn't matter if they've got niggle globe and anchor or or you know army you know army sabers on like it's it's the same thing to them um but you know from but from the perspective of the United States it was it was cheaper easier quicker and and uh would get would would attract less attention um and and and afford more plausible than iability to send in the Marines and that really I mean you know one of the things that that is you know striking about about butler is that you know he's like he's far as scump he's everywhere but it's again it's it's not a some kind of superpower in his part it's because he's a Marine there aren't that many Marines and the Marines are everywhere yeah he's tremendously enthusiastic in the beginning isn't he I mean there's there's absolutely no trace of this uh this proto whistleblower at all that that I I see in your description of butler at as a 17 year old Marine no he's headstrong I mean he definitely is you know you you see the the elements personality wise to get to get to get a bit freidian on smetley um well to get really freidian about about him he's he really just seems to be obsessed with impressing his mother restates along the way I think you mentioned that in another era she might have gone out and joined up herself yeah she was she was she was that kind of you know jingo woman yeah um but yeah it's um uh you know he is you know like there's there's you know there's there's a quick spot in uh in i think it's in in the luzon chapter in the first philippines chapter uh where he writes her you know asking her to get his father who's a congressman and uh you know to to to to you know write the president or somebody who has power to basically you know get him you know move to a different post closer to the closer to the action he actually is at that moment asking for a transfer to the army because the army at that moment is is is closer to the front lines than then their marine unit happens to be um but uh you know so you see in that respect you know a guy who is is willing to uh rock the boat make trouble you know put himself a little bit at risk to get the thing that he wants and the thing that he thinks is is just and right um it just so happens that at that moment the things that he thinks is just and right is for him to be the best marine and the best you know best colonialist possible um you know he gets in as a true believer and and really the one thing that stays constant um throughout smelty butler's life is that he is a he threw out at every swing of the pendulum he is a true believer he is he he joy you know he's he's like Cuba should be free I'm gonna go fight for it myself um you know I I think that you know he in in in the 20s he gets into into prohibition after having been just a a an excessive drinker earlier in his life and and when he decides to go dry man does he go dry and he's like trying to ring up you know his friends in the Marine Corps on on court marshals for violating prohibition yeah you said he may makes until very unpopular in Philadelphia right by really smashing the taverns that's exactly it yeah he he yes so one of the things that he does is um you know he militarizes the Philadelphia police force by bringing these colonial tactics to it which are still things that we see in American police forces today um but he does it he does it unpoled unapologetically and not really caring who you know this more powerful than him uh get their toe stepped on so once he starts encountering basic you know he's he's there to smash vice he's there to smash the the gangsters but once he realizes that the gangsters the raccoteers this is where he gets the idea of raccoteer from um once he gets the idea that the raccoteers once once he realizes excuse me that the raccoteers are like incahutes with like these like leading you know republican politicians in in Philadelphia that he doesn't stop he just he just keeps going and ends up basically getting fired and and having to go back to to the Marine Corps because of it he he is somebody who at every at every point in his life when he gets an idea of what is just and right he goes for it and he does not care what the consequences are for himself and he doesn't really care what the consequences are for anybody right yeah yeah so i yeah that's one thing i was wondering about the book i was wondering if there's a particular moment where where empathy triumphs but it's it's not so much like that as we tell the story it's more like righteousness triumphs yeah i think that's right he you know the the thing you know the the the the full crumb of for me in at least in in in you know going through his letters which i spent a long time doing uh to the point that i became fluent in reading smettly's handwriting which was not an easy thing to do and all the v's and those you know that's it took it took yeah that took a lot of practice um is an nicaragua and the thing that the thing that happens in nicaragua there's a couple things that happen in nicaragua that that sort of you know provide this sort of jumping off point for him and this is in it starts in 1909 and then his last uh dance in nicaragua is in 1912 and two things are happening in nicaragua one is that um you know american colonialism uh it has has shed a lot of its pretense that it had been wearing for the last you know you know 12 14 years going back to the spanish american war in Cuba you could be like well you know we're fighting against you know spanish imperialism uh in in you that's also how the america is getting involved in the philippines um in in the box rebellion you can be like well you know we're defending missionaries and none of that's really true but like you can sort of you know pretend in what's happened in nicaragua is dollar diplomacy is now come into form and you know essentially the taft administration has decided look this war that we just fought in the philippines uh this is still going on in the southern paler provinces of of mndonau and the solar archipelago and the philippines at this point is extremely costly is extremely deadly and and it's it's garnering a lot of of backlash and and embarrassment in front of the american electorate instead of doing that let's do it financially let's go and you know control nicaragua by controlling its financial system will charter a central bank will will issue a new american run uh currency and will install a puppet president and we will use the marines because of their plausible deniability right and one thing is that that it's a lot harder to miss i mean as one of the details that i point out um is that during one of the invasions i think it's the 1912 butler bivouac half of his troops half of his marines in the us run central bank of of the irons because because because they're they're being because they're being guided into monoguina to the capital by the representative of the american banking houses uh brown brothers and jw selligman company um that that are running nicaraguan finances the other thing is on a more personal level that butler has just gotten promoted to major and because he is now a flag officer he is now able to travel a little bit more freely choose the people that he talks to before this he's really just you know a clicking heels twice or following orders um you know he's making decisions about sort of you know which you know which way to run up the hill if that but like he's really just going where he's told it's in nicaragua for the first time um that he's actually going around he's talking to the locals um he's you know he's he's realized you know he's he's meeting these you know wild wild cat american bankers who have who've come down to nicaragua um to to to make their their small fortunes and he's realizing that like you know i don't think that i don't think that we're doing the things that i was told that we were doing and it's and it's so so so it's from that point on and you know this is one of the things that you know i i i i i i don't mean this to be in any way an a an a absolution for him because most of the worst things that he does militarily in his career come after this right that everything he doesn't both of his medals of honor um uh the the you know everything he doesn't hate he all of that comes after um this experience in nicaragua but but nonetheless you know he is perhaps starting to to to to garner uh uh maybe a small sense of empathy for for the people um who you know as as he says you know um in nicaragua you know the you know the poor people will will be the ones who suffer and their blood will be on our heads there's there's there's some traces of that kind of empathy but it's really is really well sentenced and getting cynical right i mean no way you can sense in his lose letters you quote that he's starting to just see through the bullshit and yeah and like writing home about it so that yeah he eventually writes uh yeah his description in that famous paragraph which is usually the one thing of of his book that gets quoted yeah uh i help purify nicaragua for the international banking house of brown brothers uh i brought light oh he's getting yeah he's getting bitter here i brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests right yeah yeah yeah yeah the stories i mean it's it's a you know it's a grim if you're American maybe if you're not as well it's it's it's pretty depressing stuff um because it's just sort of example after example i mean i don't know if uh so you're a little bit younger than i am i mean um for many frustrating years you couldn't really say for example something like america's obviously an empire in in like polite company you'd be again a conspiracy theorist or a you know fringer or whatever i don't know there's sort of two ways i'd want to approach but one of them is just intellectually like um you know it's it's just a fact like wake you don't i mean just like get out of this sort of fairytale world it's just it's a simple grim fact it's not the same kind of empire it doesn't have legions of romans with big you know brush helmets brushes on their helmets or british helmets or it operates it looks a bit different it has different trappings but of course it's an empire and it's one of the really good things about your book without being overly polemical in any way you're just describing how that empire functions again through this thread of this character smetley botler and he sees it too and and of course you'd really have to have i mean i imagine most people involved in the guts of that understand that that that's just you know that's how it is and they justify it to themselves well it's how it is or they wouldn't justify it to themselves they they back out of it but like let's let's go through a couple of these stories i mean it's really interesting and i don't know relevant or you know ironic whatever you'd say that butlers first overseas deployment is literally to guantanamo bay i mean that's where first lands um which is synonymous with like everything that went wrong or bad let's say everything bad about the war in terad you know from whose point of view it's wrong it's another question right but uh let's his experience like i guess if you could just briefly sum it up uh in um in the spanish-american war uh there in Cuba and then in uh and then we'll go to the philippines yeah i was gonna say i mean the theater of of the spanish-american war um that that he really sees combat in that he really does more things in is in in the philippines right by the time he gets to guantanamo um the marines had taken it a couple weeks earlier um the big battle which is the battle of kusco well um had had already been fought um and and the spanish and basic with with the with the assistance of not even the assistance the leadership of right of the of the Cuban mumbises by the way it's a good little war i mean you are it it's people like to read war stories also they just think yeah and then the Cubans get uh white washed out well yeah very much white washed out of out of the story but they're the ones who figure out there's only one well in this area yeah the spanish troops depend for their water on that well if we can take the well they got to leave uh and and they're the ones who do it starts off with friendly fire yeah and this guy who runs up to a hill semi-foring or something like yeah or too quick so quick quick yeah yeah it's a great story by the way um yeah it's no that that that's um uh yeah and i just want to note it was steven crane of the author of the red branch of courage he does sort of the initial whitewashing he's he's he's a course monitor there for jesus pollitzer yeah yeah i got to say um when we were doing the civil war series uh red badge of courage and it doesn't quite make the cut it's not it's not that good i feel better about that now after reading it too i mean that that was uh he does not come off well there and that's not at all yeah real jerk um right so um so uh so he lands in guantan but already the battle there has already happened but he thinks he's gonna get into some battles there yeah so so what what he's what he's doing there is he's he's basically patrolling the perimeter right um and uh and he's he's getting uh tutored into into marine manhood is essentially what he does and getting sick getting getting getting getting some right mosquito poor illness um which was the fate of a lot of people in yeah yeah yeah he gets sick a lot throughout your book yeah yeah ten fifteen years one of the thing i've had also several mosquito-porting illnesses so i really so i yeah so i i that was there were many things that i identified with smelty bullarn that was what what uh which ones did you have i've had dengue i've had uh i got zika um damn that wasn't a fun one um dengue was actually the worst dengue dengue i think i've heard uh kind of heard an aqua wood i think the sickest i've and i had cove you know it's like everybody has been like yeah i further with dengue you you get these spasms that are like yeah why they call it break bone fever yep wow i don't recommend it that is my podcast recommendation if you take anything away right and uh anyway so then then the us also right around the time decides uh hey the Philippines because really the us this is one of the you know a a a a thread that comes up or a theme that comes up a few times in your book a lot of the us commercial interests are always sort of like um are thinking very deeply about china and access to china markets and controlling shipping lanes i mean it's it's not anything new among the sort of ruling class in this country that the eternal dream yeah the eternal dream you look you say oh my god there's a 1.6 billion people if i could sell this app so 45 percent of them i could retire people yeah because the British empire it already sold them the ultimate app exactly right truly addictive little app yep yep yep and uh and a lot of americans made money off of that as as well as i yeah yeah yes including including the founders of a number of american political dynasties right the the forces in the delinus yeah yeah yeah so uh describe for our listeners we could briefly like he goes to the Philippines to lose on he's there he arrives after i think um the us has already taken manela if i remember right right right he yes he gets there he gets there in uh in 1899 um so so i mean but basically what's happened is i mean basically the first act of the war so the americans are fighting alongside just like in cuba where we're fighting alongside the Cubans we're fighting alongside the the Filipinos and just like in cuba we then immediately betray them once once the Spanish are defeated um and so the so the first act really of what becomes the filipino-american war um is the americans essentially colluding with the spanish to surrender the city of manela to the americans so that the so that the spanish didn't have to have the disgrace of of of of surrendering their city to to you know the local malay population um they they felt much more comfortable surrendering it to a white power like they were and i also want to know just in terms of like historical deniolism one thing that's interesting is that again you see this everywhere including at the spanish empire um you know i mean this like the the spanish empire which is like what what what empire is more of an empire than the spanish empire right they refuse to call their colonial possessions colonies basically until the bourbon reforms like throughout the the you know the first uh uh couple centuries of of spanish rule over uh both the americans and and the filipines it was always the kingdom of peru the kingdom of of of of Mexico you know the audience of of the filipines um you know they also were like we're just here to help we're just here to give you guys catholicism and like you know yeah sure we'll take we'll take a bunch of gold and money and silver off the back end um so you know they're you know again there's bad people everywhere um but but yes so so the americans have taken um uh manela uh and you know the the filipinos who believed that the americans were going to essentially do for them what what the French what Lafayette did for the americans in in the american revolution um are horrified and betrayed and they uh uh the first shot is is fired by an american but a war breaks out between between the americans and the filipinos um and butler uh is is basically part of um a a reinforcement brigade uh battalion um not brigade battalion uh this is the war nerd post-pig as i should i need to get these exactly um because they're they're federalized infantry um at that point uh the army is still sort of in its 19th century formation uh of you know essentially you know state volunteer forces and you know each each governors has you know some control over over you know the troops that get sent uh in congresses ultimately has has the authority um but the president has the the direct authority over the marines because they're marine infantry and the navy is it it was you know already fully federalized um because it had to be because it was both going into the ocean right no no one's taking f control over that so um so yeah it can be basically sends in a bunch of marine reinforcements um and that includes bottler and that's that's where bottler ceases first action uh in in the battle of novelleta um i thought this was really interesting here that and i i can very much see it and understand it very sad and interesting that um what you got into how filipinos i mean the filipinos had a very brutal and bitter experience with american colonialism um the the various uh insurgency and well the counterinsurgency campaigns wage by the us killed uh you know three quarters of a million or more filipinos and we're talking a century ago so proportionally you know that would be millions by today's standards and um i mean you have a quote here people here don't ask questions about the past and uh the manufacturing of amnesia it's sort of like um it's too painful it's also shameful underneath it all there's also this set this kind of sad desire to still sort of believe that something you know that there could be something good with the us i think in a lot of people as well i don't know but um it was if you could talk about a little bit of that all like what you what you saw personally when going out there because you have three chapters on the filipines um the most brutal one being some more i think uh and the whole battle yeah yeah yeah so yeah bullard ends up coming back um and it's posted at subek bay um a couple of years later and then in between is is the is the episode on on on samar um which is um yeah as you say it's it's it's it's absolutely horrific chapter bullard is not participating personally involved in that one but but his his fellow marines including his is extremely racist mentor um little to waller uh plays plays basically the starting role on that but butler would have been there if he hadn't basically contracted yet another disease typhoid in china uh during during uh uh the operation just before that um but yeah i mean filipino historical memory is um the historical memories of all these countries that but i went to is fascinating and just like ours um there's no there's no pure unadulterated historical memory out there i mean sometimes people like look at other countries overseas and imagine like oh you know we we are we are the corrupted adults and they're the pure children who are just talking about their their their their their innocent experiences and this isn't the case right everybody's everybody's mediating their historical memory through path events that have happened between now and then the needs of the past the needs of the present um what they want to believe about themselves and in the philippines um you know talking about anything that happened in the early 20th century requires you have to you have to wind your way through the crucible of world war two uh which as big a deal as it was uh in the rest of the united states right because the philippines was part of the united states during that war throughout that war um it was much i mean you know in the united states it was ultimately a foreign war from from the perspective of the metropole of the mainland in the philippines it happened to them i mean the the manoevo at the end of that war was the second worst bomb city in the world after after war so i was it was completely obliterated um and because of the experience of people who are you know a generation that is now dying out um uh under Japanese imperialism and having fought with the americans to extricate the japanese and then the americans extremely helpfully give them their long belated independence in 1946 the year after the war ends manila is literally in rubble and uh harry truman is like good luck thanks for your service have a good time um and uh and and so that that that that that that's part of that's part of i think what makes it more complicated um looking back also because throughout the cold war um and since uh you know the philippines remains a ally client partner junior partner um in the american empire which you know for philippino elites um for people who are you know profiting you know in in the towns you know next to um these big usbases including subeck bay which of course smithly butler helps set up um and clerk air force base which is one of the the big uh air bases right next to subeck um which we also abandoned one there in ruins uh in the aftermath of the eruption of map pittituba 1991 but so what i'm trying to say is that all of like through all through that whole period um throughout the marcos dictatorship and by the way a marcos is now president of of philippines again um you know it is well that's that's kind of a remarkable episode of uh the ephemeral quality of historical memory there like okay so dad wasn't so great let's try again exactly well it's it's it's complicated like everything right and so and so what's happening in all of these things is that that you know anytime you know the the the thing that a lot of people miss um in unders in trying to understand how the world works and how the united states operates in the world is that they they they they don't have an analysis of power they don't have an analysis of the fact that the united states is the big powerful nuclear arm to the teeth country that is coming in and and they're destroying everything that gets in its way and also you know keeping a a ready supply of allies and clients um you know in you know to to help serve it's it's you know larger global foreign policy goals and for anybody who has been on the wrong end of that and philippines has been on both sides of that right the philippines was conquered um they were they were they were you know they ran roughshot over and colonized for half a century um they end up being a you know the the the reason that the Japanese invade the philippines um it's partially because you know they just want the land of the philippines and sort of a you know a leban's rom kind of you know sense of a a place to grow food but it's also a power play it's because that's an american colony the Japanese and the americans are are fighting each other really over control of the pacific rim and really with the goal both of their goals is to be the dominant power that controls china right that that eternal dream that eternal market um and and that and and so that you know the as as the as the what's that the the rwandan saying I forget it's it's some east african saying that you know when the elephants fight uh you know the grass gets trampled right it's the you know the philippinos are are the grass in that instance as well but and then they see themselves they're they're then in between the united states and its new rival empire after the war in the soviet union um and and subich bay and and and and carcass force base end up being uh you know major uh a forward operating bases to threaten and control the soviets and the soviet sphere of influence and and they're afraid that again you know if if they if they if they if they piss off the americans and are left to to to to be trampled that they're going to have the same thing happened that the sovets are going to do the same thing to them that the japanese did um or they don't exactly know how but it's not going to turn out well right and then you have people who have their own sort of you know grift grift in the game and so because of all of that there are all these good reasons to uh from from an elite standpoint to downplay american colonialism and you know america's brutal past in the philippines and it doesn't hurt that the older generations during the cold war um and even some of the oldest people who are alive today grew up in an american school system that of course overtly erased the histories of american colonialism so in some of these cases you don't even really have to forget it because you don't have a a a a good grasp of it uh a good educational background in it you have maybe the stories that you've heard from your parents or your grandparents you have little bits of of of cultural memory that have sort of filtered down to you um but the process of forgetting becomes easier which is why it was so interesting when i was there you know the the reporting that i did for the book i was there in in 2017 so as before the new marcos came in when when where he goes to terte was was president right and to terte was he was playing his own game yeah where he was trying to reposition the philippines uh away from the increasingly unreliable united states which at that point was run by Donald trump toward china and jisium ping because they again the philippines has this this eternal uh memory of being caught in the middle between competing empires and they see themselves again being caught between uh the united states and china so the two things you can do are either you can go all in and say yes i am totally in bed with one of these two empires you know put all the armaments that you want here uh put all the controls that you want here i'm with you uh i'm with you leather or um or you know try to sort of play them off each other and be like well maybe you guys can give me this and maybe you can give me this and that was de terte's tact and because because of that and because de terte's own personal uh uh you know outlook on life um uh and and is is is is just sort of inherent uh trolling nature um he was starting to excavate some of these you know memories and some of these histories of the philippine american war um at is at the same time that that a new generation of philippinos uh raised on the internet with access to information that their parents and grandparents had either suppressed or did have access to he threatened to show photos right yeah that was so interesting i mean because you know you normally identify anti imperialism i think at least in the west we do you know with with a left wing or Marxist inspired nationalist movement but here you have this um i don't know demagogue i mean it's hard to say what his politics are they're kind of all over the place but you know violent demagoguery guess some in some way um but and and it's like all you almost had to do was sort of threatened to rip the band-aid a little bit and it just it's it was um he didn't he didn't go all the way there he just sort of threatened it and that enough seemed to have power which is yeah so interesting um yeah i mean anti-perialism from the from the perspective of a colony or a former colony often takes the form of revanche nationalism because you because the alternative to the empire is you personally ruling and and you do have these past wrongs um that you can that you can we have alch yeah legitimize yourself yeah so let's um uh let's let's go to i mean look a lot of these stories you you know you you follow him through uh you know central america panema and nicaragua and um variculous and you know mexico and they're i i got to say they're all just they're as they accumulate they're very depressing sad stories they're they're mostly just you know massacres of small or large size in the service of um business i mean it's basically what he said it's it's grim and it's sad um at Haiti in a way is kind of the biggest grimest most gruesome story of of all those i mean they're all pretty grim but uh um you know in Haiti um i mean Haiti's just suffered more than any other country in it it's uh in this hemisphere probably and it's it's just it's just gruesome but um one thing i wanted to just read out holandosek here is where um i mean butlers butlers imprint there is is just everywhere even like as you describe even in the way the roads are set up you know but learn american imperialisms which to this day all the all the roads they don't they don't lead to each other and in the various cities they all just lead to port of prince because that that's what served the us interests um one of the you know most incredible episodes is when um the Haitians are gonna prove a new constitution and what the US wants is that this constitution is going to allow foreigners to by land and because of Haiti's you know horrific history um as a colony as a slave colony um that's sort of as a red line for just about anybody even people on the take and so the the congress finally says no we can't pass that and so butler just shows up with marines and bayonets and says you're dissolved and there's no more democracy and um and and you have this line here i mean i have to say this like that this episode i just hadn't seen it sort of described like this before i i guess and so it is kind of it's you know it does kind of hit you and um so you know Haiti's legislature was dissolved it would not meet again for another 12 years here's what you write power butler knew depended not only on violence but also on the control of information if word got out of the marines role in the shattering of parliament Haitians would be scandalized so we summon the editors of all the national papers to agendarmory headquarters where they were ordered not to publish any details and later that day according to commission and butler had the records of the assemblies last votes removed from the parliamentary archives so i'm so i mean that direct role in it it was just erased um yeah from history it's uh it's pretty scary i mean you know it's and we probably it's unusual for a uh colonist of that era most of them were very ill-advisately boastful people but that's more in the Anglo-Saxon tradition maybe in part it was because he had because he was starting to open his eyes a little bit and was starting to feel a little bit of empathy um that in some ways made him and even more uh dangerous tool of empire was because and that's something that we see a lot that's a good point yeah the other thing that he's doing in in Haiti at that time is is is he and his marines are are their field notes in in crushing the the insurgency that known as the Kakos in northern Haiti the their field notes become the basis for the small wars manual right which which then becomes the the basis of counter insurgency doctrine um and and in a lot of ways i mean i make this argument um the the reason why butler was so um effective as a marine and as a war fighter in Haiti was because he was a little bit less racist uh than his superiors he was able to see the Haitians as people with feelings um which then made it possible for him to then manipulate this feeling yeah um yeah that's that that's that's that's all very true yeah i mean look in a lot of ways um you know gangsters is a book about historical memory um and that moment in the Haitian parliamentary archives where he's where he's destroying the records um is that's a moment of of the suppression of of memory of of of history um and and one of the things that i was thinking about like as i was writing that is you know the only reason the reason why we know that this happened is because um the head of the Haitian senate a guy named stenio vensang who ends up becoming president of Haiti is actually the president of Haiti when the americans withdraw under frank ladon was about 1934 but in the 1920s um so wasraelson a democratic president is uh empowered during the invasion of Haiti power changes hands in the united states uh now the republicans are in charge and the republicans uh you know hold a series of of hearings about american abuses in a Haiti and and and the Dominican Republic something to mingo and it's at that hearing basically stenio vensang uh uh has come to testify um he's been working i believe with uh the end of lacp which also played a major role in in opposing the u.s occupation um and so it's only because he he tells congress uh what had happened um that there's any real you know there's only real record of it uh you know contemporaneous record and and butler also is called to testify um and you know he doesn't he doesn't deny any of this because it's what happened and at that point you know from from his standpoint from the american standpoint uh the the horse has long since left the barn it's yeah it's 1921 all this stuff happened in 1917 and i'm sure we can talk about it now um you know but think about all the things that that didn't happen for you know all all the all the all the all the episodes of of uh american imperialism um you know they did have the records destroyed or that nobody bothered to write down um or or that that you know everybody sort of you know uh uh uh swore uh you know it kind of a pack of america or even that the colonized people like we were just talking about the philippines um you know that they felt a need to suppress it themselves for for you know for their own either personal or or or national goals um you know who knows what else is out there um that is that is that is waiting to be discovered or or uncovered um but that was that was the british empire here right John i mean it's yeah well a lot of the things at the bottom of the indian ocean yeah i mean the the the carol and elkins book on the pinya we had no idea you know she just happened to basically you know taped together and torn up document you know more or less and found out that the british put the entire cacui population in concentration camps and tortured and murdered god knows how many tens of thousands in the fifties you know when we had tv and no one knew about it you know and they they burned they thought they burned everything but she found some stuff it's pretty scary to think how much we don't know yeah but anyway british are another example of like you know americans often americans who object to the imperial label uh to describe ourselves often say well you know we're not a real empire like the british but the british are all the british also engaged in in generations of of denialism right um and if you go you know if you're growing up in in in british schools people have passed through them it's like you don't you don't learn they don't they don't they don't teach this stuff uh we built some railroads and gave them democracy what's the problem here yeah we built beautiful train stations in india they're gorgeous what do you want yeah exactly yeah i think we should leave it there i mean i well all we can do is tell people get the book it's a brilliant book and it really is really well written it's a great structure like the whole thing it's it's it's really well done good gift you know for the holidays um but uh find it for the your favorite capitalist imperial yeah it's right um okay well thank you so much john nathan cats for uh for joining us we'll put links to his books and uh to his newsletter um the racket dot news
