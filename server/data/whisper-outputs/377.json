    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. The day today is May 9th, the E Day. This is episode 377. You're listening to Radio Warner. Subscribe at patreon.com-radio-warnard. I'm the Ghost Mark Games up here in western New York on Lake Ontario. And I'm online with the Warner Gary Betray, John Dolan in Pouliah, Italy. John Areo. I'm all right. I'm somewhere in Pouliah. I'm not clear on it myself. And it would take too long to explain. And so we should probably just get to our interview because we get a great interview. Yes. We have a great interview with James Bamford, one of my very favorite journalists. And he has another just amazing book out. Spy Fail. I can't recommend it enough. And we have a great interview. So I don't even want to do any more introduction. I just want to get to it, get to the interview. And I think you're really going to like it. Okay. We have with us great guest. Very excited to have him in a fan of his work for many years now. James Bamford. He has a new book out. Spy Fail. Foreign Spies, Moles, Sabotors, and the collapse of America's counterintelligence. It's put out through 12 books, has shed. But he's known as the best selling author of, really probably the first real book on the NSA that at least went deep into the NSA, the puzzle palace, as well as body of secrets. And the shadow factory, the ultra-seeked NSA from 9-11 to the Eves dropping on America. So anyway, first of all, welcome to the show. Thanks for joining us. No, thanks Mark. Appreciate it. If I remember right now, it was body of secrets that had the chapter on the USS Liberty. Yeah. I had some in the puzzle palace also, but the large section was in body of secrets. And body of secrets mentioned that the Liberty was bombed and strafed in part to cover up a massacre of Egyptian prisoners. Yeah. So that was one possibility. I mean, there were lots of potential things to cover up. Right. Right. But it's a pretty intense chapter. And I have to say, it made a lasting impression on me. And part of that impression is, how is it that this story doesn't get told elsewhere? Which is like a lot of the stuff you write about. Yeah. So before we get it, which kind of segues to the first question I really wanted to get to you asked you, because before we get to your new book and all, which is a bit about your background as a journalist. I mean, I think a lot of listeners are interested in journalism and how somebody can carve out a career and write and publish stuff that, you know, powerful people don't want to read. I mean, we talk a lot on this show about hacks and propaganda and so on. So it's great to have a writer like you on a journalist like you on. Could you give us some background about your own career and how you got to where you are? I was in the Navy for three years during Vietnam. And when I got out, I had the GI bill. I went to law school and never really was into the law that much, but I had a free education. And so the only part of the law I was interested was criminal law. But I really wanted to be a writer, although, you know, how do you become a writer? So I was looking around. Nobody had ever done a book on NSA. I learned about NSA when I was in the Navy. And I was fascinated by, I was always really fascinated by NSA. So there have been a few books on the CIA and I thought, well, I'll do a book on the NSA. So I was always good at research. I was in the law library. I actually worked in the law library part time in law school. So I was good at research and turned that into doing research on NSA. I spent three years doing hardcore research looking places. Nobody else had been interviewing people. Nobody else had ever interviewed. And that's how the puzzle palace came about. What sort of work did you do at ABC and how long were you there for? I spent a decade pretty much the entire 1990s with, I was the investigative producer for the CIA. I was the investigative producer for Peter Jennings World News tonight. So I did all the international, I was everywhere, war zones and all that kind of stuff. And, you know, covering terrorism and espionage and so forth. It was really a fun time. But towards the end of the 90s television started going downhill. And I decided that my publisher wanted me to do a new book. I think well to puzzle palace. So that sounded more appealing to me and I jumped ship and began writing again. Do you miss TV at all or? Well, actually, I ended up becoming a filmmaker for documentaries on PBS. I did a number of documentaries for PBS on NSA 911. One called Astros Fies and other on. What I try to do is combine the science and intelligence to do these documentaries. So my career has been sort of half of television and half in writing. Okay. All right. Yeah, I mean, that's interesting. You said that how TV journalism went downhill. It sort of went over a cliff sometime around the mid 90s on. It seems like. Yeah, where you were you have in a hard time like getting interesting stories out there. Well, I got hired in 1989 and it was at the peak. Everything was, you know, it was sort of a golden time for TV news. In the mid 1990s, ABC got popped by Disney and things started to change. We started closing overseas bureaus and then Fox came along. And then there was this push to get soft news. You know, how far does your dollar go every night or something like, you know, there's a lot of, I mean, there's only 22 minutes for a newscast. Anyway, it's basically just headlights. I was lucky I was the investigator guy. So I got to do, you know, three or four minutes, which is like a norm as luxury on television. But then, you know, it started just going downhill and we were competing with places that in particular like, like Fox news. And so I, you know, and it was. I liked writing and then I began writing. Do a bunch of things to document it for PBS, writing a new book and writing articles. I had a question about, you know, how, how you're reporting effects sourcing because when you're reporting on the NSA in particular, or kind of intelligence for that matter. I mean, these are, you know, really the most secretive corners of a government. They don't like anything out there on them. If I remember right, the NSA's existence wasn't even like very officially acknowledged until like the 70s or so. And so I'm just wondering if, you know, given the fact that your books, you're very, a common theme in your books. Done in different ways is, is betrayals betray all by the government. Personal betrayals in your new book, which are just amazing stories as well as, you know, larger betrayals. So I'm just wondering, you know, how you're reporting how the, how your previous books. You know, puzzle pal, his body of secrets. Has it opened up doors as much as it's got doors closed on your face or like sort of how is that worked with your sourcing basically. Well, the people that aren't going to talk to me aren't going to talk to me anyway. So the books actually have a multiplier effect. They actually help me because I'll talk to say I talk to 30 people or something. I'll talk to those 30 people will have people that will call them and they say they'll say, oh, I liked it. I mean, the people, they'll have people saying I didn't like it and then. I don't hear from them, but they'll be have people that will call them and say, oh, I liked it. And then the person will call me back and say, you know, Bill or Jane or whatever said they liked it and you they'd be happy to talk to you or something like that. So they it seems to have a multiplier effect. I mean, there are not, you know, there aren't a lot. We're not talking hundreds and hundreds of people here, but we're trying. You know, because as you mentioned, I do write about very sensitive topics, which is the how I started in this whole business. I would imagine that that for some sources, especially dealing with politicized heads of intelligence agencies. There's a lot of pent up well rage that, you know, might get channeled into interviews. Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, my first book, the puzzle palace. I had the government twice tried to or threaten me with prosecution. They did. This isn't the. Yeah, for the puzzle palace. Yeah, they threaten me twice with the violation of the espionage. I believe. Wow, that's amazing. We were just talking about that on the show with, you know, regarding Jack to share and going back to what Bill Casey and Reagan's people were trying to do in the 80s to stop leaks and they were going after everybody. We're trying to then, but yeah, go ahead. Tell us the story. I'm really curious about this. Just to go back for a minute. There was a church committee. And then the church committee was set up by the Congress to look into the intelligence community. The Ford administration wanted to look like they were doing the same thing like we're taking the series to they set up a thing called the Rockefeller commission, which also looked into to the intelligence community. Right. And so when the church can be ended being a congressional committee, they just put their they had hearings and they just put the report in the drawer basically. But the Rockefeller commission was federally created. So when they finished, they turned their report over to the Justice Department. And there were a lot of allegations in there about the NSA is doing illegal spying. So now it's in the Justice Department and the Justice Department had to do an investigation. They did a very, very secret investigation into NSA to illegal spying. And they came out with like 20 charges that they can bring against people at the agency for illegal spying. All this was totally secret. Nobody knew anything about that. So I heard about it. I sent an FOI request to Justice Department asking for it just sort of out of the blue. And about nine months later, they sent it to me. And it was fairly lightly redacted, which I was surprised at. And it had all these allegations that they told, told all about what NSA was doing illegally in terms of spying. And it was a very good basis for parts of my book. Was this spying on American sort of war critics and Congress people even, right? Well, it was spying on Americans. It wasn't, I don't see any young Congress, but it was, it was a lot of spying on Americans. And the other thing it was a show cooperation between GCHQ, the British, the global and NSA, and NSA at the time, that was extremely secret. Right. Why, I don't know, but it was. So, so that was very secret. So anyway, the, I use material. And at the same time, I actually did have a somewhat of a relationship with NSA. I'd go up there maybe once every month or so. And meet with my contact and just say, can't you release this to me? Can't you let me interview this person or whatever? And so I figured, you know, since I got this document, the NSA must have approved it. So I went up there with the document and I said, well, there's all this stuff on this project and this project, since it's already been released, why don't you release a more to me or something like that. And the guy's eyes got really wide like he'd never seen it before. And he said, where did you get that? And I got it from the Justice Department, you know, the Attorney General released it to me under the Free Information Act. And then what happened behind the scenes was the head of NSA, Bobby Iman, went to the Attorney General, who was, who was it? I forgot who it was at the time. He was under car. Oh, under car. No, it was under car. At the time it was, uh, anyway, so he, he went to him and I basically says, well, I'm the guy that released it if you don't remember. So I'm not going to pull it back. And so they didn't. But then we in French Smith came in a little while later under the Reagan administration. Right. Carter left Reagan came in William French Smith became the Attorney General and William French Smith went along with NSA and they demanded that I give the document back. Again, this is three Internet days. You can't just, you know, I mean, I had the copy. I made one extra copy that I sent to somebody outside the country secretly. So some happened to me. Yeah. I was going to get out. Yeah. Anyways, I refused to give it back. And then they got very nasty. They said, well, you know, we want you to come down to meet with the Justice Department. You know, I thought they were going to probably charge me or something. And so I got a lawyer and we went down there and they filled me in on the whole thing, which was very interesting. You know, how it shouldn't have been released and blah, blah, blah. Now, will I please give it back and you know, but I really enjoyed this. They were really telling me a lot of things. And so I wanted to keep it going. So I said, well, you know, I got to think about this. But we really need one more meeting at least. And so they said, OK, OK. And I said, well, you know, I came all the way down to Washington for this meeting. So, you know, maybe you got to come up to Boston for the next meeting. And just so they did. I had it in my publisher's office and in Boston. And they came up. There were three of them. The chief counsel for NSA, the head of policy for NSA and the deputy assistant attorney general under the National Security Division. And so, you know, I thought, OK, now I'm just going to hear more about how they shouldn't have released it or whatever, but they got very angry at first. And they said, first of all, we want to know how many copies you've made, who you've given copies to, who still has those copies. And I said, wait, wait, wait. My lawyer wasn't there. He was still in Washington because he wasn't able to come up. And so I said, look, you know, you're asking me questions that we didn't aren't on the agenda. I'm going to have to call my lawyer in Washington. And then you're going to have to talk to him. And if he says, OK, I'll answer the question. So I called him. It was Mark Lynch with the ACLU. So Mark said, let me get on the phone with them. So I put the deputy assistant attorney general or whatever on there. And it wasn't going good. I get here. He's bringing up all these laws and everything. So Mark said, look, put the phone down on its side. Let me speak to Bamford alone. And you wait outside the door. So that happened. I picked up the phone and Mark said, look, I don't know what the goddamn pocket, but they may have arrest warrant for you. Wow. So Peter or something, you know, some document. So my advice is put the phone back down on its side. Go out and tell him, I want to talk to them again. And as they walk in, you disappear. That's great lawyer advice. Good for him. Yeah, so I did. I sort of went up and hid my editor's office. And they didn't know I wasn't coming back. So they're waiting and waiting like after 20 minutes or half an hour, they just get up and leave and they're finding their way out of the building because there was nobody else there from hoping to come. And they make their way back the airport and fly back. And they're really pissed. So they sent me a letter saying, you are currently in possession of classified documents. We demand the return. And there's all these espionage laws. And there is a part of the espionage law that says, if you come into possession of classified documents, not that you stole them, but if you come into possession of them and refuse to return them to the proper custodian, you could be charged under the espionage law. So that's what they threatened me with twice. And I, both times, I refused to turn them and then they eventually went away. But you know, it was hairy for a while there. Well, it would be a pretty good defense. I would think like, well, I filed for an FOI and you sent them to me. And that's how I came into possession. That's what we sent the letterback saying, well, you know, excuse me, but it was the Attorney General of the United States, the head of the Justice Department that you're saying is going to prosecute me, that released them to me in the first place. That's a crazy story. So, all right. So let's get to the current book. I guess first of all, you know, we'll get to this in a second. I mean, you started off with just amazing story about North Korea and this crap movie, the interview in Seth Rogen and how this like all almost led to nuclear war. So it's, I mean, it's a really, it's grotesque and wild. It's pretty damn funny unintentionally. Much funnier than the movie itself, I guess. But I guess that my first question is, because you have a sort of series of stories that all kind of interconnect, one inspired you to write this particular book and, you know, and how did you put it together? Because this isn't just about, you know, really, this isn't just about the NSA. Well, first of all, the thing called the pandemic came along. So it sort of limited my ability to do a lot of things that I was doing. Documentaries are pretty much out and all kinds of things like that. So I just had a good time writing a new book. All my previous books have pretty much been on what the United States is doing to American citizens. So what they're doing in terms of ease dropping the war, Iraq war, all that kind of thing. So this time I thought I'd look at what other countries are doing to us. And because I'd never done that and they really had been a book on, at least not a really serious book on, on counterintelligence. Right. How the government's protecting us from foreign spies and moles and saboteurs, you know, on the title of the book there. So that's why I decided to look into that. And, you know, it was pretty much very interesting, as you can see from the stories I write about, because they evolve extraordinarily interesting characters. Yes. And extraordinarily damaging leaks and so forth. I mean, I was the first person to go to Moscow, an interview at Snowden, spent three days hanging out with him. Right. And so, you know, I know how he got all those documents out and so forth, but he did it in a cheerful way so that, you know, he put Laura Poitris and Glenn Greenwald as a buffer between the documents and the public so that he didn't release really anything on Russians or Chinese and things like that. But then these other leaks were just, you know, horrendous leaks that led to cyber pandemics and everything else. So I thought that would be fascinating to look into how all that happened. Yeah. And Hollywood is at the center. Another just great thread. I don't recall you having written about Hollywood before, but Hollywood is front and center in this story, which makes it extra grotesque and funny and wild. And we've heard in the past about CIA and Pentagon influence on Hollywood movies, but this is from a different angle and it makes so much sense too. I mean, basically, you know, secret out of that focusing on this incredible character. This is really Arnon Milchian, who is a major, it's such a crazy story. I don't know where to begin with this. This is what really struck me. I was wondering, am I just out of it? And some of the movies he's produced are incredibly well known and successful. He's worth $4 billion. I would expect to know about this guy. And I didn't know anything about him. Neither did I. Well, I had the same reaction. Exactly the same reaction. I sort of came across him sideways, I was looking into something else, and then he came into my radar and looked very interesting. And I'd heard about him before once or twice, and there's 60 minutes, it's sort of a stupid, puff piece on him. And, you know, so he went, well, I mean, we had again to what the story is before I started talking about it, I guess. It's an amazing story. No matter how much you hear now, like you got to buy the book to really get, you know, the full sense of this story. But if you could give some background on Arnold Milchon. Yeah, it's a very long story. It starts in the mid 60s, Arnold Milchon. He's in Israeli. He came from a very wealthy family. It's by the left of him a lot of money, including a big business with offices around the world. And he was in his 20s, so he was in Tel Aviv. He met a few different people. We got introduced to the Israeli intelligence, a special intelligence focused on nuclear weapons and so forth. At the time, Israel was building nuclear, in the early stages of building nuclear, a nuclear processes to D'Amona for creating a fuel for nuclear weapons and so forth. So they were on the road of making nuclear weapons, and they had this special intelligence organization focused just on acquiring material for the weapons program and keeping the weapons program secret. And so it was called Luchum. And Milchon got hired for that. And he started doing work for them. At the same time around that time, or in the early 70s and so forth, the Israelis became very close to apartheid South Africa. I mean, Israel long had apartheid with the Palestinians. And so they got along very well with the apartheid South Africans, and their treatment of the blacks down there. So they became the top arms dealer for the South Africans during apartheid. And Milchon became the top arms dealer for the South African government during apartheid. And when the UN put an embargo on South Africa for no country to send arms to it, only Israel agreed to do it. They did it basically secretly. And Milchon became the top arms dealer selling weapons so they can abuse and do horrible things to the black population. So he became a top arms dealer. He made millions and millions of millions of dollars doing that. And then he became the top prop, or one of the top propagandists for the South African apartheid government, pushing apartheid around the world, saying, you know, it didn't really that bad. We're doing, you know, the blacks really like this. I mean, that was their message. And so then they wanted to bring it to the next. This is a huge project, right? I mean, this was considered a top priority project for the apartheid regime. Oh, sure. Yeah. Because they were, you know, they were having embargoes and everything else. And they were, you know, disrespected all over the world. So they wanted to increase, and they had a quite a bit of money. So they really wanted to, they wanted to do two things. They wanted to build up a nuclear base, a nuclear armament, nuclear weapons. And they wanted the Israelis to help them with that. And they wanted the Israelis to help them with the propaganda around the world. Right. Well, they basically like, how is it you guys are doing a apartheid yet? No one, all the liberals even love you. And everybody's giving you good press. But we do apartheid and we're the bad guys. Right. Yeah. Well, yeah. They're going to have all the lobbies. Yeah. Yeah. We do pushing for them. So, anyway, the Milchon agreed to do that. He came to the United States. They did a play in New York that really bombed. And it was a ticketed by the anti apartheid groups. And the United States saying that this play is just trying to propaganda is apartheid and all that. Which it was, right? Exactly. Well, it's actually backing in with apartheid money. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And they went on to look into making movies after that. And until eventually there was a breakup after they began making some of these movies with some of the propaganda pro apartheid propaganda. And so Milchon then decided he wanted to become a full-time producer in Hollywood. And at the same time, the Israeli intelligence wanted him to be the, the, the, the, the, the, they're agents basically for acquiring nuclear materials in the United States. And so he had this sort of dual job. He set up a front company in California to acquire military goods for the Israelis bypassing the Pentagon. And through this front company called Milco, the key things that the Israelis wanted were critons. Critons are like, well, they basically set off nuclear weapons. They're triggers, I think, is you describe yet a great way of describing it. I got to say you're writing the way you describe things that are scientific or cybernetic or whatever, you know, or computer oriented, which can be very convoluted when people try to describe them. And you do a great job for, you know, non-tech people of making it seem like you had that description of the critons are the triggers that set off the explosives kind of set up like a 32 sided soccer ball. And then it pushes the explosion so fast because it goes at like bazillion miles. It's a lot. Yeah, it pushes so fast inward that it then crushes. Yeah, it crushes the, this is what fusion, I guess, right? Yeah, so, so anyway, yeah, the word I was looking for was blasting cap. So that's like they're like the blasting caps. You put them on the, on the nuclear weapon and it's the trigger. It sets it off. Anyway, the Israelis needed them because they're extremely small and they don't really look like much. They look like little light bulb of their extremely delicate in terms of how they're made and they were on the bomb that went off in. Hiroshima, for example, that's for the company that makes them first used them. So Israel wanted those, they wanted a milchin to get them for them. And that's what his milk co front company was all about. So it's for a guy that was working for for milk. It was his sub agent in American by the name of Richard Smith. Yeah. He was he ran milk. He was basically milchons sub agent. And so he got all these crytons for milchin and sent them over almost a thousand miles. Or almost a thousand of them to Israel, all illegal. And eventually the FBI caught on to it and they arrested Smith. But they didn't do anything to milchin. Right. Because milchin was in Israeli and you know, we just don't, is there do anything to Israelis who were spies. No matter which administration happens to be in office. So ironically Netanyahu was in the embassy at the time. He had just sort of joined the Israeli government at the time and he became the number two person in the embassy. And he worked out a deal to sort of save milchin. While milchin sub agent Smith was facing 105 years in prison. So Smith Smith disappeared. He fled just before trial and hit hit out for about 16 years in Spain. He was always trying to get milchin to help him send him some money or whatever milchin was too cheap he never did. And so. So he eventually got caught sent back and Smith got caught and sent back and basically spilled his guts to the to the FBI and told him everything about what. What was going on including milchin's role and then they basically wanted to go after milchin. But somebody high up said no you can't touch milchin and so he was never even questioned by the by the FBI and I could just sort of see that in the documents I read. I could just sort of see the frustration there. And so he's living happily ever after making billions of sub agent goes to jail. And he's after making movies. I mean it's insane the whole. In Malibu. Yeah, so so he's getting away with it all. But he had this sort of desire in him to show what a hero he was in Israel. And he's making all these movies about like Mr. and Mrs. Smith about spies. And so he said he had this somebody said he has a sort of spy in him. And so he had the spy had to get out. So somebody this TV program and in. And Tel Aviv was going to do a local program in Hebrew broadcast only in Israel. And so he thought he and they wanted to interview on the battle out of stuff. So he agreed to do the do the interview. And one of his old buddies was right next to him. Robert De Niro, who he'd known from very beginning and starting his career. So the host of the program. He began getting into the topics and he started talking about his life was a. You know arms dealer for the South African government and everything like that. He admitted it. I think he didn't didn't think that we were going to go anywhere. He just had to tell somebody right he had to get the glory for it. Yeah, because he did this for Israel, you know. And he certainly didn't do it for the for the black population of South Africa. And so he he started talking all about that. Then the host asked him about the the crytons and all that are host asked him about his dealings with the Israeli intelligence and nuclear weapons and all that stuff. And being a spy in California. And so he said, well, yeah, it was it was fun being a spy or something like that. And then she asked him about the. This incident involving the FBI and all that. Oh no, she asked De Niro about that. And De Niro was sitting next to him and De Niro said, oh yeah, he told me about that years ago about how he was doing with all that. And he had these little things that he sent to Israel. And then it sounds like good files, you know, just things, you know, just little things. Yeah, little things. That's what he actually said. He little things here. And then Milch and pipe that. He said, crytons. And then De Niro said, yeah, crytons. He said, yeah, he told me about that. You know, years ago, you know, he's doing this for his country. I never problem with that. You know, Milch and doesn't say anything. Obviously, so obviously he didn't jump up the table. That's not that I didn't do it. He was a one who said, crytons. Yeah. So. So the jig was up basically after that show, although you know, be really watching outside of Israel. But somebody at the State Department happened to see that story. And all of a sudden they took Milch and 10 year of ease away. And that was really frightening for him because he'd been living here most of his adult life. And all of a sudden now his visa was canceled. So he got very panic. He plus he was thinking the FBI is after him now possibly. So he went to Netanyahu and said, can you intervene? You know, with the Secretary of State. John Kerry, right? Yeah. And then yeah, I said, yeah, okay, I'll do that. I'll do that for you. Be a big favor, but I'll do it for you. So he sets up this meeting and eventually Milch and gets his 10 year visa. You know, here it is. The Secretary of State gets a 10 year visa to a guy who's just admitted to being a major spy in the United States. Nuclear weapons spy. A major crime. I mean, this is such a crime. Of course. And stealing, you know, nuclear materials that their laws pass by Democrats, Solar, is Glenn that any country who is involved in anything but stealing nuclear secrets or materials, all aid and arm shipments by law would have to be cut off immediately. Right? Is it Israel? Yeah, to Israel's. And yet, you know, the arms kept flowing and so did the visas. Well, that's one of the reason they didn't go after Milch and, yeah, because they didn't want to offend the. Right. A pack and the pro Israeli lobby. So, having provid you lose those votes. Right. So anyway, so Milch and gets together with John Kerry, John Kerry agrees to give him, I guess, the 10 year visa back. And, and so then Netanyahu. You know, this was a bit of a quip pro quo in Netanyahu's view. He wanted some payoff for this. So, he wanted, you know, some basically bribes. And Milch and agreed to do that. He agreed to give him all kinds of, you know, cases and cases of champagne for his wife, pink champagne, dumb, perier champagne, a thousand drink a lot of it. Yeah, cases and cases. And, and then all these expensive Cuban cigars that go for like a thousand dollars of box or something. Jewelry too for the wife. Yeah, $40,000, bracelet for his wife. And Milch and it's not a guy that likes giving out money very easily. There's that logo you're having there by Adelson, where he says something like he has a long, let's say like a long purse and short arms. He can never reach it. That's right. Yeah. So, there's numerous, numerous quotes of famous people talking about, about Milch. And so anyway, he didn't like it at all. And, but he, but he did it, you know, and, and, and, you know, he was always worried about the FBI knocking on his door. What he never anticipated was Israeli's knocking on his door. And that's what happened. The FBI wasn't going to go after him, but the Israeli judiciary did. I mean, that's one thing that was good about Israel was that they, they, you know, money and prestige didn't seem to bother him. And they also have a very good press over there that's far better than here in terms of covering what's going on. Right. So they, they came after him, the, the Justin department over there, the police, they were going to arrest them. And they eventually agreed to turn evidence or become a witness in a trial involving Netanyahu. And that's where we are today. Yeah. So I'm just taking you from 1965 to present day where Netanyahu is currently the prime minister. He's currently on trial and the first case, what they call case 1000 is the case involving Milch. Right. So, so very few people in the United States understand that what's going on in Israel, at least part of that, started in Hollywood. And, and, and involves a visa that, you know, that he shouldn't have gotten. Yeah, it's kind of a nuclear weapons. That's why I thought it was such a fascinating story. It's amazing. You know, you can't do that in an article. You need a, you need a good number of chapters in a book. After I read your book, I was shocked that I'd never heard of Milch. And I started looking up in the usual place in Wikipedia. And I don't know who wrote his Wikipedia entry, but it's there. It seems to reflect this case, like under biography, it says proudly that, you know, he is the eighth generation of his family in Israel. And then, at the end of the biography, it says, Milch on does not live in Israel and has not been there since 2016. And he's the first generation in NATO leave. Yeah, yeah. Well, interesting too is that, just looking into him more recently, I don't know if it has to do with anything in my, my book or the FBI or whatever, but suddenly he's not living in the United States anymore. He's living in England now. In England? That's where you go, definitely. Yeah, by your way. So they're trying to get him to come back to Israel to testify, but he's saying he's too ill to go to Israel to testify. And he has to do it from, by video from England, he's afraid of being arrested again. Of course. So, yeah, so it's a fascinating story, but nobody's telling it. You have to kind of read my book in order to understand it. It's amazing that it's not being told. And I mean, this is a guy who, you know, of course, was stealing nuclear triggers and nuclear secrets and so on from the US. But also, basically made a whole bunch of money selling weapons to a part, you know, the most evil regime in the world at the time. And then turned around and plowed that money into Hollywood, became best buds with, with De Niro, and wound up winning an Oscar for 12 years of slave. Yeah, on basically off of white supremacist money. It's just astounding like this story. But yeah, let's get into some of the other stories here. And a lot of them do kind of interconnect. I mean, I do want to talk a little bit about North Korea first, because it's another story. It's in the beginning where you get that intersection between Hollywood, politics, fine. And just a whole lot of like grotesque levels of stupidity and incompetence. You know, just just to let readers in on a part of this. So the head of some people might have remembered, when I read your account of it, I was like, oh, yeah, I remember parts of this. I mean, the interview was this movie by Seth Rogan that was supposed to be kind of a, I don't know, a Frat Boy comedy about guys who wind up in the end blowing up Kim Jong-un's head or, you know, attacking blow up and you see his head blow up. And without even, and they wound up getting encouragement from people in the Obama administration and sort of people with one foot in the, in this sort of intelligence world and one foot in the Rand corporation think tank world. I guess it's kind of weird how a dumb movie like that can become, you know, also be seen as a weapon for regime change. And then of course, Kim Jong-un and his regime, they see it as a direct threat. And it winds up having consequences. Can you just, can you explain, I'm not going to be able to do it the way you did. Yeah, sure. Yeah, I tried to write it sort of as a movie too. I mean, the way I wrote it was, yeah, wasn't it? I didn't write it as a dry story. I wrote it very sort of fun, interesting story with a lot of interesting characters. Yeah, and one reason I was able to do that was because of all the leaks of emails that I was, you know, from internal emails I was able to write as if I'm sitting in the center of the whole story. Anyway, so what happened was that the Sony pictures was having a hard time. They were not making a lot of money. They wanted to get a movie that would make them a lot of money. So they talked to Seth Rogen and they came up with this idea thinking that if they assassinate Kim Jong-un, everybody will come to the movie to watch his head get blown up. Yeah, it'll be the funniest thing in the world and they'll make a hundred million dollars and they'll be able to save their studio again. I mean, that's true. I got to say this is so, I know you're, and you're, you quote, you're quoting all these texts and emails between the heads. Very wealthy, powerful people of Sony was an Amy Pascal and Linton, I can't remember his first name, Linton. It was like a blue blood and, you know, deeply connected. I mean, he hangs out with the Obama's and the Clintons, you know, on a first name basis. And they're like, the exploding head is going to save our career because they're putting out shitty movie after shitty movie. I have to say it's just astounding to me that people at that level are that dumb and incompetent, but anyway, go ahead. Well, that's kind of a theme of the book, isn't it? That, in fact, yeah, but we'll get back to that. Yeah, it seems to me like they, Team America was funny because those guys have talent as obnoxious as they are. They have talent and Kim singing that little song. Yeah, I'm so lonely or whatever. That was pretty funny, but Seth Brogan, I don't know, I guess he contributed the, the sense that well, you know, he's a stoner and they're all stoners. And you know, they think this is funny. But it was a fair amount of greed in this thing. Originally, the whole idea was that they'd make up the name of somebody that wasn't Kim Jong-un. And they'd make up originally it was supposed to be some made up name, right? And even a made up country. But then, Rogan was insisting that they use the real name because that would attract, you know, if he a. Yeah, far more controversial and they wanted controversy, of course, they insisted insisted on having Kim Jong-un's name. Well, that was the thing that set off Kim Jong-un. I mean, he wouldn't have cared if they made a movie about somebody with a different name in a different place. But, you know, using his name. Well, that was Rogan's big mistake. He was counting on that famous sense of humor of the North Korean regime. Right. Yeah. No, it's just satire. Okay. You know, we in North Korea respect that. The first letting you up to see his humor of movies. Yeah. I haven't seen them in four of those movies lately. But so that was the idea. The idea was that they're going to use his real name. That's what really pissed off Kim Jong-un. And so I was able to write this sort of in two ways, looking at it to the eyes of the people with Sony. And then through the eyes of the people in North Korea, including the guy that was actually targeted to go after Sony, the cyber hitman. That's a great story. Yeah. And so it was fun to sort of jump back and forth between them. And so what happened was they decided to go ahead. Sony decided to go ahead with this film. And all those Sony is actually owned by, I mean, Sony Pictures is owned by Sony Corporation, which has run out of Japan. It's, you know, somebody I can't remember the person's name runs it. And he was getting very angry because it looked like there was going to be friction between the company and maybe even Japan. And North Korea because of this movie. So he called up and said, start putting the brakes on this. And so that sent panic into the production people, Seth Rogan and so forth. And Amy Pascal, who was head of the production company, to detonate down. And that's where you get all these really interesting emails where you're saying, well, we've taken a few sparks out of his head. We take it. His head is not melting quite as fast as it was. It's melting a little differently than before. Yeah, yeah. And, you know, we've, it doesn't blow up quite as fast this time or something like, you know, all these emails going back to, well, try to take more embers out of his head. Okay. Yeah. And so, you know, I mean, where the CEO is sitting, he's like, I'm sitting here between Bill Clinton and President Obama. And I'm asking you if you could take out a little bit of the melting of the head. And, you know, a few of the sparks, whatever, like he's actually, he's actually like texting about this while with the president of the former president. This went so absurd about it all. But it's real. I mean, the one thing, the way you describe the chairman of Sony Corp back in Japan is he's like a, he's like this old bureaucrat type or what? I mean, obviously wealthy who doesn't ever get involved in movies and just something he just kind of sits there behind his desk. And then what, you know, when he saw this come across his desk, it's just something deeper kind of woke him, snapped him awake. And he's like, this is going to create a problem for Japan because that's who North Korea is going to take it out on. Well, right. North Korea makes a point of having its tests of possibly nuclear arm missiles fly over Japan. There is a, there is to put it mildly a bit of a history there. So he's going to take it. Plus I mentioned in the book that is, you know, his father and grandfather were. And I think it was his grandfather that was ahead of the head of North Korea when they captured the American ship. The, the, the pool of the crew for a whole year. And then after that, they shot down a American spy plane with about 30 people on board. Almost started nuclear war. So, you know, it's a very dangerous country to play games with. And that's exactly what they were doing. And then you're mentioning, yeah, Amy Pascal, the head of the Sony pictures there said in one of the emails that. This was the first time she'd ever heard from the head of Sony. And all the time she'd been there and she was in Columbia pictures before that. And she'd never heard from him. And this is the very first time. And she understood it was serious. And then you have Seth Rogan on the other end saying, this is unacceptable. This is a free speech issue. Man, this is about art. Man, it's about art. You know, I have to have the exploding. Yeah, my masterpiece. Yeah, you know, he left high school in age 16. I think it was now he was trying to pretend he was on foreign policy expert talking about international relations with between the United States and North Korea. So, so anyway, you know, long story short, as we know, the, the movie gets made. And with encouragement, I mean, keeping in the melted face and the exploding head from people in the Obama administration and some Hawks and Rand. But that, that, that was not shown, right, not internationally. The North Koreans were still, you know, pretty pissed off about that. But actually, they were pissed off about other stuff that they found out about. And I guess this is where you get into slightly more technical or somewhat more technical stuff, which is. Well, just a back up a minute. Yeah, is that the North Koreans, to give them credit, they were trying, especially good diplomatically to stop. Right. They sent the White House letters. They did a number of other things saying, will you please just have them change the name? That's all we're asking. And I'm big deal. Nobody else has ever, you know, been done like this. Somebody sitting in office, they've never, always never done this. Anybody else, and they just laughed them off and the White House. So, which was a big mistake because Kim Jong Un has a very powerful cyber agency. Yeah, that was a really interesting. I didn't realize that. How I start this whole book and how I start that chapter is this meeting. It's a dinner in North Korea. Yeah. And the head of US intelligence, James Clapper is with sitting in a limousine, going to dinner with the head of intelligence for North Korea. And the whole reason is ostensibly to get some prisoner, US prisoners released, a couple of them sent back. And so they're heading out to dinner and they come to this strange place. They have one story bowling ball on top. I mean, a bowling pin on top. And it's the restaurant they're going to. And so they're sitting there and they both have deep secrets that they're not telling each other. Kim Jong Un secret is that at that moment as they're sitting there, he's already his cyber people are already into Sony. And they're stealing everything there is in Sony and Sony and Clapper, the head of US intelligence has no knowledge about it. And then Clapper has his secret that they launched a cyber war against North Korea that failed early on in the administration. And so those are the two things that sort of start off the whole book or the whole chapter anyway, where it eventually Sony gets totally wiped out by Kim Jong Un. He gives him one last chance to change the name. They don't do it. And so he says, OK, go. And they destroy all the computers at Sony. They release all that material publicly. It was the biggest cyber attack against the US corporation in history. And later on, he finds out about the cyber attack that the Clapper and the Obama administration launched on him. And then he launches another attack on the US, which becomes a big international cyber pandemic. So yeah, it all starts out with this movie though. Yeah. This sucks net, right? That's that part of the story. I, again, maybe I just didn't pay proper attention, but I, I've heard of course about how it was deployed against Iran and how it was effective in analyzing and damaging Iran's Iran's nuclear program. I didn't realize that they launched the same thing against North Korea and it failed. And then they got found out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they did it because North Koreans were using the same kind of centrifuge. So, so they figured they, you know, get a tooth for there. They attacked both of them around the same time. And then the Iranian nuclear infrastructure was far less protected than the North Koreans. So it was succeeded in Iran, but because of the better protections in North Korea, it didn't succeed. But I got to say, isn't that pretty damn dangerous? I mean, Iran, Iran doesn't have nukes. And when we launch that against North Korea, they have nukes. I mean, it's, it's, it's essentially a physical attack. I mean, America comes off pretty damn aggressive and kind of reckless here. And yeah. And North Korea, to my surprise, anyway, comes across as quite reasonable. Yeah. It's kind of super doing modulated stages of threat. Yeah, unlike the United States, it's a, you know, invades a country about every five or ten years or whatever. The war kills, I don't know how many millions of killed in Vietnam or Iraq, Afghanistan and so forth. Now, North Korea hasn't really attacked any other country. They haven't really launched any other wars. I mean, it's about time we started talking to them like adults. And, you know, but the White House won't do it because they're afraid that the Republicans will go after them for being weak on North Korea. So we have this lunatic country doing lunatic things all the time. And that one could have easily gotten us, you know, in deep trouble. If all of a sudden we declared war on North Korea, a country with nuclear weapons and a country that surrounded by friends like Japan and so forth. In the 1930s, they said, who wants to die for Danzig? But God, who wants to die for a Seth Rogen stoner? Right, yeah, yeah. No, especially a bad one, you know. I know. Really not funny. It's just, it's incredible. I mean, it is a physical attack. Like this worm can go in and actually do physical destruction. Well, it doesn't, it physically destroys those centrifuges. What it does is it goes in and controls the mechanism, the computer controls of how fast the centrifuges spinning around. And it makes it spin around way too fast or else way too slow. And in both cases, it breaks down the centrifuge. So even in the United States, I mean the definition of an act of war or cyber war is a destruction of a physical object. So, you know, even in our own definition, that would have been an act of an actual act of war. An actual act of war by attacking North Korea that way. So, yeah, it was a very dangerous. And as I write in the book, I mean, I donate a number of pages to how numerous people in high office in Washington over the years, including James Clapper. Head of US intelligence has said, look, North Korea is not going to give up their weapons. They just aren't. They see what happens when a country gives them up. They become Alibia. And so they aren't going to do it. So the only alternative is to work out something. But we're never very good at working out anything. You know, we aren't doing a very good job in Ukraine. And so that's the story of America's life, I guess. One of the patterns in the book, as you've said many times, it's the, this, this frightening incompetence at the top. And it's related. Yeah, it's really like Rogers. And it seems to be related to some to another theme of yours, which is lack of accountability. Like there is no penalty. Like to ask a naive question, why isn't there a penalty? I mean, this nobody particularly loves most of these high level military bureaucrats. Why can't they be fired? Yeah, I know I spent three years in the Navy. It's a very low ranking person. And I once got into trouble for, I mean, I was stationed in Pearl Harbor and Hawaii. And I got into trouble for writing off the base on my motorcycle. Without socks on, they actually had a reason you had to have socks on when you were on base. Take them off when you get off base. But when you cross the threshold with the, with the Marines here, they had to be on. So I got in trouble with that. But you know, the head of NSA doesn't get in trouble for, for losing all the, or most of NSA cyber weapons and, you know, half a billion pages of documents and so forth. So, yeah, that was an argument I made in the book that, look, you want to start someplace, start with firing a few people at the top end of the, a totem pole. Do you think it's worse now, the lack of accountability than when you started as a writer and journalists like, I don't know, the late 70s or the 80s? It's about the same. Nothing happened back in those days either. It just seems to be a continuum of the Pentagon protecting their own and the White House and everyone into, you know, take responsibility for some of the horrible things that happen. There was a rumor that Roger was going to get fired at the end of the Obama administration that they were talking about it, but then the administration ended in the, and Trump came in and no actions were taken. So we left happily ever after and then they all go off and make millions, you know, as heads of some cyber company or whatever. The only big difference I could definitely see is at least for a brief period in the 70s, there were, there were hearings and investigations, you know, whatever it led to, not much. But it doesn't feel like we even have that. I mean, you know, you describe how Martin and the shadow brokers and these two entities or guy, I guess the shadow brokers is probably just one hacker dweeb who worked in a part of the end of the day. That's a lot of part of the NSA, much of it. Yeah, but you know, just between the two of them, they've stolen, you know, most of the secrets and that they have it's just. Yeah, at the same time we were going at the same time we were going after Russia was Russia gate right. He had all this other stuff going on and nobody knew about it was so absurd losing half the or three quarters of the, you have some employees doing three quarters of NSA cyber weapons that ended up in North Korea and Russia causing a cyber pandemic. Yeah, you had Hal Martin walking out with half a billion that's billion with a B pages of documents, you know, not actual pages by the flash drives and so forth, 50 terabytes and. And then Hillary Clinton had two spies in her campaign that nobody knew about one of them was a serial pedophile that nobody discovered it's the real pizza gate. Israel had a spy and Israel had a spy in the Trump campaign trying to throw the election and you know, but we're looking for Russians and. So the end of going after I write in the book there of my last chapter the end of going after some student at American University. Maria Botina student from Siberia and you know that was there that was their big trophy at the end of this whole thing was so big that muller didn't even bother to put it in his report you never even bother to look into it so absurd. It was such a stretch up yeah. Yeah so so that's that was why I thought that the book was needed to be done was because there are so many these absurd things taking place and nobody is writing about. Right can you talk a little bit about the UAE agents who infiltrated Hillary's campaign and then we'll get to Israel again this took place in 2016 around the same time that everybody's focusing on Russia and Russia gate. And so the UAE the crown prince of UAE is an extremely wealthy person I'm probably the wealthiest person on earth and the most powerful person in the Middle East and so he's also very savvy he's used to using working one. Power off another power and so forth so what he wanted to do was to find out what Hillary Clinton was up to who was the candidate for president democratic candidate for president and also to. To influencer in pro UAE policies so he came up with the idea of getting putting some spies in her in her campaign and the key guy that he came up with was a person who had worked for him for years and he came over and the problem was he had a fair amount of. Baggage in terms of if he donated money to the campaign it would set off a lot of bells because it would look like it was coming from the Middle East so he needed a basically a front man and he came up with this guy in Hollywood who was a con man and made millions of dollars conning people out of money so he would be the front man so the front man donated millions of millions of millions of dollars to the Hillary Clinton campaign. This guy out of nowhere and so he would go to the all the top events and appear with the UAE spy and the spy would get information on what Hillary is doing and then I actually got documents of the spy sending the emails back to a spy master saying oh we met with a big lady today and we're having another big meeting with her tomorrow. I can't wait to get back and tell you all about it. What struck me in Mark both I think about that was the idiotic elementary school codes like yeah I'm having a meeting with my big sister age. Who would that be? Right yeah yeah it was just sending regular emails to yeah so yeah so you got the two guys one guy is a spy the other guy is the front man and so they wanted to have a pride. They wanted to have a private little dinner for Hillary and her husband bill the former president in their own little living room and so they approached the campaign about that and they said sure we'd be happy to do that better cost you a million dollars and so they said there's no problem they gave them a million dollars and so they had their private little they actually had two little parties one for Hillary and then a few days later another one. For Bill and then they wanted to do another one for him in Las Vegas and they said that'll be another million dollars and they they they cooked up another million dollars this is America you know this is a deeply principal work. These one-suicereal pedophile and a spy the other is front man and a con man and and you know there's not looking into the who these people are they can give me a million bucks show up and and at one point the guy writes the only time you ever wrote back and said well we couldn't do it this time because they wanted five times more than we were asked. I don't know how much they were you know they were yeah this is the crown prince of UAE I don't know how much yeah yeah it was too expensive for him. Yeah. So yeah it's it's amazing how corrupt they are the Clintons and it's almost for some people I think that was almost the the appeal of Trump is that he was so open about corruption and the Clintons were virtue you know pretending to be virtue. And there was just a sort of feeling of we're sick of the lot lies will go. Yeah absolutely right you know that's why all this talk about norms and decorum and civility is is so completely wrong headed those words make people want to vomit they know it's a lot. So I'm going to read that one chapter of mine and you'll see how it's said I mean how absolutely pathetic that whole campaign was and how she was in this whole this whole thing you know everything is is money. You know I started off the chapter with this fundraising dinner they had at the you know big movie stars home in Hollywood and it was 30 thousand dollars some huge amount for person to go to it. So I remember these things and they were it was so embarrassing that on the on her drive in her secret service car going to the party these protesters and number were working for or supporting Bernie Sanders was standing out on the road and they would throw dollar bills at the cars it went. So I was telling a blue to crap blue to crack you know so yeah I mean that never gets seems to get into the news a lot of stuff I write about it there so that was one of the most surprising things about the book for me like I how how could I not know about Milchon I read a fair number of sort of trashy Hollywood stories what I've never heard of it it's a stonish. He's protected because he says really he's never been a US citizen he's a really citizen and Hollywood won't go after him you know because he's one of them I mean he's a big producer in the US won't go after him because he's Israeli and you can't arrest it's really I mean it's a point I make all through the book they have this immunity. If they did a resume as you pointed out to for his crime then that means the crime you would be arrested for would mandate US cutting off a Israel. It was a man that you know exposing the program that we're all supposed to pretend doesn't exist the nuclear program you know with stolen US what's it's the same reason Jimmy Carter covered up the fact that we knew that Israel blew up a had a nuclear weapons test right. And you know he went to this you know he sort of try to make up for after he left office for his subservience to Israel but while he was in office he did a lot of things that were totally unethical and that was one of them right. So let's get to the Trump campaign because look rush a gate and I don't want to keep it if we kept you for a long time and I if I had my way we'd keep you for another two hours but that's not going to happen. But look rush a gate I don't know you tell me what you think from your vantage point but I think rush a gate was one of the most sort of political cultural culture warping campaigns or you know hysteria as I've seen in my life I mean it made people crazy and I think we're still seeing the effects of it playing out how much it just warped so much in media and in the end. And in sort of political culture but bring that to your book you know you get into the story of what the real rush rush a gate was the idea that the Trump campaign colluded secretly you know whether through like these secret servers that were supposedly set up between Pennsylvania and Moscow or whatever somehow secretly colluded with the Kremlin to install Putin's puppet in the White House. Over whom he had compromised from a p tape so we can control them and do whatever he want I mean it was the most absurd goddamn story but the reality it turns out was that the Israelis planted but that Netanyahu basically colluded with the Trump campaign to put Trump in office to get what Israel or what Netanyahu in particular wanted. And part of that was piggybacking off what they knew about actual Russian actual Russian operation which was stealing the DNC emails and leaking them which they did for different reasons we can get into but anyway yeah could you tell that the story of the of what Israel actually did with the Trump campaign before the investigation the Russians had hacked the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC and they. Secretly hacked it in other words the FBI had no knowledge of it that they were doing the hacking and stealing all these emails from Hillary Clinton and the DNC so that happened and then there was a investigation set up the Mueller Mueller team to investigate whether there was collusion I mean we already knew at that point that the Russians had stolen the Hillary Clinton emails and so forth. So what the investigation was for was to look into whether there was actual collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and it went on for about two years well early on very early on in May of 2016 before anybody in the United States including the FBI knew anything about Russia hacking the DNC and Hillary Clinton. Roger Stone who was a very close associate of Donald Trump on his campaign was a person from Benjamin Netanyahu a secret agent from Netanyahu got in touch with Roger Stone and this agent wanted to get in touch with Trump and they thought by doing it through Roger Stone would sort of be a back door to get to Trump. So this secret agent got in touch with Roger Stone and just to give you one piece of background here all this isn't coming from some guy I'm talking to in the back of a parking garage this is a these are documents from the FBI that were released under the Freedom Information Act and what I'm is a search warrant for this secret agent's communications and the others in affidavit. Sworn affidavit saying they have all this evidence against this secret agent including copies of emails and so forth. So what I'm describing here is based on official FBI documents so what happened was the Israeli agent whose name was redacted from the FBI documents got in touch with Roger Stone and that very same day again this is early may before anybody ever heard of the Russians hacking into Hillary Clinton that very same day Roger Stone started email I started to started googling some of these interesting names like goose for 2.0 and a variety of other names that nobody ever heard of at that time. DC leaks yeah and so what the FBI began looking into was how did he know this stuff so early on and and that was the key for them to start looking into this secret Israeli agent so what the Israeli agent was offering basically was this same information that the Russians were getting from Hillary Clinton the emails and the the emails and everything and the way the Israelis were able to get it was by tapping into the Russian communication system which was one of their key targets the NSA had the Israelis have a very sophisticated e-dropping system like ours as we have NSA they have a thing called unit 8200 which a lot of it is based on our NSA. So they were able to tap into the Russian communication system extract all this data that they were getting from Hillary Clinton and and then they were offering it basically to the to the Trump campaign which would obviously help give him give him heads up on all this information before anybody else would know about it and what they wanted in return was a quick pro quo basically will give you all this secret data and what we want to return is our key favor is for Trump to agree to recognize Jerusalem as being the sole capital of Israel in other words all of Jerusalem is going to be all of Israeli and we're not going to have to negotiate who gets what part of Jerusalem with the Palestinians. That's been the policy of the United States from the very beginning that Jerusalem would be subject to negotiation it wasn't going to be all Palestinian it wasn't going to be all Israeli it was going to be subject to negotiation what Netanyahu wanted was to do away with that and to just have Jerusalem have the president of the United States to declare that Jerusalem would be solely Israeli. And at the end of the summer you went law international law to write a new and resolutions on this so quite and by late every foreign policy agreement to the US has had since the beginning so so at the end of the summer after all these meetings constant meetings with between the Trump campaign and the secret Israeli agent Trump agreed to that and in September of 2016 he had the secret meeting or this private meeting with Netanyahu and his penthouse in New York and at the end of the meeting they both came out and and and Trump said yes I'll agree I'll agree to to do the what Israel wanted I'll agree to recognize Jerusalem as being the sole part of Israel and he had already agreed to do away with the Israel. So this was the other big item on Netanyahu's agenda and he got it at the end and also these documents there is mentions of the PM the PM and the FBI and actually notes the PM stands for Prime Minister that's just amazing I mean so there you have a plain sight these allies you know and then of course you also get into this massive foreign influence and meddling operation run by the Israelis with some pro-Israel American oligarchs from both parties is Sheldon Addison Hyamsuban and you know you compare that to how rinky dink this the the precautions you know internet troll operation was compared to what the Israelis have going on it's it's astounding. This revelation your book was was a big shock to me and I just had to wonder the journalists who were constantly blaming rush for basically for their darling Hillary's failure did they know that this was actually much more an Israeli operation than a Russian one. You know they have the same access the same information I had you know even after the book came out they aren't reporting that Israel had this connection. It's a if the mainstream media that's that's why I write about these things because the mainstream media media doesn't they didn't write about the liberty. I had a right-hate chapter on it this is 34 Americans killed a ship destroyed and Israeli did it and there was you know just turning heads the other way it's the same thing with all these things I write about and that's why I thought somebody had a right about this stuff and so I did. Because you can't depend on the New York Times or the Washington Post. Yeah I mean as far as I know the New York Times and the post have still not reported that both I could be wrong either I think definitely New York Times that both human rights watch which is not particularly radical as human rights agencies go and amnesty have you know described Israel as an apartheid country just is not been mentioned as far as I know it. No not really Washington Post either and or on NBC and the CPS or CNN or anybody else and it's not just human rights watch and amnesty international it's also Israel's own in general talk and it's the United Nations they came out with the didn't investigation came out with the same thing so you know there's no question it's racist apartheid state. And just as South Africa was and if you want to hide and pretend it isn't or not want to offend whoever it is that you're you know maybe your audience well then you know don't call yourself a journalist. Criticizing Israel like when you wrote about the USS Liberty I don't know how that was received at the time I was working in in Russia we were running a newspaper out there so I I read it without any of the kind of cultural baggage is just like wow you know mind blown but I do recall very clearly how any criticism of Israel was a career and I think there's more space now opened up in the last 10 years that people have just it's. People's eyes have been open more even if at the very kind of top level of the mainstream establishment it's still verbodan but has like has has it affected your book sales your career that you expose a lot of Israeli shenanigans here and and meddling and just a lot of poisonous you know activities in America it hasn't affected me i've been lucky i've been very very lucky. But it's affected a lot of people I know a lot of friends of mine that that that have again this isn't my sole topic yes I don't run away from it when I see it right I don't go after it in other words I'm not going to go out and do a book on Israel that's right but if I'm doing a book on NSA and I find out Israel blew up a ship I'm not going to avoid it right if I do a book on counterintelligence I had no knowledge about all this stuff when I started this book. And I find out about it i'm not going to run away from it I treat Israel just like I treat any other country right and or you know I would treat Israel just as I would treat South apartheid South Africa I don't give it a break just because it happens to be Israel. Because somebody reading my book might get offended if they don't buy my book well you know i'll happily ever after. So it doesn't affect me at all i've never i've been actually lucky i haven't had people come after me or anything i've always written for the New York Times and Washington Post and you know every other magazine you can think of new republic i was calmness for foreign policy magazine for number of years and so and you know the investigator producer for ABC news so i've been part of the mainstream media for most of the world. Right. But I still at the same time i'm not going to run away from i mean the good thing you know when I was with ABC Peter Jennings was very good at that he he never shied away i'd come up with a story of something really bad in Israel and you'd say yeah that's great go on do it. Wow. Get for him. One of them was going after a guy that was an American you fled from the United States after he committed a bombing murder in California. Yeah. And he was hiding out in Israel and I told Peter yeah i can find him i'm good finding people so i went there and i did find him and in the process of his bodyguard fired an oozy machine gun over our heads. She's filming his house but he had gotten away with it because the US government didn't want to go after him right and so I did my story and we showed the guy shooting an is a oozy machine gun at us. Wow. Everything good. And so it made a you know made a big impression and right after that the US finally sent an extra edition request and the Israelis finally arrested him and he's that was back in the early 90s right. Right. 19 early 90s and ever since then he's been in a well he was tried he finally went to trial he's found guilty and ever since then he's been doing life in a prison and. In I think it's in California someplace but he's been serving life ever since he'd be living happily there ever after in Israel if I didn't go after him so you know so I was with ABC Peter Jennings was very good at all that stuff but ever after that. I mean well blitz are used to be the the editor of a packs of propaganda news letter. I know it's nuts. Yeah you're going to get an even ended view of Israel. Yeah really. So anyway so but that doesn't bother me I just write what I write and if they like it they do they don't that's fine. But you know I just thinking about making a bit of sense of this I mean you have everybody up in arms like who the hell helped Trump Trump is I mean everybody let's say you know every Democrat every liberal but everybody really in the establishment as well so very powerful people like how did this happen. And it's sort of it turns out it's right in front of their eyes it who was behind it Israel and why and and Israel has been guilty of other things and granted all friendly country spy on each other as well as adversaries but it's you know it's pretty serious stuff. But this is in spying this is interfering in a democratic election exactly which is supposed to be a country that the people give four billion dollars a year. And meddling is supposed to be Pearl Harbor the way they were talking about this is a new Pearl Harbor meddling so turns out our own ally. When it was real Harbor yeah when it was Russian and so but I but you know I there. There is a reason I can understand a really sort of you know malevolent reason which is sort of nobody's going to have their careers made in government by blaming Israel I mean it causes a problem up and down the line armed sales. Campaign donations etc etc so if you can pin everything on this adversary it's great for budgets it's great for careers it's great for you know your career like it. It mobilizes people it freaks them out I mean I think people would be more confused if it turned out that Israel was the one that helped elect Trump whereas you mean pinning it all on Russia. Yeah like it serves everybody's interest because it's good for Pentagon and spy agency budgets and it's good for you know it's it's good for donations it's good for mobilizing people to your. Of course yeah yeah it's lie it's a bullshit you know but it's sort it sort of saved the intelligence agencies because before Russia gate for the previous I mean for the previous sort of 10 years. The intelligence agencies in the national security state was kind of taking you know hits after hits in in in in the culture because of the lies you know the Iraq war was based on lies and then you had the revelations from a song and then you know you had Edward Snowden exposing all the domestic spying and all that all that stuff. And Russia gate just sort of it just made everybody forget about all of that and run to our spy agencies to protect us from Russia which had put in a president who was controlled by Putin through a p tape. You know I mean it's totally insane but it did save the national security states reputation and it's been flying high since then it seems like yeah you know. And that was what I was trying to overcome and right it's hard to do it in an article but in a book I was able to write how the beginning middle and end of Russia gate house started out with all this allegations you know in the New York Times and Washington Post and all the mainstream media about. Dastardly the Russians are in colluding with Trump and infiltrating the campaign and all that well you know it turns out it's Israelis and and haven't forbid we actually say that in print. And and yet now we're you know in this proxy war with Russia over Ukraine which is going from bad to worse this keeps getting worse it just did a piece on how we almost came to World War III by the accidental shoot down of a of a US spy plane with 30 over 30 Brits on it. I've seen the media sometimes started writing which is a very long time ago and I've never seen it sort of. Bear off course so so far as I see it now yeah yeah it's real it has not it didn't write itself you know even after because it feels like. Recigate in the reporting which was just pure hysteria driven it it it permanently change it's you know it's not like okay Trump. Lost the election and then they sort of went back to becoming more responsible and more adversarial and doing their job more as before it's just permanently war. Yeah and a lot of these are the same people who who made the same allegations about the Saddam Hussein weapons and mass destruction you know you know they never learned I mean you know. A few of them apologize after that and now they just went headfirst and to rush a gate all I know you know we're in start wondering how. How's this happening anyway that's one of the reasons why I do what I do I left a did 10 years as the producer at ABC I left because it started going downhill and and the media. Has been going downhill ever since with the you know the Iraq war and and now rush a gate all that which is why I like writing books because that way I could. Diverse myself from mainstream media and write to long form what would I think should be written it's how about reviews last question because I know we've kept you a long time do you expect. This book to be reviewed or has it been reviewed by say New York Times Washington Post those. I mean I think that's probably one of the reasons you know I criticize both papers quite a bit in in my book and obviously Israel so now all my other books have been reviewed and you can see the back jacket of my hardcover that came out it list a lot of the you know great reviews of had New York Times Washington Post and all the other. Magazines and so forth so yeah so I mean that that's the penalty of a although you know I've had a lot of media attention the nation magazine that a cover story on my. Yes Israeli part of the bad excerpts in long excerpt on the Hillary Clinton aspect in in the daily beast business business insider I guess it's just called it cider now did too long excerpts on excerpts on the China spine and so there's been a number of and there's other place that have done long excerpts and I'm. So I'm not going to be a long excerpt and all kinds of things like that so I've gotten a lot of you know quite a bit of publicity from basically mainstream media except not the New York Times or the Washington Post but you know I give them a hefty spanking in my book. Since you said this to me you know by email I had already read it though my last question just quickly about your your latest story you did a fresh piece this isn't in your book about the Nord Stream bombings and you propose your. Theory your take on it which which is different than her shoes which is that Ukrainian intelligence special operations people with peers with Polish helping British training but and and probably American for knowledge but but primarily anyway you know Ukrainian military intelligence career buddhan of operation was responsible for it I don't know do you want to give a can you give a brief break down. So I'm kind of how that how you came to that conclusion having looked at it fairly closely the. There's been a number of there were number of leaks that came out involving Ukraine and the I think it was a couple days after the incident there was an intercept involving Russia saying that Ukraine was looking to attack Western infrastructure and then there were a number of leaks that came out of the investigations and in Europe pointing the finger at at Ukraine and possibly Poland and so you know so that was there I mean there is some hard evidence that maybe Ukraine was involved and so what I wanted to do is to just take a very deep look at the possibility you know what what are the what would be the the motive means an opportunity that Ukraine would have to do this nobody's written about that before all they said is that oh there's a sleek and they think maybe Ukraine did it but nobody's really written about how that could possibly be if that was a possibility so that's what I did I look at it and it was very clear to me that that was a very good possibility because they certainly the motive they came out numerous times saying that the pipeline was basically an act of war and that it would to pry them both of money because the Russians were using the pipeline going through different pipeline going through the Ukraine and they were making a lot of money on that and that if the Russians all the sudden got Europe to take the Nord Stream pipeline it would put Europe in the sort of in debt to the Russians which they didn't want so there was a lot of motive and plus I looked at I found intelligence reports internal Ukrainian intelligence reports where they were talking about how this is dangerous and we've got to stop this we've got to stop this pipeline so they certainly had a motive in terms of the means of I began looking into what kind of weapons and armaments that Ukraine had and ironically they they're extremely strong and they're extremely well fitted in terms of undersea warfare they have all kinds of undersea drones that are very powerful they have this brand new one that is capable of going 2000 kilometers under the sea it can hold 9,000 pounds of explosives and then there's a sort of a junior version of that that can hold 1,100 pounds of explosives and the NATO has said that the pipelines were blown up with 1,100 pounds of explosives the problem with like Hersh's article and so forth which seemed extremely complex I don't know why would you get no way involved and using fragment why are I using divers why are you using divers you could do the same thing with a drone much easier so I just didn't ring solid all that stuff but it was plus it was virtually no sourcing for it and so anyway so I started looking more at the Ukraine and then found out that the Ukrainian Ukrainians Navy was being trained ironically just a month or so before the explosion by the US and the in the UK Navy into how to use underwater explosives using these drones one other thing about an undersea drone that's used in demining is one way to get rid of mines you send a drone near the mine and you place an explosives on it or you place an explosive drone next to it and then you just blow it up so the drone can attach an explosive like with an arm or something oh sure yeah and I showed how both Ukraine and Poland had those things and Poland came out in a joint article in political the Prime Minister of Poland and the Prime Minister of Ukraine earlier on saying that the pipeline has to go I mean this pipeline is terrible shouldn't be there and all that really critical about the pipeline and ironically at the same time Poland was developing their own pipeline that was taking natural gas from the North Sea bringing it through Norway and the very day after the Nord Stream pipeline was blown up there was a huge ceremony in Poland where they the Prime Minister and the President opened the new pipeline so here's one day the Nord Stream pipeline gets blown up the next day is the opening ceremony for Baltic pipe which was the Norway one right because I think that was a Hersh's article too because he said Norway was in his article his account it was Norway was part of it and that was part of his story but it went through Norway and then went to Poland but you know he had these Norwegian ships going and you know if you want to pull pipelines not really that hard if you have underwater equipment he never in his article mentioned once about drones or undersea drones or weaponized drones we've got lots of them and you know we we are very good at undersea warfare and you don't have to get some divers from Pensacola for that to go down with some Norwegian divers to place an explosive down there I mean I like to I have known him for 40 years we were good friends Yeah we had him on the show for this article and people went ballistic over it and you know and he did say I asked him about sourcing and stuff and he said do you think I really just had I quoted one anonymous source but do you really think I just had one source for this you know but I'm not going to get into that because that's what I do I protect my sources but well I do too I have lots of sources too but I'm also don't go with one source for a major article like that and I also indicate how the source knows what he knows right I mean this source apparently knows everything from meetings in the you know White House to what went on on the bottom of the bottom of the Baltic Sea or whatever so so you don't buy versions version then basically I mentioned his article and I just say look I mean you know I've been in this business a long time I agree with sometimes with people and sometimes people disagree with me it's just the way it works you know this baseball team right yeah so yeah and on the opening there he talks about this meeting it's a place in this the building next door of the old executive office building well that name was changed long time ago and said it took place in the offices of the president's foreign intelligence advisory board right it's now the president's intelligence advisory board and it doesn't meet there it actually meets about a block away in another place so so that there were number of problems with it so that's why I really wanted to look into not only that when you do a story like that you're really blaming people I mean he was blaming the director of the CIA Bill Burns and you know if you look at his background this isn't the kind of thing he would do he was a guy that was trying to keep the US away from going into Ukraine all his career his entire career was like that from the time he was at a you know a diplomat in the embassy in Moscow in the 90s to when he was ambassador and so forth so his cables are great I got to say his can you know when the release those cables they were really pretty amazing yeah I quote from numerous times in the book showing how you know all these other people are pushing for it in the 1990s we really blew it because we could have done something really nice yeah by creating some kind of a mutual agreement with the president's intelligence mutual agreements with the budding democracy called Russia instead we all we wanted to do is screw him I didn't even write in the book that was going to put in there how we we threw their election yes that's another story exactly yeah I was going to say I mean well yeah we we threw the 1996 election we backed Yeltsin's bombing of yeah exactly parliament in 93 but it wasn't just that yes we bragged about it yes when those guys came back they told time magazine time magazine yeah cover story with a caricature of Yeltsin holding both a Russian flag and an American flag yes and and and the caption on the on the cover was how we won the Russian war or something like that how we won one the Russian election rather yeah the United States with you know a president of the United States holding a Russian flag and I know I know yeah but that's okay because we did it but you know him forbid Russia I know I mean the bottom line is when Russia tapped into Hillary Clinton's campaign what they did was they found the the corruption that was going on inside the Hillary tag campaign you know the head of the DNC had a resign was in a couple days so yeah they did what the US press shouldn't have done that that they should have done it and I'm not you know I'm not saying that the Russians were right for doing it I'm just saying that yeah that that is what came out of it it was specific revenge I think also for because in 2011 late 2011 it was US funded through the National Dumber for Democracy and USA and so on NGO's anti basically election fraud NGO's and technologies funded by the US that was used that that were cited by people to show a fraud in the parliamentary elections 2011 when Putin was going to come back as president I mean this then his election was a few months later and that sparked so the way the US technology worked or funded technology worked is that it spread around in real time to online younger Russians how the election was being stolen it probably wasn't any more fraudulent than any other election but you could watch it happening and it sparked the largest protests I mean I think in post Soviet Russian history and the Russians said you're meddling in our elections and Hillary said deal with it it's freedom yeah it's the more it's not corruption we're exposing corruption and so this was this was you know pretty clearly the response to that was okay we're going to expose corruption too and you'll see right 10 volumes on American hypocrisy yeah and you have written a lot on it as it is but anyways thank you so much this is just been a great time I could go on forever and it was I think and I think our subscribers will be really excited to hear this and I can't recommend enough James Bampard's new books by fail to everybody it's really entertaining it is funny and it is it will outrage you and shock you at times and anyway great books so
