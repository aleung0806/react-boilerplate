    "text": " Hello and welcome to another episode of Radio Warner. The day today is March 22nd, 2023. This is episode 370. You are listening to Radio Warner. Subscribe at patreon.com-radio-warnard. I'm Mark Ames in Rochester, up on Lake Ontario. I'm online with the Warner John Dolan, aka Gary Brecher in Glasgow. If I sound a little slow today, it's because I'm not functioning very well. I have had complications since they pulled out a muller about 10 days ago. It won't stop hurting and I can't sleep and other complications. That's my excuse in advance for if the synapses aren't firing too well. Yeah, tooth pain is no joke. The link between tooth pain and cognition is very well documented. I read a lot about that regarding American children because I can't remember the statistics, but it's something like at least one in six children can't see a dentist, can't afford it in America. Some huge number and they have tooth problems, cavities and so on. Then they can't learn. There was a time early on in the financial crisis, early on in the Obama era, when there was some state, I want to say maybe it was Alabama even, or some states or some, they were trying, thinking of introducing a program to provide free dental care for people, like really poor people under a certain income level. Because children were just screwed for life not even from just being poor and having teeth and pain, but they wouldn't be able to learn. The dental association stepped in, lobbied hard and had it killed because they figure out of those children, one in six parents are going to scrounge up the money to pay them and the other five out of six children can go screw themselves. That's life. But the dentist need their boats or something. They got to kill them. That doesn't even sound smart financially. Haven't they made a killing out of Medicare? I mean, I don't know. Not the way they put it. At a Medicaid, it's very hard to get dental care through Medicaid. Oh, I know, but I mean, I was making a analogy rather than, I mean, they made money out of that, I thought. Maybe, maybe not. I don't know. They could make more other ways. I think they did the math. And it was pretty, and they also, there's also the, you know, these are right wing people. There's also the, you know, today you offer really poor kids a bit of free dental care tomorrow, world and gulags and we have stolen in power. It's the slippery slope argument. I mean, I think it was the, I think it was that same group or some version of it that in the 50s spread around the whole floridated water causes communism because it was hurting their business. I think, I think, yeah, that thing is still going strong. Yeah. It's too bad. I mean, part of the reason that I end up in situations like this is that we were in the water district that didn't fluoridate its water. We were about, you know, half a mile from the border of the water district that did fluoridate its water. And the people I know who live there grew up there. Their teeth are fine. Yeah, it works. I mean, it's just, it's so simple. It works. And did they ever bring the floridated water into your district? I mean, that's an insane story. I guess it started late, but they, they might have, or maybe not because all those places like Pleasant Hill went right wing, very, very right wing. And there's a bill that I just saw introduced in Oklahoma now to prohibit any district from adding fluoride to its water. So they're riding high again. Is that they think it turns children into trans or something? Or what's the thing that scares them now? I don't know. Frogs maybe. I don't know. Yeah, it might be trans now. I don't know. Because it was coming. Rose accrucians tomorrow. All right. So we're going to have a great interview coming up with what we're going to talk about the 20th anniversary of the Iraq war. Because why not? We're a war podcast. And we got to put in our two cents. The war nerd came out of our frustration. I mean, our yours and mine. Because I remember walking around on those streets of Moscow, culminating against all these acela cord or pundits who were suddenly pivoting to become military experts. And I remember my tooth gnashing rage at that. And how dare these people. They didn't. Yes. They didn't go through what I went through, spending their adolescence in the reference room of the library going through james. Oh, dare I'll show them. Yeah. Yeah. All these absolute dorks, Canadian dorks from Ivy leagues, you know, talking like George Patton in, you know, in the movie Patton or something. They were just, they're also top all of a sudden. Yeah. Yep. That was, yeah, that's where the war nerd came from. It was great. That the war nerd hit it off big quickly and big in the exile. And it had to do with, it was in that interim between Afghanistan and so it was 2002. I think we launched some time in 2002 between Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq. I remember the moment when, you know, when it did hit big, uh, because suddenly I not only had permission, but I had all every good reason to write in backyard California colloquial, which I had never been able to write in before. And I've got really popular. And I remember the moment when I thought, if I went pro-Iraq war, this could probably make a lot of money. And I could not do it, not because I'm a moral person, because no, I'm not ever a moral person, but because- That's not funny. Yeah, it's just not funny. How dare they, these, yeah, fucking amateurs. I mean, I was not going to give them the satisfaction. So went the other way. And a lot of people were pissed off. They expected the war nerd to lend his voice to the jingoistic fever that came over the US at the time. But since we were both in Moscow at that time, I moved from New Zealand to Moscow around 2002. The experience was very different there. It was like watching someone with a bad fever who was separated from you by a pain of glass. You could watch the thrashing, but luckily it wasn't contagious. Yeah. Yeah, that's a very good way to put it. Yeah, it looked crazy. It just, it looked crazy. And it was sort of alternated between, this is pretty funny. Look how crazy they are. This sort of validates my, you know, the general notion of nihilistic comedy or something. But, and the other hand, like, they can't be serious though. They can't be- Yeah, for a whole thing. It was so cheesy. Yeah. The return of cheese, that really got to me. Oh, yeah. But also, at a more serious level, no one seemed to think about guerrilla war as a possible contingency to be dealt with. It was like, how fast can we get to Baghdad? How long do you think it will take? And it was that mission accomplished Tableau on the aircraft carrier that's so often mocked today. Wasn't as far from mainstream thinking as you might like to think. Again, I think you have to go back well to Afghanistan, which fell quickly and seemed to be yesterday's news if you wanted it to be because the Taliban and Al-Qaeda had skid-addled pretty thoroughly at first. And Kosovo, Kosovo, which looms large over the Iraq war. It really does. People tend to minimize that length. Yeah. Very important. So first, we're going to talk with Seth Harp about an episode and in kind of a larger context, a hidden and really ugly episode that he just wrote about for Rolling Stone in the Iraq war. And we'll let him tell the story. It's a pretty amazing story and it's not an unusual one. It just was not the sort of story that was reported much. So let's get to our interview with Seth Harp. Okay, we are really excited and happy to welcome back to the show. Previous radio-warnored guest Seth Harp is contributing editor at Rolling Stone and also has written for Harp's magazine. In fact, the last time we talked to Seth for episode 328. He had just returned from Ukraine from reporting on the war there for in Legion for Harp's magazine. And we only talked briefly with Seth then about his own experience in the Iraq war. And so today, we asked him to come on and he so generously agreed to come on to talk about both his own experience. And also this incredible story that I had missed when it first published it in 2016. In Rolling Stone, it's called Abandon in Iraq inside two soldiers harrowing escape. The two story of US soldiers left for dead in Iraq. Their epic battle for survival. And the military cover up, they kept them silent until now. So that's the headline and the subheader of the story that you wrote. But okay, so this was first published what, 13 years after the invasion. But as somebody was a veteran there and then he was a reporter who's reported on stories from there. I mean, how unusual was it to find a story like this? And then we should walk us through it. Versus how often did you ever, like, how was it received, I guess. So how hard was it to find stories like this? How often did they actually happen? And, you know, how was it even received at the time? Yeah, I mean, really the last thing, the lesson that I took from it is how spotty the historical record of war tends to be. And how many events just don't make it into the historical record at all. Because, you know, this happened, this event happened in 2004. And the only reason I knew about it was because it involved my unit. And guys, I knew I was there. I wasn't there in Al-Amara, but I was back at the unit headquarters. And so when I went to journalism school, gosh, more than 10 years later, let's see, or about 10 years later, approximately 10 years later, 11 years later. And was, you know, I had to write a story of master's project. It was kind of thinking like, hey, I know this crazy thing that happened back in the day, which was kind of vague. So much stuff had been going on at the time. And, you know, my platoon had its own issues. But I thought, what would happen if I went and tracked this guy's down and figured out exactly what happened. So I went and interviewed them all and got the documents from them and piece it together. And come to realize it was probably one of the biggest battles in Iraq about 2004. And just a total disaster. And, you know, coming right before Bush's election, the reelection in 2004, I mean, the military was at pains to suppress any kind of bad news at that time. As it had done, in the case of Jessica Lynch and Pat Tillman and so forth, but it definitely would have been something on that level had it come out. But, you know, it didn't, didn't it only by a by chance. We really was able to reconstruct it later. So can you summarize the story for us? Well, you know, there's the saying, this stereotype, it's actually an official slogan of the US Army that we never leave soldiers behind. Like, you never move your body behind a combat. Well, actually, yeah, that happens all the time. Surprise, you know, of course, because you have a situation like this ambush in my units, a convoy that we had sent down to Kuwait from Balaad had been ambushed by a much larger element of a Shia militia called the Madi Army, which was led by a cleric named Tadal Saadur. Yeah, that was Tadal's fourth, right? You know, and it, you know, it was one mistake after another. We talk a lot about the, you know, the perfidia, the media and government fabricating the weapons and mass destruction, conspiracy theory, and the Saddam al-Qaeda conspiracy theory. But, you know, probably less attention is paid to how mismanaged the war was in the early years. Like, it was really bad. I mean, they probably could have gotten away with the, with, well, they did get away with it. What am I saying? But one thing that, they really discredited the Bush administration and made it much more difficult for Bush to win re-election and led, I think, lasting damage to the Republican Party's reputation, what's that? How poorly run the Iraq War was in the first couple of years. And, you know, this is an example of that. My unit being a reserve unit being sent on a convoy, like with no air support, with no quick reaction forces, you know, just a bunch of guys who had just basic combat training into this zone where it was actually controlled by the British. There's no communication between the Americans and the British stuff. The British would have told us absolutely do not come out here, you know, we can barely leave. For every time we leave the base, we get, we take fire, you know, we're losing men. They would have worn us away from Al-Amara, but because there was no communication, we just, my units, sent a convoy just blindly rolling into, into that town and that the muddy army just absolutely feasted on that convoy. Overwhelming, small arms fire. You were, you were in that same, okay, your unit that you joined, but had you joined at that time in 2004? Yeah, I was there in Iraq. Yeah, okay. It was my unit. We were based in, when I say my unit, I mean, it was my battalion. Right. We were based in the, at Camp Anaconda, later known as Joint Base Ballad in Ballad. You know, the way these things work is that, so our job needs to be done, they'll gather people together to create like a little task force, a little element. This one was about 70 guys, including guys from my company and my platoon. They were just grabbed, mostly depending upon what trucks you're charged with, what, like I was identified, I had a certain truck that I drove and hadn't that truck been needed for that convoy, I would have been on that convoy, but my truck was not needed. So they pulled together a group of about 70 guys from my unit and sent it down to Kuwait. And I remember watching them leave out the gate because later, because it would happen later. But so they get down there. This is on May 1st, 2004, and they took an overwhelming weight of small arms fire and mortars and RPGs. Two of the guys in my battalion were killed right away, Osirim and Dina and Ramon O'Hate over their names. One guy from Chicago and the other one was from San Diego. And then there was a group, a different pair of sergeants, one in Stewart-Redis and the other one was named Fernando Torres. Those guys were actually in my platoon, like I was close to them, I knew them. I was in contact with them on a daily basis. See, we didn't have any vehicle armor at that time because of the famous Rumsfeld moment where he talks about how you were with the army that you had, about the one you wish you had. Yeah, yeah. I got to say, I mean, so many things you're saying here right now, going in, no communication, no real armor, no air cover, it's basically like Russia going into Ukraine, except that the Modi army didn't have the NATO training and the NATO weapons and so on, but they could still do a lot of damn. I mean, because when Russians did that, everyone was acting like, my god, we've never seen anything like this in a century of such poor planning. We're going to talk this up to Russian barbarism. Russians don't care about lives, they're animals. But I was remembering, like, that was a huge deal in 2004, 2005, how people from, you know, mothers and fathers were having a male armor to their children to like, weld it onto their humbys or right? I mean, that seems to have been lost, I guess. Well, we made our own armor. We found this pile of scrap metal out in this base in Kuwait. I can't remember the name of that base anymore, but we found a bunch of metal there, and because we were army engineers, we all had that, we had the tools and some of us had the knowledge to help others to weld pieces of armor onto the trucks, onto their doors, onto above the windshields, places that were vulnerable to taking small arms fired. One of those, you know, I can't say that it saved my life. I don't know what would have happened, it absent it, but there was a time when I was driving over the bridge in Samara, in October 2004, that someone's bullet, I don't know if it was a sniper, it could have been accidental because there was a lot of shooting going on at the time, but a bullet hit the door, and my leg was against the door, and I could feel the reverberation in my leg. And then afterwards, I looked out to the outside of it, and there was like a groove, like a, on the rusted surface, there was like a polished silver groove where that bullet had hit right on top of my femur, or, you know, I could say that femoral are artery areas, so I don't know, I put, it made me think that, hey, that might have just, that might have saved my life having that there, but I'll tell you what, the two guys I mentioned earlier, Rita St. Torres, the homemade armor they had on their trucks absolutely saved their lives, because their truck was disabled in the middle of the kill zone during the ambush, and they were hunkered down, but behind those pieces, those pieces of metal, they had bolted to their doors, and that was the only thing between them, and, you know, all of the bullets that were coming down and them hot and heavy, and if folks who are interested in it can read the story, of course, I'll try not to go into every single detail. It's a great story, though, so you can give us some details anyway, yeah, it's, it is an amazing story. Well, they, they were left behind in the middle of the kill zone, because the rest of the convoy was just trying to get the hell out of there, and once they regrouped on the outskirts of the city, the commander who's in charge, you know, who was just a second lieutenant, if I'm not mistaken, he may have been a person to him by that one of the years. 24-year-old, yeah. 24-year-old, it was literally the first time he had ever been outside the wire. Wow. I tried to go easy on him in the story, because I really do understand, you know, the dilemma he was faced with, because, you know, he had two guys that also five guys have been shot. So, and some of them have been shot, one of them have been shot in the neck, I remember that, others had been shot in the arms leg, torso, and they're bleeding. You guys are screaming and paying, and they had to, you know, he just made the decision, like, read the story, it's all well certainly dead, there's no chance, if we go back in and try to get their bodies, it's just going to lead to more people getting killed, and he made the decision right then to just ride on, because there were no comms, like, there's no communication at all, they had no, it's just mind-boggling how poorly equipped units like mine were, in the sense that, in a moment like that, we couldn't even reach like a larger element, like an infantry element. Sorry, but what's the idea in the army that, you know, the threat wasn't understood yet, or had the Machti army already made its move, I remember they made their big move, I think in April, it was April 2004, did people know that this was not a safe zone? I don't know what they knew, our battalion intelligence officers would have been charged with that, knowing that, but they could have just read it in the news if they wanted to. But, you know, the real issue was that the, the, the, should just didn't work, like, their radio just didn't work, it's just unbelievable. You know, they have these, these, these, these, uh, simgars, sci-gars right now, they can't remember that kind of anymore, they get sci-gars, but I never got what could get one to work, um, in the time that I was in the army, they just, it's just, it's, it's, equipment was really gruddy to, to a shocking degree, considering how much of all the stuff caused. It's the whole, it's the F-35 model scaled down to radio size. It's crazy. Oh my god. It was, it was also the advent of the sort of cell phone era. So, you know, people would just start using their own cell phones. Like, we mostly used walkie-talkies that have been bought, um, from like Walmart before we left. Wow, but when, when, when, when readers in Taurus got left behind, um, they had nothing. They had no walkie-talkie, they had no radio, um, and when they bailed out of that truck to take cover nearby, uh, they forgot their cantines, because they had unbuckled their, um, vest and belts when they were driving. So, they bailed out out of that truck with nothing but their personal weapons and the, and the extra, um, magazines that they had on their, on their persons, um, which wasn't that many, you know, basic load. I can't remember how much that is anymore, but I don't know, maybe like six mags. Um, and, you know, they're completely alone surrounded by an enemy element of, um, at least a hundred, I can't estimate. I don't really don't know. By the way, uh, years after this happened, um, I was in a bookstore, and, uh, I saw that, there, I saw this map market paperback by a British Army sniper named Dan Mills, his memoir called Sniper One. I looked at the back of it and it saw that he had been in Alamara in 2004, and I thought, I'll be damned this right with that ambush happened. We'll read stories. Y'all left behind. Started reading it and almost fell out of my chair, um, because he actually witnessed this, this event, this British Army sniper, who's, and a sniper's nested about a mile away. I actually saw it all happen. Wow. Um, uh, not up close, you know, I have a more granular view of it after interviewing these guys, but, um, through his scope, for shooting, through his scope, he was watching through his scope. Yeah. So, should anyone doubt the, the brassy of the story, it's also corroborated by Dan Mills, as well as I obtained the after-action port from, oh, well, I didn't actually obtain it through FOIA. The, so anytime someone dies, there's going to be an after-action report, that's for sure. So, I knew they must have done it. I actually managed to get a copy from Reedus, a sympathetic officer had, had exfiltrated one to him, and he gave it to me. I submitted a FOIA request on the Army for this document, uh, and they said that it didn't exist. Huh. Well, that was another lesson learned. Uh, when they say a FOIA document, a document you're trying to FOIA doesn't exist and can't, can't therefore be FOIA head, which is to say declassified or whatever. Um, what is the penalty for, like, why don't they lie all the time? I always kind of wonder, or how often do they lie? You know, actually, if I'm not mistaken, there are severe penalties for gunner employees who lie in connection with FOIA. I could be wrong about that. I just, I remember I was reading a statute once and I think it was some press files, like, damn it, serious. But you know what? The way that they probably are able to do it in this case, like, I submitted the, like, this is the first, I wrote the story about some journalism school. So I wasn't that proficient with FOIA and I submitted it to the US Army, just like the overall Army. And they probably did some cursory search. Who knows? I mean, this is a massive organization. And in order to really get a document like that, you would need to specify the command. Right. And it would need to be a more specific command. It's all in that document, the after-action review, which was signed by Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, who was the, who was the highest ranking officer in Iraq at that time. It was Commander of Multinational Forces in Iraq. Right. So this all definitely happened. It just didn't come out at the time. But so, like I was saying, these two guys take cover in this, it turns out it was an abandoned prison, a prison that was under construction for some reason they had stopped building it. And Amara, I was actually able to identify this building using satellite maps. And they took shelter there because it was filled with rubble and they were able to control the entrance and keep these in rage because the people of Amara were extremely opposed to the continued presence of British and American troops in their city. And the British had managed to, have been fighting them for weeks and had managed to come to some kind of agreement where they were going to just remain in their base and not patrol. And then the people were going to stop doing their nightly mortar attacks. They had a very tentative, like, I don't know, what am I trying to say, De Tante with the British? Yeah, like an understanding basically, which happens a lot, yeah. More or less. And so then my unit just comes plowing in, completely healed us of all of this. It's amazing. So total lack of communication between British intelligence and... It leads to this massive firefight in which many civilians are killed, some of the most horrific details because, you know, it wasn't just these two guys who entered everyone I could, it was on the convoy and they talked about how people were just laying dead in the street, lots of people were just laying dead in the street. Yeah. And so these guys are able to hold off the M\u0101ori fighters until about sundown. They're really low on ammo. I talked to both of those guys who needless to say, are less severely traumatized. Yeah. But, you know, the Redis Frouc said that he killed about 10 guys at the doorway and then Taurus, who really struggled with it because he's a Catholic and just couldn't handle. He was a very devout Catholic and he really struggled with the people that he had killed that day. But he said he'd killed about five guys right then at that doorway to that prison. But being completely, almost completely out of ammunition, they had to fall back into like this tower in the back and again, I will not belabor the story. Because there's lots of other things to talk about about the Iraq War besides this. But they take cover in this tower and then finally, when they're down to their last two bullets, they sneak out and just like jump from about a 30-foot drop, which the M\u0101ori fighters did not see because they were inside of the prison. It's really cinematic, I have to say. I mean, it's a grim as hell story. It's not a heroic story, but it is very cinematic and it's like kind of a black hawk down, but just grim as hell, kind of story. I tried many times and wasn't toxic and made into a movie. But the problem is that the moral of it, we just be so sacred cows. To topple sacred cows and just very depressing. Army leaves people behind. Yeah, the difference between black hawk down and that is really interesting. In black hawk down, of course, these are elite units and the presentives elite units. But they're up against this horrifying new kind of opposing force. There's nothing about how they don't have basic supplies, air cover or intelligence. They're not abandoned because they're being watched by a camera's above by the commanders out in base. It's just that they can't reach them. It doesn't make the US military look bad, but this is about bad intelligence, bad communications, taking crap care of soldiers, not giving a shit about them, lying about not leaving any soldiers behind. It overturns everything in a way. And yet, within that, there's these two guys who have this incredible struggle to stay alive. And far from being special forces soldiers, we were in like that sort of least elite unit in the whole US Army. And then on top of that, these guys were like the old guys in the unit because Rita's was 40 and Torres was 38, which is for the army is old. Oh, yeah, jumping down a 30 foot wall. Both of them are left with lifelong back injuries from that job. But coming out from our sort of writerly perspective, that's what attracted me to story. That's what I like about the story was that these guys were such underdogs. Yes. And they from after having jumped Rita's carried Torres, part of the way his towards his very fucked up, his back is very fucked up right then. So he carried him out into the desert. And they came to what was essentially an open sewer or some sort of drag line. And they traversed this sewer, sewer highway and used their weapons, which were as I said, empty except for one bullet piece. They had saved their fun. Each of them had saved their final round. But they used those empty magazines to kind of bluff. And they literally hijacked a civilian scar. It was a little dinky Kia sedan with four people in it. They ran off three of them, say, get lost. And then forced the fourth guy, the driver, they forced him at gunpoint to drive him, drive them to a Iraqi police station. Or they actually they didn't know. Of course, they can't communicate with the, they don't speak any Arabic. And the Iraqis didn't speak any English. But you know, these guys are completely done at this point. You know, they're just completely beat to hell. And totally exhausted and above all thirsty because like during this whole time, they had no water. And may an Iraqis very, very, very hot. The lack of water, they both emphasize that continuously to me. It was really, really, if they could have just done one thing, definitely grab those canteens. John, that reminds me of a war nerd, one of your war nerd pieces some years ago when everyone was talking civil war. And you know, who's going to be best prepared, and which gun do you need for the American Civil War coming? And your, your war nerd piece was like, whoever has control of the water reservoirs is the one who wins. Like, screw your arsenal, take control of the water reservoirs and you got it. At least west of the Mississippi, that's going to be the obvious show point. Anyway, sorry, go ahead. One of the things that Dan Mills says in his book is that he emphasizes that Redis and Torres got really lucky in their choice of, or they're accidentally ending up at that police station because he said most of those cops in Amara were completely in league with the Madi army would have just turned them over right away. Somehow, I don't know by what miracle these two police officers, this Iraqi police station, were on good terms with the British and someone like a British patrol which came and picked them up. And from there, they were rescued. And then they actually saw, they took them from there to a place called Camp Abnaji, which is just north of Amara. And they actually, right then, were reunited with the Lieutenant who had made the decision to leave them behind. And actually, awkward as they say. Yeah. This, it was this crazy chaotic moment where like that, there, the units on the one hand overjoyed to see these guys back alive. But then on the other hand, they're like, what the fuck you guys left us behind? Because you know, obviously the whole time that they were left behind, they're like, well, they left us behind, they the fucking left us behind. I can't believe it. They just can't believe that the, you know, left them behind and no one's coming back to get them. Yeah. And that they had to fight their way out alone. Yeah. So they confronted the Lieutenant and it led to basically like a food fight and almost like a riot there in this chauho until they were finally separated. But in the aftermath, what happened was that recent tours were basically punished for having survived. Right. Stricted their weapons, they were basically put in quarantine. They were interrogated by military intelligence officers, I was a military intelligence officer came down from division headquarters in Baghdad to interview everyone. Obviously, they told us all, we're not to speak about the incident. Right. So they wanted to make sure it didn't make it to the media. Right. And we were ordered and no uncertain terms that we would not speak about the sensitive. It was under investigation by MI and then we were not to speak about it. The readers and tours, we didn't see them for about a month after that. They had their weapons taken away in their place in some other housing. And, you know, talking to both of those guys years later, you know, they told me that the MI agents were basically casting doubt on their version of events, trying to dissuade them from saying that it happened. And, um, most were short that never came out, never emerged, never lead to the press. And, uh, readers and tours didn't get any, any kind of like metals or recognition for the incredible valor that they displayed. They didn't even get purple hearts for their injuries because of some technicality where like, there has to be witnesses to show that it was, like they said, they couldn't prove that it was the result of enemy action. What was it they sustained? Jesus. And they probably weren't willing to go interview the Maddi army guys. I guess not. They put in readers for a silver star, but then the 84th downgraded it to bronze and then the citation was ultimately rejected, yeah, for lack of witnesses. It's, it's, it's deranged. Unfuckin' believable. And it really left me with lasting sentences and tours, like my, my own unit, um, and, you know, the chain of command in general and how it, how it operates to, how officers protect their own, you know, the dynamic train officers and then listed because at the end of our deployment, all of our officers awarded each other bronze stars, including that lieutenant who left, uh, those guys behind. He got a bronze star. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And not that it matters, not that it really matters, like, it's an insult. It's an insult, man. It's an insult. He said, you know, I'm, I was happy to be alive, but yeah, at the same time, like, it is an insult. It's an insult. Um, and it, it goes to show, you know, or it goes to show up or put the lie to certain myths, uh, they're very cherished in US military culture, such as we never leave a man behind, or the like officers are out there in the lead, uh, or, or like our radios work. Yeah. I know. Yeah. Or that we respond truthfully to flaring quests. Yeah. Yeah. People should, people want to read more, please check out the article. Like I said, it is the, is the first one I wrote for real and so. It's a really good article and it's, it's quite depressing. And you also quote, uh, spoke to what a, a, a lieutenant Colonel who is a philosophy professor at West Point who writes on battlefield ethics. So this is from, you know, the top of the, of that world. And he says, he tells you the soldiers creed. Is he telling you this or is he's just what he says the soldiers creed as quote aspirational, a quote motivational quote, not a law of war, quote, the job of a commission officer is to exercise judgment, not reflexively follow a motto. In other words, you fuck you if you believe it, you know, everyone for themselves. I mean, God has a grim, man. You know, I can't say I completely disagree with what the, what he's expressing there. Like you, you maybe put it up position as, as a military officer, like, um, am I going to go drag out to you guys dead bodies, even if it's going to cost me like five guys who get killed. Is that the right choice? I don't know. The, what the, the really thing that really wrinkled me is, is the way that they covered it up. Yeah. And didn't, uh, and basically punish readers to us or having inconveniently survived when they were, right, I still been dead because we were informed that they were dead. The unit was gathered together. We were told a, oh, you were there when you were told that he was, so you like saw the aftermath of this whole thing personally. Okay. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. That's me out. Like I said, I saw them leave off the gate on the way to the bar from the lot. And then when the convoy came back, I'll shoot up, you know, that we were told that recent tours were dead. So we're right, Medina and Oheda. And so when they reappeared like three days later, it was like they're literally coming back from the dead. Wow. Oh, shit. You're alive. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much. How long did it take to get new equipment for the, I mean, how long did it take to, I remember there was a lot of talk about uparmoring vehicles. Did, did you ever get officially uparmored or re-equipped with decent communications? No, we never had it. Not when I was there. What years were you there from? I was there from December 2003 to March 2005. That's astonishing. I think people reach, I mean, amount of money they threw at Iraq, but they didn't throw any money at that. It was part of the mismanagement that prevailed that time, which got a lot of people killed. They just weren't as good as they thought they were going to be at running a war. John, I think, and you know, we'll talk about this probably when we talk about the war and some of the, I don't know, thinking going into it. But I think the basic thinking was, like, we're going to win this fast. They'll be overwhelmed. They'll look to us like white gods. And that's it. Like, why, there's no need to prepare for anything else because everything's going to go great. And anybody who says, but wait a minute, is not with the team. He's got a bad attitude. So move them out, put them out to pasture and find somebody who's got a good attitude. And just keep zooming along. So I can imagine, right? I mean, I can see that corporate thinking, basically. But I think there's also procurement. Well, we should get into this later. But there's a reason the F-35 gets paid for because services always want big ticket, gold-plated items. And the things Gabriel or R.J., for example, has done some really good work on this. The things that don't get priority are unsexy stuff like radios and armor plating transport vehicles. That's very true. It's funny. I mean, the Russians have similar problems with their military campaigns. But we get a lot of reporting about the Russian problems because the implication is there's so much difference, so much worse than we are. Now, there's something that happens to armies everywhere. It was happening to armies after the Battle of Chrissie. Oh boy, that heavy cavalry looks beautiful. Yeah, but the shut up, that heavy cavalry looks beautiful. We don't care about any long both. The attacks on reserve units that were lacking in armor was also a reflection of this political confusion and just the strategic failure of the word self because the fact that the Iraqis didn't want us there after a certain amount of time. Yeah. And also that they would specifically target non-inventory non-combat units because obviously the insurgents are not stupid. They're capable of observing and making smart decisions. One of them is like, hey, this is a lot easier when we attack these reserve units that don't have armor. Instead of the scary looking infantry columns have helicopters flying low above them and they're all up armored and bristling with decalibrate machine guns. They're not going to attack that. They're going to attack the soft targets. I remember that was a big complaint, John, among at least the sort of the pundit and the Republican class. Like, wait a minute, this isn't fair. This isn't real because they have to come out and do a set piece battle against us. Otherwise, it's not really happening. It's just fake. It's not fair. Yeah, when IEDs became the prevailing method of fighting for the insurgency, that really reached a peak. This is not fair. Therefore, it's not really happening. It doesn't really say that in a war. They always remind me of that far side thing with the wagon train in a circle and fire arrows are lighting up the covers of the wagon train and one guy is saying to the other way, can they do that? Let me ask you as somebody who was there who joined, so when you joined, you got to Iraq via the National Guard. When did you reserve? The National Guard reserve, is that right? It's actually different. The reserve is a national formation and the National Guard units are state. I joined in 2002 after... I mean, it was such... I was thinking this morning, it was a long time ago, the first time I'd ever been on a plane was when I went to basic training. The first time I'd ever left the country was when I went to Iraq. Although, that's not sure I'd been in Mexico, so I look close to the board. But I really had little idea of what I was doing when I signed the paperware. They make it so easy. After my freshman year of college at UT, I joined the Army Reserve. I don't remember patriotism, post-9-11 patriotism, plane and especially pertinent role in that choice. But I'm sure it must have been there somewhere in the background because of the atmosphere at the time. Because of the way the timing works, I couldn't go to basic training until the following summer, but I had summer vacation. The interim is to sort of drumbeat towards the world with Iraq. I'm sitting there thinking, well, it's interesting that the whole WMD conspiracy theory and that media phenomenon that it was, it was just incredibly alienated and terrifying because you saw how the government was able to sort of use the media as a puppet or almost like ventriloquist style to make all of the talking heads talking the same, talking a single voice. But if you had access to the internet, anyone who was interested could look up quickly find information that showed that this is not true. Like there were a lot of people at the time. It is not at all the biggest myth we need to fight against is the idea that everyone was fooled. They would love to have that as cover for themselves, for their showing for the war. Oh, well, everyone believed in the WMDs. No, they didn't. They did a ton of work and just shutting up the ones who didn't. That's right. And just having a normal amount of curiosity at that age, I was able to find information that showed me that this is not true. They're doing this for some other reason, especially the big thing that they emphasized at the time, not just the weapons and mass destruction, but the bomb was seen as in the League of Al Qaeda. It was a big important part of it. The case was just as much about that as it was about weapons and mass destruction. And that was particularly the weapons and mass destruction. Obviously bullshit. You could see that that wasn't true at all. The people in your unit, did any percentage of them believe the prevailing media stories about the WMDs and Al Qaeda? Yeah, I vividly remember, especially because we were over there during the 2004 election. We were there in November 2004. And so we would have these debates in the barracks and I remember it being about evenly divided. And I remember real Akram and I can't remember the guy's name anymore. There was one guy that I would really get into about this stuff. I was against the Iraq War from day one. I wrote letters to my college newspaper saying that the WMD Al Qaeda thing was like already basically arguing with people before there was Twitter. And they would go on. ours is called the firing line. Daily Texan. You could get into it over a period of weeks. I would write a letter and this other student would write a letter and I would respond to him and the paper would just keep publishing these responses to one another. So you get into these extended Akram on these debates. So I was getting into that with people about the Iraq thing. But you know what? I didn't have a choice once I got my orders. I guess I could have technically. There was a guy in my unit who dropped a weight on his foot on purpose and I have to deploy. And I remember how poor bastard what they did was they wrapped up his foot took away his weapon and said you're coming with us except you're just going to be on you know you're going to be sitting in the headquarters building. And the ostracization of him was so it was sad it was sad. I can't even say that I wasn't a part of it. You know everyone looked at him as this guy. This cat total coward who had done this thing injured his foot on purpose to avoid going. McNary was his name. McNary. What was your attitude? Just sort of like well I'm against it but I signed up and it's just the way it goes. Where you scared, where you like I mean pretty much that yeah like I don't have a choice or they're going to make my life so miserable it'd be better just to go right. And yeah like you said like I kind of felt like I had done it to myself. Right. I really didn't have anyone to blame myself. When there's a lot of culture is telling you go die. I mean you could blame the whole culture but yeah that's true that's true. And I mean again I was 19 years old. Exactly. Exactly. The type of decisions you make at that age. Yep. They're not always most reflective. It's a good age for from the recruiters point of view to go out there. They're all cycles at that age. There's a great video that's on I don't know where it took to occur. You two or something where they just go around. It's new. It's from the modern day army. What they're asking soldiers if you could say one thing to recruit or what would you say? There's just one guy after another saying fuck you. Yeah. So I was telling you before the show you know that I mean what this story is about is you know a heroism versus lies and cover-ups and a culture of cover-ups and also just the cruelty in the sort of hierarchy of the military as well. I was telling you about this piece by Dan Frookin where he said you know the officially 32,000 US servicemen who served as people who served in Iraq. There were 32,000 wounded but unofficially when you look at the statistics the numbers closer to half a million injured one way or another it just depends on how the injuries are massaged when they're you know so on and so forth. From your experience where there are a lot of I don't know stories like not as dramatic as this but just a sense of people not being taken care of people's wounds and conditions and the way they were screwed up by the war being pushed completely off books things like that like was it pretty common just from your own personal experience or no. Good question I'm not sure thank God I wasn't injured myself I know that quite a few guys were I wouldn't be surprised if there's a lot of type of injuries that you get like you know like back injuries and things like sprints things things at the time you think you can shake it off but because you got to realize you're driving around these huge heavy trucks and bad roads I mean there there were if I remember one of our dump trucks flipped and the guys were really banged up lucky to be alive I can I imagine that you know it wasn't as if they were considered wounded in action right but I would be shocked if those guys didn't feel that that was injuries to this day right well then there's PTSD and all the people have had depression and suicides and stuff like yeah there seems to be a lot of evidence that combat experience leads to depression at a level high high much higher than the general population with with one qualifier I would add it's it's combat experience that's not connected to a sort of national cause or yeah yeah a cause that you can believe in that can sustain you right in the importance of this sacrifice later on you know I can't say I'm the biggest fan of well the Sebastian younger wrote a book about specifically this called tribe and I think that his thesis is basically correct or he's saying that you know actually human beings can shake off combat pretty easily and can do and see witness horrible things if they are returning to basically a tribal context in which they know that they've sacrificed for a cause and that everyone else was in it with them and you know one thing we can say about America's wars after 9-11 is that sure as hell is not the case yes yes yeah there's there's another factor in in counting injuries which seemed to be highlighted during the burn pit scandal like what are you calling an injury I mean you may not even know where you may hide right in the elite the knowledge that something is an injury and then it will turn out that a lot of people who got burn pit duty are suffering the same illnesses as people who get stuck with the job of cleaning up fire sites you know I have it's funny actually it worked a lot on a burn pit and because we were engineers and so we had a lot of heavy earth moving equipment which is always in demand in kind of crazy ways the actually I'll say two things about that it actually took us to some significant back sites of the war in 2004 which was a pivotal year in the war we went to Samara because after the first infantry division it was the Samara was the first city to fall to al-Qaeda in Iraq Abu Musal al-Qaizu which would later become ISIS of course and the first infantry division assaulted Samara in October 2004 to take it back and this is an elite up to the battle of Fallujah and my unit including me personally what we were sent in during the battle in order to lay gravel on top of because they seized this like police station in the city center and they were using as their forward operating base to do patrols and it was filled with this dust there was a very lightweight dust the consistency of talcum powder and with the tanks driving around and made it stirred up so much dust it made it impossible to breathe and so rather ridiculously we're called in a sort of reserve unit again called into dump like haul one load of gravel after another like for days on end and weeks on end just hauling gravel from a quarry north of Samara into that police station in the downtown area wow and or just suppressed to suppress the dust how many people in the course had out from that well I was when I was saying earlier about taking that that round to the door of my truck but um the calm was very long but we would we would have to dismount and and we'd be shooting uh alongside the infantry guys who were blocking the the alleyways and so forth it was just it was just chaos it felt like pure chaos at the time sure somebody was and you know that operation actually went well uh it was easier than Fallujah but being there on the ground it seemed like pure chaos but later we went to Fallujah to um well it's rather get uh grizzly or ghastly but you know to dig mass graves your unit yeah my unit dug the dug the graves well outside the city because they had a lot of bodies many many bodies um and whose bodies lead the ministries the bodies of uh basically all of the men of military age they would call them right men and boys between 15 because before they assaulted Fallujah in November 2004 they had the city surrounded and this is something I've asked everyone that uh because it was just a rumor in the early days but I'm satisfied now after all these years of talking to people um that this is how it actually happened they they refused or they turned back any um males that were trying to leave the city right they let the women and children leave but none of the boys and men could leave a Fallujah before they assaulted it um they were meant to be killed well they had no they were given no choice but to stay in fights um just me which is so they were meant to be killed right yeah yeah and they went house to house um and you know some of them were taking captive captive okay and just they didn't just murder everybody but um they definitely killed the majority of the towns are the city's male inhabitants um and that was really the peak of violence in Iraq we were called in just because you know they had to dispose of those bodies did you get to see I imagine then did you get to see the the city I mean it was as I understand it I don't know 90 percent of the buildings were destroyed no I wasn't a part of the element that was it because you know they would just grab five guys ten guys I see we're just twenty five out of the guys I know I wasn't even sent to Fallujah just oh my yeah a couple of guys from my platoon I went there again it all depended on the I drew something called an M1075 PLS and so that wasn't needed it's kind of a has like a hydraulic crane on the back and so the guys that went to Fallujah were guys who drove um bulldozers right front and loaders and excavators things like that right or the trucks the or the trucks to haul them the low boy trucks to haul them so I wasn't there but I heard about it first and from the guys that have been there I got to say when so when the battle of muddie upole was happening I think it was in that time all over social media you had people a lot of blue checks military blue checks and so on saying like you know this is the most evil what Russia's doing and I don't mean to justify it because I said from the beginning the war is a crime you know the invasion is criminal whatever but but I can't stand this historical revisionism it drives me nuts I mean if the lesson we learn as we're good they're bad then then it's all wrong um and they were making it seem like the there were people saying directly the US never does this and has never done this it's never raised a city to the ground and people started saying a lot of people were you know most people were retweeting and affirming and yeah the Russians and a few people would be like what about Fallujah you know and then you go online and you look and you try and look up Fallujah and what really like what really went on there I mean you're alluding to some of this here where I've read this in another account too by a Iraqi journalist yeah they surrounded the city completely put it you know fenced it off completely walled it off with armor and so on and only and would not let out fighting age males and so they couldn't get out even if they wanted to you know and the city was raised to the ground and white phosphorus and so on and so forth and people reminded them like that city was completely destroyed that's how you know unfortunately that's like how urban warfare goes and you know you just shouldn't be invading in the first place but like it's not unusual when you actually get down to the urban warfare and it's just surprising like there's no looking back on it there's no real like I don't know like with something with I don't know the Vietnam war some other battles or something I can't think of right now but there's no real account that you can look up and say yeah this is really what happened in Fallujah and it was you know just the basics like all these people are killed all these buildings were destroyed you know like he's the lepo kind of thing or what we got from he's the lepo or Grozny or something yeah yeah on the on the Wikipedia page for the battle of Fallujah it says it 800 right in a meeper killed right really wow yeah based on the Iraq body count right you know before before they were osin and siop's like belling cat or right let's see the other one institute for the study of war yeah it was the Iraq body count project which seemed like a neutral organization but systematically seeded the internet with order of magnitude under accounts yeah yeah and the their methodology was that was that they just counted from news articles they counted people that have been killed so if there was a AP article that said you know 30 insurgents were killed and one marine died or something like that then that was and it was just basically in a did a project of addition using all of those that they could putting them together so what I'm saying is to be obvious is that this methodology results in clear under account because yes you're missing everything that hasn't been written about or or on anyway it's a real a real serious count would have involved you know a study involving hospitals and mortgitions and death records things like that there's never been anything remotely somewhat I seem to recall the Iraq body count when when it was called out at some point 10 15 years ago and it turned out they got hundreds of thousands of dollars of government funding and and they react to kind of like bellinka yeah I think it was through the US institute a piece it was one of these groups set up by basically by Bill Casey and the reaction was and you see this sometimes oh as if as if us getting money from the mad any influence on us that's just a smear it's like well actually it does have an influence on you money is tends to do that you know yeah and also the reason they're giving you money like why are they giving you money anyway yeah I think it was when the Lancet came out with his own count that people started to doubt the Iraq body count yes well the Iraq body counts they by their own admission they say that hey this is this is necessarily an undercount but it doesn't stop it from being just sort of when people are just casually looking for a source to cite yep it works to get to like as I said to sort of see the internet with all those undercounts but yeah I do think that the battle of alluages come to stand in people's imaginations in the sort of cultural memory as um you know a real atrocity or just uh peak violence in this war that uh went all wrong and you know you're talking about the comparison mario but well there was also the battle of Mosul in 2016 although that was done through proxy forces yes it it wasn't not entirely the proxy forces primarily right also the battle of raka you know this high water marsever in combat in the two-first century yeah Copern did some good articles on how little attention those got compared to East Aleppo which was happening at the same time yeah so let by was more politically convenient of course well they had by that point mooched the new model of us warfare which is proxy warfare managed by special forces and managed by intelligence agencies often supported by the us air force and that that that's a new paradigm of war fighting comes directly out of the Iraq war and then surgery 2007 2008 right that leads me to one question i wanted to ask you sorry i keep you so long but did your units behavior doctrine equipment change in the time you were there uh not my particular unit our whole chain of commandments relieved at one point um because we were just a cluster of but that that was kind of a local issue no there's oh i don't think that change happens on the unit level um you're in for a deployment with your uh chain of command and your guys and you kind of don't change for that for that court of that deployment but now there is change you see it at a higher level um you know over a longer time period it's you know and the main one the main thing that they changed is as a result of the Iraq war was the was to stop using conventional units and and and start uh relying on jaysoc uh and on special forces and so com units more generally um and having proxy forces uh do the real fighting um and uh just and just manage it from afar and keep it all secret so the second or the third Iraq war however you want to call it the the anti-isus war from 2015-2018 was entirely prosecuted by jaysoc and everything about it was kept secret and so that's why you mentioned a moment ago that you know there's almost no reporting around that from the perspective of the uh managers and planners of these things it was it was much more successful yes it was surprising to me again to see through social media interactions how few people really um people who are supposed to know and who should know maybe they didn't want to but how few people really knew the condition like what was done to muslim raqqah um i mean you may support it or not support it but you also need to know what was done to pacify those cities and you know take ISIS out they destroyed those cities they leveled them completely and killed a lot of civilians and they just kept it from us and um yeah that model works pretty well like it it's like information is like a spigot they can turn on and off using some of their go-betweens like in their cutouts like you know in the osent world and so on so you can flood people with some information and and just hide other information they have it down they seem to have it down pretty well they really do and you know i think an important point to emphasize about the Iraq war on the 20th anniversary invasion is that the Iraq war never ended um it didn't end in the way that the Vietnam were ended because there's still US troops and Iraq right now thousands of them that's a gristh still there's still fight and it's spilled over into Syria and have uh US troops occupying a third of Syria um and they're not just sitting around uh monitoring the highways you know from from Tehran to Damascus at the Tamp crossing or whatever they're actually doing operations and every once in a while so Khan will put out every month in fact so Khan will put out the you know it's a list of operations that month they're doing unilateral uh lethal operations so jasak guys delta forest guys are going out killing um Iraqis and Syrians on a weekly basis in Iraq and in Syria um and in fact four delta forest soldiers are using three delta forest soldiers for just wounded in Syria and Derazor uh from namastegan just about three weeks ago along with one of their working dogs um so that tells you that the kind of work that's still going on in the background just under the veil of special operations secrecy that is basically gets a pass and exempted from reporting on um right you know in the mixture media right okay I think we can wrap this up um this was a great talk thanks for talking to us Seth and telling us about you your experience in the wreck really appreciate it thanks for having me on quick question do you have anything in the works right now I mean I know you've been writing about the Fort Bragg murders and all that insanity um that it's going on I wouldn't even know what to characterize it as right now but uh you working on that are you working on anything else I'm working on a book really focused on on the book just trying to finish it okay um not really doing anything else at the moment but looking forward to open it when it comes out definitely thank you thank you guys so much for all the great coverage y'all do I really depend on your coverage to give me updates for what's going on Ukraine uh kind of checked out otherwise but you know y'all's episodes on it give me a tune to events there also the airtree and etiopian war yeah episodes really interesting as well nobody else is talking about it no way that's amazing yes thanks Seth appreciating thanks all right thanks for joining us all right take care bye bye bye yeah okay that was our interview with Seth Harp contributing editor rolling stone and friend of the show that was a great interview actually we initially thought we were gonna just talk to him for about you know 20 30 minutes I know he was he was a little under the weather too well we all kind of are one another um to uh to kind of set up things we were gonna talk about which is sort of the Iraq war our memories of it what it looked like from Russia and the the media's yeah the media's memory of it I mean how how they as we say yeah they lived experience at the time um but the interview because it was so interesting the stories he told and just kind of getting really that first person story of somebody who was there uh it was it just went on longer and there's a lot more interestingly thought so rather than um you know making this like a two and a half hour episode let's just I think we can wrap it up now and then we'll do part two in a separate episode which is going to be more about the stories that we've collected uh again what we saw from Russia and also what we would like to remember that they would like us not to remember I think is sort of how to put it right if nothing else uh the Iraq war generated some of the most astonishing not in a good way but astonishing media coverage of of history really uh and we got to go back through that and then people covering up their past and some thread there are Russia threads before through Kosovo through Putin's opposition to the Iraq war and then up through some of the same people 20 years ago reappearing as um sort of rewashing their reputations now as you know cheerleaders for the Ukraine war and these are the some of the same villains you know and then you have people like Michael McFaul we'll get into this on the next episode Michael McFaul who's literally just came out and lied straight up when the Russian invasion happened claiming he was a big opponent of the Iraq war and we'll talk about that we'll see what Mikey really had to say when that war was going on yeah there's uh plenty of indictments to go around um some of them hilarious some of them kind of yes disgusting a lot of them both at the same time anyway so we'll wrap it up thanks again Seth Harp our guest for coming on we'll post the link as well to his article in Rolling Stone that we discussed and anyway talk to you again soon thanks everyone thanks everybody bye you",
